In 1944, retreating German troops destroyed its four-latticed mast antenna system which was used in conjunction with the existing 900-KW transmitter. On 19 October 1952 a new long wave transmitter with an output of 250 kilowatts was put into service at Allouis. It featured three special prism aerials, which were suspended between steel framework mastsat a height of 308 meters. Transmitting power was increased to 600 kilowatts in 1957, to 1,000 kW in 1974 and to 2,000 kW in 1981. The system attains its full transmitting potential during daylight hours. The antenna system underwent extensive conversion in 1974. The prism aerials were removed and antenna masts were increased to a height of 350 meters. In addition, a second 350-meter high mast was build to provide better coverage within France. Since 1977, the Allouis transmitter not only broadcasts France Inter radio programs, but also transmits standard time signals for AMDS. Wave frequencies are generated on the basis of an atomic clock located in the transmitter station and serves for calibration frequency purposes.
