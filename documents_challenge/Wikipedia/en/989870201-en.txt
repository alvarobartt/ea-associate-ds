It was sunk in 1945, with the loss of many lives while laden with prisoners from concentration camps.HistoryThe 27,561 gross ton'' Cap Arcona'', named after Cape Arkona on the island of Rügen in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, was launched in 1927. It was considered one of the most beautiful ships of the time. It was the largest German ship on the South American run. It carried upper-class travelers and steerage-class emigrants, mostly to South America.http://www.arteprintas.ch/postkarten/caparcona.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;In 1940, it was taken over by the Kriegsmarine and used in the Baltic Sea as an accommodation ship. In 1942 it was used as a stand-in for the doomed  in the German film version of the disaster. In early 1945, the Kriegsmarine reactivated it for Operation Hannibal, and it was used to transport 25,795 German soldiers and civilians from East Prussia to western Germany.Williams, David, Wartime Disasters at Sea, Patrick Stephens Ltd., Nr Yeovil, Somerset, UK, 1997, pp.235-36.Koberger, Jr., Charles W., Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees, Praeger, NY, 1989, p. 87.Situation before the British air-raidIn the last few weeks of the war in Europe, the Swedish diplomat Count Folke Bernadotte, vice-president of the Red Cross, was organising the removal of Danish and Norwegian prisoners from German concentration camps to neutral Sweden — a scheme known as the White Buses. In practice, the scheme also included other nationalities.On April 26, 1945, the Cap Arcona was loaded with prisoners from the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg and was brought into the Bay of Lübeck along with two smaller ships, Athen and Thielbek.On April 30, 1945, two Swedish ships Magdalena and Lillie Matthiessen sailed from Lübeck, the first with 223 western European prisoners, for the most part French-speaking, who were transferred from the Thielbek to the Magdalena, and the second with 225 women from Ravensbrück on board for transportation to hospitals in Sweden. This first rescue operation possibly used information from British Intelligence, indicating possible knowledge of the prisoners on board.On May 2, 1945, Second Army reached the towns of Lübeck and Wismar. No.6 Commando, 1st Special Service Brigade commanded by Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, and 11th Armoured Division commanded by Major-General George P. B. Roberts entered Lübeck without resistance. The International Red Cross informed George P. B. Roberts that 7,000-8,000 prisoners were on board ships in Bay of Lübeck.

Stevenson, by No. 193 Squadron, based in Ahlhorn (Großenkneten), led by Squadron Leader D. M. Taylor, by No. 263 Squadron, based in RAF Ahlhorn, led by Squadron Leader Martin Trevor Scott Rumbold, by No. 197 Squadron RAF, led by Squadron Leader K. J. Harding also at Ahlhorn, and by No. 198 Squadron based at Plantlünne led by Group Captain Johnny Baldwin. These Hawker Typhoon Mark 1B fighter-bombers used High Explosive 60 lb rocket projectiles, bombs, and 20 mm cannons.Unknown to the RAFFrom the Till report of June 1945: "The Intelligence Officer with 83 Group RAF has admitted on two occasions - first to Lt H. F. Ansell of this Team (when it was confirmed by a wing commander present) and on a second occasion to the Investigating Officer when he was accompanied by Lt. H. F. Ansell - that a message was received on 2 May 1945 that these ships were loaded with KZ prisoners but that, although there was ample time to warn the pilots of the planes who attacked these ships on the following day, by some oversight the message was never passed on...From the facts and from the statement volunteered by the RAF Intelligence Officer, it appears that the primary responsibility for this great loss of life must fall on the British RAF personnel who failed to pass to the pilots concerned the message they received concerning the presence of KZ prisoners on board these ships"., the ships were carrying between 7,000-8,000 prisoners from the German concentration camps in Neuengamme, Stutthof and Mittelbau-Dora, half of whom were Russian and Polish prisoners-of-war, along with others from 24 nations, including French, Danish, and Dutch.Welcome to the Imperial War Museum : The sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, 30 January 1945: the greatest maritime disaster in history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The survivors of the attack who reached the shore were shot by SS troops, although 350 prisoners managed to escape the massacre. Allan Wyse, formerly of 193 Fighter Squadron, said "We used our cannon fire at the chaps in the water … we shot them up with 20 mm cannons in the water. Horrible thing, but we were told to do it and we did it. That's war." China Daily, 2000-03-07. Among the survivors was Erwin Geschonneck, who later became a notable German actor, and whose story was made into a film in 1982.About 490 of the guards, SS, and crew were rescued by German boats.[[Image:Cap Arcona sinking.jpg|thumb|right|The tragic end of the Cap Arcona]] Photos of the burning ships, listed as Deutschland, Thielbek, and Cap Arcona, and survivors swimming in the cold Baltic Sea (seven degrees Celsius), were taken on a reconnaissance mission over the Bay of Lübeck by F-6 aircraft of the USAAF's 161st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron around 5:00 pm, shortly after the attackhttp://www.militarygnome.com/html/thielbeck.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The capsized hulk of the Cap Arcona later drifted ashore, and the beached wreck was broken up in 1949.For weeks after the attack, the bodies of victims washed ashore, where they were collected and buried in mass graves at Neustadt in Holstein, Scharbeutz and Timmendorfer Strand.Flemish Belgian Web site. http://www.getuigen.be/Getuigenis/Van-Pee-Raymond/tkst.htm  For nearly thirty years, parts of skeletons continued to wash ashore, until the last find, by a twelve-year-old boy, in 1971.Günther Schwarberg: Angriffsziel "Cap Arcona", Steidl Verlag, 1998 Göttingen.According to documents at the Dutch Institute of War Documentation (NIOD), the government of Sweden had warned the British government that prisoners were aboard the ships.[[Image:Neustad Holstein Cap Arcona.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Cap Arcona victims http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfriedhof_f%C3%BCr_die_Toten_der_Cap_Arcona-_und_Thielbek-Katastrophe at Neustadt in Holstein.]] The prisoners were of 28 different nationalities: American, Belarussian, Belgian, Canadian, Czechoslovakian, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourger, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swiss, Ukrainian, Yugoslavian and others.See alsoJunyō Maru - Japanese "hell ship" torpedoed while transporting about 6,000 prisoners of war and forced laborers.Ukishima Maru - Imperial Japanese Navy vessel sunk while transporting 4,000 to 5,000 Korean forced laborers.ReferencesSourcesRoy Nesbit, Cap Arcona: atrocity or accident?.
