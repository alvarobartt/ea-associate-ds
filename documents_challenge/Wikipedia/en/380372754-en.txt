(TV tower)]] The Rotes Rathaus () is the town hall of Berlin, located on Rathausstraße in the borough of Berlin-Mitte. It is the home to the governing mayor and the government of the Federal state of Berlin. The name of the landmark building dates from the facade design with red clinker bricks.The town hall was built between 1861 and 1869 in the style of the north Italian High Renaissance by Hermann Friedrich Waesemann. The architecture of the tower is reminiscent of the cathedral's tower of Laon in France. It replaced more, partial buildings dating from the Middle Ages by a whole street block.The building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in World War II. Located in the Soviet sector, it served as the town hall of East Berlin after its reconstruction during the 1950s to the original plans, while the Rathaus Schöneberg was domicile of the West Berlin Senate. After German reunification the administration of unified Berlin officially moved in 1991.External linksCityMayors featureRed Town Hall 360° PanoramaCategory:Buildings and structures in Berlin Category:City and town halls in Germany Category:1869 architectureaf:Rotes Rathaus br:Rotes Rathaus ca:Rotes Rathaus da:Rotes Rathaus de:Rotes Rathaus es:Rotes Rathaus fr:Rotes Rathaus it:Rotes Rathaus nl:Rotes Rathaus no:Rotes Rathaus pl:Czerwony Ratusz w Berlinie ru:Красная ратуша (Берлин) fi:Berliinin raatihuone sv:Rotes Rathaus uk:Берлінська ратуша
