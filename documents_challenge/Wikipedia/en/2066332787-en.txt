 The World Championships in Athletics is an event organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Originally, it was organised every four years, but this changed in 1991, and it has since been organised biennially.HistoryThe idea of having an Athletics World Championships was around well before the competitions first event in 1983. In 1913, the IAAF decided that the Olympic Games would serve as the World Championships for athletics. This was considered suitable for over 50 years until in the 1960's the desire of many IAAF members to have their own World Championships began to grow. In 1976 at the IAAF Council Meeting in Puerto Rico an Athletics World Championships separate from the Olympic Games was approved.Following bids from both Stuttgart, West Germany and Helsinki, Finland, the IAAF Council awarded the inaugural competition to Helsinki, to take place in 1983 and be held in the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (where the 1952 Summer Olympics were held).Over the years the competition has grown in size. In 1983 an estimated 1,300 athletes from 154 countries participated. The opening ceremonies in 2001 were broadcast live from Edmonton to an estimated viewing audience of 4 billion people. The event included the men's marathon, and music composed by Second City alumni Jan Randall. By the 2003 competition, in Paris, it had grown to 1,907 athletes from 203 countries with coverage being transmitted to 179 different countries.There has also been a change in the schedule over the years, with several new events, mostly for women, being added. By 2005 the schedule for men and women was almost equal. The only differences being the men had the extra event of the 50 km Walk, while women competed in the 100 m Hurdles and Heptathlon compared to the men in the 110m Hurdles and Decathlon respectively.The following shows when new events were added for the first time.1987, women's 10,000 m and 10 km walk were added.1993, women's triple jump was added.1995, women's 5000 m was added, replacing the 3000 m race.1999, women's pole vault and hammer were added and the women's 20 km walk replaced the 10 km walk.2005, women's 3000 m Steeplechase was added.ChampionshipsFor the detailed article, click on the year.OrderLink to specificarticles by yearCityCountryDateVenueNo. of EventsNo. ofAthletes11983HelsinkiAug 7 - Aug 14Olympiastadion]]411,35521987RomeAug 28 - Sept 6Stadio Olimpico431,45131991TokyoAug 23 - Sept 1National Olympic Stadium]]431,51741993StuttgartAug 13 - Aug 22Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion441,68951995GothenburgAug 5 - Aug 13Ullevi441,80461997AthensAug 1 - Aug 10Olympiako Stadio]]441,88271999SevilleAug 20 - Aug 29Estadio Olímpico de la Cartuja461,82182001Edmonton]]Aug 3 - Aug 12Commonwealth Stadium]]461,67792003Saint-DenisAug 23 - Aug 31Stade de France461,679102005HelsinkiAug 6 - Aug 14Olympiastadion]]471,688112007OsakaAug 24 - Sept 2Nagai Stadium471,981122009BerlinAug 22 - Aug 30Olympiastadion]]132011DaeguAug 27 - Sept 4Daegu Stadium]]142013MoscowAug 24 - Sept 1Luzhniki StadiumAll-time medal table 1983-20071114615923423351371213272223724 (Federal Republic of Germany)2626348652127287662119155571716639816141141913242663101114123711101111321210116271310331614911123215891128168782317729306618775191975921207582021735152261512332360392458821255641526555152753715285321029531930475163145101932443113340373435101835316103631153731043831043930144023054122154222044321034421034520134620024714054813374913265012035111135210235310125410125510125610015710015810015905510600459610336620235630202640202650202660112670112680112690112700112710112720112730101740101750033760022770011780011790011800011810011820011830011Total4914944881473NOTE: The Federal Republic of Germany refers to the former West Germany (1983-90) and the unified Germany (1990-present) NOTE: Some United States medals are expected to be stripped following the Marion Jones drug admission in 2007.CeremoniesThe opening and closing ceremonies of the 8th IAAF World Championships held in Edmonton, Alberta in 2001 were broadcast live to over 200 countries and featured a thousand voice choir and original music by Jan Randall.Other Athletics World Championship eventsPrior to the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Helsinki in 1983 there had been several single events and races in the years leading up to them which were considered World Championships in those events.
