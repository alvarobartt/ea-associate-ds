For a while he was parish priest at Clichy, but in 1612 he began to serve the Gondi family. He was confessor and spiritual director to Mme de Gondi, and he began giving peasant missions on the estate with her aid.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15434c.htm&lt;/ref&gt;In 1622 de Paul was appointed chaplain to the galleys, and in this capacity he gave missions for the galley-slaves.Michael Walsh, ed.

On 13 August 1729, Vincent was declared Blessed by Pope Benedict XIII. He was canonized nearly eight years later by Pope Clement XII on 16 June 1737. In 1885, Pope Leo XIII gave him as patron to the sisters of Charity.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15434c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He is also patron to the Brothers of Charity.St. Vincent's body was exhumed in 1712, 52 years after his death. The written account of an eye witness states that "...(t)he eyes and nose alone showed some decay." However, when the body was exhumed again during the canonization in 1737 it was then discovered to have decomposed due to an underground flood. His bones have been encased in a waxen figure which is displayed in a glass reliquary in the chapel of the headquarters of the Vincentian fathers in Paris. His heart is still incorrupt, and is displayed in a reliquary in the chapel of the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity in Paris.The Incorruptibles, Joan Carroll Cruz, Tan Books and Publishers, Inc., 1977, pp. 248-9.In 1737, his feast day was included in the Roman Calendar on 19 July, because his day of death was already used for the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian. It was originally to be celebrated with the rank of "Double", which was changed to the equivalent rank of "Third-Class Feast" in 1960.General Roman Calendar of 1962In the Novus Ordo calendar, he is remembered with a memorial on 27 September, Cosmas and Damian having been moved to 26 September to make way for him, as he is now better known in the West.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 140DePaul University takes its name from Vincent de Paul.References See alsoSaint Vincent CollegeSociety of Saint Vincent de PaulVincentian FamilyVincentian Studies InstituteExternal linksThe life of St. Vincent de Paul (1856)Founder Statue in St Peter's BasilicaCategory:1581 births Category:1660 deaths Category:Founders of Roman Catholic religious communities Category:French saintsde:Vinzenz von Paul es:Vicente de Paúl fr:Vincent de Paul hr:Vinko Paulski it:Vincenzo de' Paoli he:וינסנט דה פול la:Vincentius a Paulo ln:Vincent wa Paul nl:Vincentius a Paulo pl:Wincenty à Paulo pt:Vicente de Paulo ru:Поль, Винсент де sk:Vincent de Paul fi:Vincent de Paul sv:Vincent de Paul vi:Vinh Sơn Phaolô
