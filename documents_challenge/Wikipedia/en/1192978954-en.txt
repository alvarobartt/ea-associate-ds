 Daredevil is a fictional character that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964) and was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount of input from Jack Kirby, Comics historian and former Jack Kirby assistant Mark Evanier, investigating claims of Kirby's involvement in the creation of both Iron Man and Daredevil, interviewed Kirby and Everett on the subject, years before their deaths. In his column P.O.V. Online: The Jack FAQ: &quot;What did Jack do on the first stories of Iron Man and Daredevil?&quot;, he concluded that, "in both cases, Jack had already drawn the covers of those issues and done some amount of design work. He ... seems to have participated in the design of Daredevil's first costume. ... Everett did tell me that Jack had come up with the idea of Daredevil's billy club. ... Jack, in effect, drew the first page of that first Daredevil story. In the rush to get that seriously late book to press, there wasn't time to complete Page One, so Stan had manager Sol Brodsky slap together a paste-up that employed Kirby's cover drawing. ... Everett volunteered to me that Jack had "helped him" though he wouldn't — or more likely, couldn't — elaborate on that. He just plain didn't remember it well, and in later years apparently gave others who asked a wide range of answers".Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada later noted in his Newsarama column &quot;Joe Fridays Week 4&quot; (2005, no other date given) that when Everett turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Brodsky and Spider-Man artist Steve Ditko inked "a lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly and cobbled the cover and the splash page together from Kirby's original concept drawing". Daredevil is notable as being among the few superheroes with a disability, being blinded as a youth in a radioactive accident that also drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a "radar-sense" allowing him to perceive his surroundings. His public identity is Matt Murdock, a successful attorney-at-law.Although Daredevil had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists — Everett, Kirby, Wally Wood, John Romita, Sr., and Gene Colan, among others — it is Frank Miller's influential tenure on the title in the late 1970s and early 1980s that is best remembered, cementing the character as a popular and influential part of the Marvel Universe. Daredevil has also been adapted into various other media including a live-action film released in 2003, in which he was portrayed by Ben Affleck.Publication historyVolume 1: 1964 - 1998Daredevil's original costume was a combination of black, yellow and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights, and went through minor revisions in issues #2 through #4 by EC Comics artist Joe Orlando. Fellow acclaimed EC veteran Wally Wood penciled #5-8, introducing the modern, completely red costume in issue #7. Golden Age great Bob Powell (Sheena, Queen of the Jungle) penciled two issues over Wood layouts, and they then swapped for #11, which Wood inked over Powell's pencils. [[Image:Daredevilv1issue1splashpage.png|thumb|left|Daredevil's first costume, from Daredevil #1 (April 1964). Splash-page art by Jack Kirby (penciler) and Bill Everett (inker)..]] Issue #12 began a brief run by Jack Kirby (layouts) and John Romita, Sr. It was Romita's return to superhero penciling after a decade of working exclusively as a romance-comic artist for DC. Romita had felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker.Romita, from Comic Book Artist #6 (Fall 1999) http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06romita.html: "I had inked an Avengers job for Stan, and I told him I just wanted to ink. I felt like I was burned out as a penciller after eight years of romance work. I didn't want to pencil any more; in fact, I couldn't work at home any more — I couldn't discipline myself to do it. He said, 'Okay,' but the first chance he had he shows me this Daredevil story somebody had started and he didn't like it, and he wanted somebody else to do it." Elaborating in Alter Ego #9 (July 2001) http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/09romita.html, he added, "Stan showed me Dick Ayers' splash page for a Daredevil. He asked me, "What would you do with this page?" I showed him on a tracing paper what I would do, and then he asked me to do a drawing of Daredevil the way I would do it. I did a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it."When Romita left to take over The Amazing Spider-Man, Lee gave Daredevil to the character's first signature artist, Gene Colan, who began with issue #20 (Sept. 1966). Colan pencilled all but three issues through #100 (June 1973), plus the 1967 annual, followed by ten issues sprinkled from 1974-79. (He would return again, an established legend, for an eight-issue run in 1997). Among the notable plot developments during this period were Matt Murdock's panicky creation of a "twin brother", the "sighted" and devil-may-care Mike Murdock, in #25 (Feb. 1967), whom Karen Page and Foggy Nelson are led to believe is Daredevil; "Mike's" death in #41 (June 1968); and Matt revealing his Daredevil identity to Karen Page in #57 (Oct. 1969).Much like in The Amazing Spider-Man — and in what was already an established hallmark of Marvel Comics storytelling — interpersonal drama was as central to the series as action and adventure. A triangle of unrequited love develops between Foggy Nelson, Karen Page and Murdock, with Nelson unable to win over Page and Matt unable to admit that Page loves anyone other than Daredevil. When the revelation of Murdock's dual identity proves too much for Page, she leaves the firm and the comic.In the 1970s the title featured a double billing, co-starring Daredevil's girlfriend, the Black Widow. During this time, the series' writers included Gerry Conway, Steve Gerber and Chris Claremont. Artists included Bob Brown and Don Heck.  and Klaus Janson.]]The modern definition of Daredevil began in 1979 with Frank Miller's entrance on the title. Miller's first contributions were as an artist, where he imbued a new dynamism and a dramatically different visual style. The series' tone became that of noir with Hell's Kitchen itself playing a more prominent role.With issue #168, Miller additionally became the series' writer, and the comic underwent a drastic metamorphosis. The most significant change was the introduction of Spider-Man villain Kingpin as Daredevil's new arch-nemesis. Until that point, Daredevil's enemies were primarily, though not exclusively, costumed villains. The Kingpin was a departure in that although he possessed extraordinary size, strength and fighting ability, his villainy came from his ruthless brilliance in running a criminal empire, rather than superpowers. The title still retained costumed antagonists — notably Bullseye and Elektra — but found its central theme to be one more grounded in reality: organized crime.Miller also introduced ninjas into the Daredevil canon, bringing a greater focus on the martial arts aspect of Daredevil's fighting skills, and introducing the characters Stick and the Hand. This was a drastic change to a character once considered a swashbuckler. The focus of a ninja's control of the inner self served as a counterbalance to the emerging themes of anger and torment.Comics-artist legend Wally Wood, following kidney failure and the loss of vision in one eye, returned to the character he helped define, inking Miller's cover of Daredevil #164 (May 1980). It was one of Wood's final assignments before his death in 1981.Miller's noir take on the character continued, even after he left (in 1983, after issue #191). However, successor Dennis O'Neil did not find the commercial success of his predecessor. In late 1985, Miller returned to the series, co-writing #226 with O'Neil, then writing the acclaimed "Daredevil: Born Again" storyline in #227-233 (Feb.-Aug. 1986), with artist David Mazzuchelli.A round-robin of creators contributed in the year that followed Born Again: writers Mark Gruenwald, Danny Fingeroth, Steve Englehart (under the pseudonym "John Harkness") and Ann Nocenti, and pencilers Steve Ditko, Barry Windsor-Smith, Louis Williams, Sal Buscema, Todd McFarlane, Keith Pollard,and Chuck Patton. Longshot co-creator Nocenti, who'd written #236, became the regular writer for a four-and-a-quarter year run of all but two issues from #238-291 (Jan. 1987 - April 1991). John Romita, Jr. joined as penciller from #250-282 (Jan. 1988 - Jul. 1990), and was generally inked by Al Williamson. The team specifically addressed societal issues, with Murdock, now running a non-profit urban legal center, confronting sexism, racism, and nuclear proliferation while fighting supervillains. Nocenti introduced the popular antagonist Typhoid Mary in issue #254.Under writers Karl Kesel and later Joe Kelly, the book gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and Foggy (who now knows of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe.Volume 2 . Promotional art for Daredevil Visionaries: Kevin Smith by Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti.]] In 1998, Daredevil's numbering was rebooted, with the title "canceled" and revived a month later as part of the Marvel Knights imprint. Joe Quesada drew the new series, written by filmmaker Kevin Smith. Its first eight-issue story arc, "Guardian Devil" depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the Messiah or the Anti-Christ. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has AIDS (later revealed to be a hoax), and her subsequent death at Bullseye's hands.After "Guardian Devil", Smith was succeeded by writer-artist David Mack, who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole" (#9-15). This arc introduces Maya Lopez, also known as Echo, a deaf martial artist. Mack brought independent-comics colleague Brian Michael Bendis to Marvel for the following arc, "Wake Up" (#16-19), which follows reporter Ben Urich as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and an obscure old villain called Leapfrog. Following Mack and Bendis were Back to the Future screenwriter Bob Gale and artists Phil Winslade and David Ross for the story "Playing to the Camera". Mack continued to contribute covers.Issue #26 (Dec. 2001) brought back Brian Michael Bendis, working this time with artist Alex Maleev, for a four-year-run that became one of the series' most acclaimed. Maleev's harsh and grainy look is in contrast to Quesada's more cartoony lines, and distinctively reads like a marriage of Frank Miller's film noir style and the pulp-magazine art of the 1920s and '30s. Developments in this run included the introduction of Milla Donovan, the outing of Murdock's secret identity to the press, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI. Writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark became the new creative team with Daredevil #82 (Feb. 2006), no longer under the Marvel Knights imprint.Fictional character biography(pencils) and George Klein (inks).]] Irish-American Matthew Murdock is raised by single father and fading boxer "Battling Jack" Murdock after his mother, presumably a nun named Maggie, left both Jack and Matthew in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. He was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and non-violence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. Though Jack's intentions are noble, Matt is left unprepared to handle the bullying he received at school, and is branded with the sarcastic nickname, "Daredevil". Matt vents his frustration and anger by training in secret.In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from the vehicle. Though the act of heroism robs him of sight, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human thresholds, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him.Daredevil #1 A mysterious man, Stick, becomes his mentor, and teaches him to control his new abilities while honing his natural aptitude in acrobatics and martial arts. Stick, also blind, teaches Matt how to form a mental image of the objects around him, and Matt develops a "radar sense" to make up for his sight. Still in school, Matt continues to honor his father's wishes by excelling in his studies, and ultimately enrolls in the Columbia School of Law.Back in Hell's Kitchen, Jack struggles and becomes an enforcer for small-time crook and boxing manager, the Fixer. In exchange for his services, the Fixer rigs a series of matches and provides "Battling Jack" a late-life boxing renaissance, resulting in the once near-destitute fighter becoming a title contender. On the night of the title fight against "Crusher" Creel, the future Absorbing Man, with his son in the crowd, Jack ignores the Fixer's demands to take a dive and wins by knockout. For his disobedience, the Fixer has him murdered.In college, Matt meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios, the daughter of a Greek diplomat. When Elektra and her father are kidnapped by terrorists, Matt dons a mask for the first time and fights to save the two. In the mayhem that follows, Elektra's father is accidentally shot and killed by a SWAT team member. Overcome with grief, Elektra breaks Murdock's heart by leaving America behind and returning to the study of martial arts.Matt is devastated by the loss of his father and the judicial system's failure to convict the men responsible. Mindful of the childhood promise he made to his father not to lead a violent life, Matt dons a new identity for providing justice. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes, renamed with the moniker of his childhood derision, and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers and avenges his father as the superhero Daredevil.Daredevil: Yellow is an epistolary take on the origin story, using letters written to Karen Page after her death. Here Page believes she is in love with both Daredevil and Murdock, and Nelson with Karen Page, resulting in a silent rivalry between the two men. The supervillains the Owl and the Purple Man are the antagonists. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase "The Man without Fear", and she also suggest to Daredevil he wear red instead of black and yellow.Superhero[[Image:DDY3cover lg.jpg|thumb|left|Cover art for Daredevil: Yellow #3, by Tim Sale: Murdock and Nelson founding their firm.]] After establishing his law firm with his best friend and college roommate Franklin &quot;Foggy&quot; Nelson and secretary Karen Page, Daredevil embarks on a series of colorful adventures involving such villains as the Owl, Stilt-Man, the Gladiator, and the Enforcers. Daredevil's early exploits were often large, swashbuckling adventures, and sub-plots involved romantic triangles between Matt, Karen and Foggy and cases of mistaken identity. He also meets Spider-Man during this time.Daredevil #16Daredevil moves to San Francisco for a time to live with the spy and super-heroine the Black Widow, and enters into a romantic relationship with herDaredevil #81 but she soon ends the relationship, fearing that playing "sidekick" to Daredevil is sublimating her identity.Daredevil #124 Murdock returns to Hell's Kitchen.

The Kingpin uses this information to destroy Murdock piece by piece: blowing up his house, ruining his reputation as a lawyer, getting him disbarred, menacing his personal life and nearly driving him insane.Daredevil #227 Matt suffers a nervous breakdown.Daredevil #228-230 Miller ends the story on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with Karen Page as his sometime lover,Daredevil #231 and the mother he thought dead, now a nun, and resuming a less complicated life in Hell's Kitchen. Daredevil then allies with Captain America against the deluded government super-soldier, Nuke.Daredevil #233 Daredevil is also attacked by Ultron, who was acting on Dr. Doom's orders.

Forced to fake his own death and change his uniform to an armored "razor costume", Murdock undergoes one of his numerous breakdowns. The change does not last, and Daredevil soon returns to his traditional red costume, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a deus ex machina doppelgänger).Daredevil encounters the supervillain Mysterio, who is dying of cancer from overexposure to his primary weapon, a mist. Mysterio orchestrates events so that Daredevil is convinced he is involved in the saving of a reborn baby Jesus, leading to a battle between Daredevil and Bullseye that ends with the death of Karen Page.Daredevil vol. 2, #8 (June 1999)Identity revealed and eventual BreakdownAmbitious mobster Sammy Silke orchestrates a coup against the Kingpin, leading to violent revenge by Vanessa Fisk, the Kingpin’s wife. Silke, in exchange for protection, gives Daredevil's identity to the FBI, which makes it public in the Daily Globe. Murdock is subsequently subjected to a short lived but intense media coverage and scrutiny. Murdock responds by vigorous denials and a libel lawsuit against the newspaper. While the world ponders whether the respected attorney has made a mockery of the justice system with many past trials involving Daredevil, potentially making Murdock guilty of obstruction of Justice, he hires Luke Cage and Jessica Jones as bodyguards. In other developments, client Hector Ayala, the superhero White Tiger, is shot and killed by police after Murdock loses a manslaughter case in which Ayala was innocent.Daredevil vol. 2, #26-37, (Dec. 2001 - Nov. 2002) During this period, Daredevil was invited to join the New Avengers after aiding the team in stopping a riot at supervillain prison the Raft, but refused the offer because he didn't want to affect their reputations in the public eyeNew Avengers #3, although he did suggest his ex-girlfriend Echo as an alternative member when they required someone with in-depth knowledge on the Hand and Wolverine was otherwise occupied.New Avengers #11Murdock meets and romances the blind Milla Donovan, and battles efforts by the Owl to take Fisk's place as Kingpin by marketing the drug MGH (Mutant Growth Hormone). Daredevil discovers that the Kingpin, thought dead, has recovered from the coup's attempt on his life and after a violent confrontation that sends his nemesis to the hospital, Daredevil declares himself the kingpin of Hell's Kitchen.Daredevil vol. 2 #46-50 (June-Oct. 2003)A year later, the increasingly violent and antisocial Daredevil has married Donovan and also won his case against the Daily Globe, resulting in a multimillion dollar settlement he reinvests into the community. His reporter friend Ben Urich suggests he's suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by unresolved feelings over the death of Karen Page. Donovan, in response, annuls the marriage.Iron Fist as Daredevil.|frame]] Imprisoned by the FBI through the machinations of the Kingpin, Murdock cannot stop the apparent murder of Foggy Nelson at Ryker's, while a mysterious new Daredevil appears in Hell's Kitchen.Daredevil vol. 2, #87 (Sept. 2006) Murdock escapes with the Punisher during a prison riot and discovers the ersatz Daredevil to be his friend, Hero for Hire Danny Rand, the superhero Iron Fist.

Matt reunites with Foggy and Milla in New York, and feels obliged to have the Kingpin's charges dropped. The Kingpin's U.S. citizenship is revoked, and he is forced to leave the country. While Murdock is away, Rand, filling-in as Daredevil during the events of the Superhero Registration "Civil War", is captured and imprisoned for not registering.Civil War #5. Rand would later escape and join The Secret Avengers in the final battle.Civil War #6.Murdock back in Hell's KitchenOnce again, supervillains intend to fill the void in the criminal empire left by the Kingpin. Firstly, Larry Cranston resurfaces as Mister Fear, with the Enforcers at his side, providing the criminals of Hell's Kitchen a drug that causes the user to become psychotic and completely unafraid of death. In an attempt to make Daredevil's life miserable, Cranston also gives the drug to Milla Donovan, Murdock's ex-wife with whom he has reconciled. Daredevil has also come into conflict with the crime empire of The Hood.Daredevil vol. 2 #95-103 (May 2007- January 2008)Powers, abilities, and equipmentAlthough Daredevil is blind, the exposure to chemical radiation that cost him of his sight has enhanced his four remaining senses to function with high levels of superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person.Daredevil's sense of hearing allows him to detect sounds ordinary humans can't, such as detecting the steady rhythm of a person's normal heartbeat several feet away, and sounds that normal humans can hear but at much greater distances. His hearing can detect the subtle changes in a person's respiration and heartbeat during a lie, which serves as a type of lie detector. A drawback to such enhanced hearing is his sensitivity to loud noises, which can be detrimental at times.Daredevil's sense of touch is sensitive enough to feel the impressions of ink on paper, enabling him to read by touch. He can detect minuscule changes in pressure and temperature. This sensitivity to heat allows him to sense the temperature of other beings or objects, which he often uses to determine whether a person is alive or dead. A side effect of his sense of touch is Daredevil's ability to manipulate his muscles and internal organs.His sense of smell is sufficiently enhanced to distinguish an individual by his or her natural scent. He can use this sense of smell to track someone over great distances or through large crowds with a high degree of success. His sense of taste is similarly enhanced, allowing him to minutely detect the every ingredient of whatever he consumes. For instance, he can detect the number of grains of salt present on a pretzel.Although he's blind, Daredevil can "see" by means of a type of "radar sense" that allows him to sense the proximity of people and objects around him. Daredevil's radar sense is connected with his hearing, as the bouncing of sounds and vibrations off his surroundings enable him to "see" what's happening around him. It also allows him to trace the trajectory of a projective weapon sufficiently to dodge it with relative ease, if he's far enough away from it. He also uses his radar sense in much the same way during hand to hand combat, with the sounds allowing him to "see" in order to block or effectively launch an attack.Through years of training and practice, Daredevil has developed tremendous concentration that allows him to sift through the vast amount of sensory input to any one specific stimulus to the extend that he's able to exclude all the others. Otherwise, something as simple as being able to fall asleep would be practically impossible.Though he has no superhuman physical attributes, Daredevil has great natural strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He has shown himself to be a surperb gymnast with abilities that are superior to that of a highly skilled Olympic level gymnast that can see, due to the heightened sense of balance his superhuman hearing affords him. Daredevil's training by Stick has made him into a formidable hand to hand combatant. He typically blends the martial arts of Ninjutsu, Jujutsu, and Judo with American style Boxing. His great natural agility to create a unique fighting style that allows him to make full use of his gymnastics capabilities.Daredevil's signature weapon is his specially designed billy club, which he created. Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a versatile, multi-purpose weapon that contains thirty feet of aircraft control cable connected to a case-hardened steel grapnel. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the grapnel. The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can also be split into two parts, one of which is a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook. Daredevil has extreme accuracy when throwing his club, and can hit multiple enemies with ricochets.As Matt Murdock, Daredevil is also a highly skilled criminal defense attorney with an extensive knowledge of the American legal system, even going so far as to defend some of his former adversaries in court.CharactersLove interests.
