He play as left/right back, But he can also play as centre back.Club careerTorres played his whole career for Real Madrid and its junior teams since he was 12. On 12 July 2007, he signed his first professional contract for the first team until 2013, joining the first team permanently from Real Madrid Castilla.Torres made his senior debut against Écija Balompié as a starter in a Spanish Cup contest on October 25 2006, because of injuries to first team defenders Fabio Cannavaro, Cicinho and Míchel Salgado. He also played in the return leg as a substitute, replacing Sergio Ramos in the 80th minute. He would also start in both cup matches against Real Betis, sporting jersey #38 in these games and throughout the season.He then made his league debut in his fourth consecutive appearance for Real Madrid, playing the whole 90 minutes against Real Zaragoza. He kept his place in the side the following week for the game against Real Mallorca, with that performance leading then-coach Fabio Capello to state:"It is not easy to find a player with as much personality and talent in attack and defence as Torres".On February 10, 2007, in the match against Real Sociedad, Torres made his first assist. After a quick run on the left flank he provided a great left-footed (he is right-footed by nature) cross for Ruud van Nistelrooy, whose header found the net, as Madrid came from behind to win in away 2-1.With Torres as an important piece (debuting in round 18, he only missed three contests until the end of the season, starting in all but one), R.Madrid won its 30th league title. However, he was unable to play in the deciding game against Mallorca due to a hamstring tear.Although Torres appeared in more league games in the following season, he would start significantly less (as Madrid repeated league honours), primarily due to the signing of Argentine Gabriel Heinze. In that season, he switched back to number 22, which he previously wore with Castilla.International careerTorres debuted for the Spain U-21 team on February 6 2007, in a 2-2 draw against England. He has been a regular starter ever since.Club career statistics(correct as of 18 May, 2008)ClubSeasonLeagueCupEuropeTotalAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsReal Madrid Castilla2006-0714010000001401Total1401Real Madrid2006-07180250030026022007–0820003003002600Total5202Career Total6603HonoursReal MadridDomesticSpanish League: 2006-07, 2007-08Spanish Super Cup: 2008, runner-up 2007External linksStats at Liga de Fútbol Profesional Unofficial fansite   Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish footballers Category:La Liga footballers Category:Real Madrid C.F. players Category:Real Madrid C footballers Category:Football (soccer) defendersar:ميغيل توريس ca:Miguel Torres de:Miguel Torres es:Miguel Torres Gómez fr:Miguel Torres ko:미겔 토레스 고메스 it:Miguel Torres Gómez nl:Miguel Torres ja:ミゲル・トーレス pl:Miguel Torres fi:Miguel Torres sv:Miguel Torres Gómez zh:米基爾·托利斯
