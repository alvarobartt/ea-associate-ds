The township of Henderson emerged in the 1940s to supply the country with magnesium, the "miracle metal" of World War II.http://www.scribd.com/doc/2097157/194406DesertMagazine1944June?page=10 Although "born in America's defense," Henderson's future after the war was uncertain until April 16, 1953 when city incorporation papers were signed. The PEPCON disaster took place on May 4, 1988 near the town.Henderson was "born in America's defense" ten years prior to its incorporation during World War II with the building of the Basic Magnesium Plant. The plant supplied the US War Department with magnesium for incendiary munition casings and airplane engines, frames, and other parts. Mayor Jim Gibson's father, Fred Gibson, was one of the original engineers sent to Great Britain to learn the secret of creating the "miracle metal" which would eventually help the United States and the allies win the war. However, in 1947, magnesium production was no longer necessary for defense and most of the 14,000 BMI employees moved away. Enrollment in the school system was reduced by two thirds and well over half the townsite houses, built to house plant workers, went vacant. In 1947 the United States War Asset Administration actually offered Henderson for sale as war surplus property.In an effort to save the city, the Nevada Legislature spent a weekend visiting Henderson evaluating the possibility of state administration of Basic Magnesium. Within days of the visit, the legislators unanimously approved a bill giving the Colorado River Commission of Nevada the authority to purchase the industrial plants. Governor Vail Pittman signed the Bill on March 27, 1947, helping save Henderson from becoming war surplus property.With the help of local industry, the City of Henderson, Nevada, was officially incorporated on April 16, 1953. On May 23, 1953, Henderson, with its population of 7,410, elected Dr. Jim French as the town's first Mayor. Originally about 13 square miles in size, the City quickly began to grow and flourish. Today, the City of Henderson has grown to 94 square miles and is the second largest city in Nevada. The city's official slogan "Henderson—a Place to Call Home" reflects a community that enjoys small town values while benefiting from big city efficiencies.An increasing number of major shopping malls, movie theater complexes, restaurants and casino resorts offer residents a variety of choices for leisure time in Henderson. The city also borders Las Vegas and is not too far from the world-famous Las Vegas Strip. "Shakespeare in the Park" celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1996, a testament to Henderson's long standing support for the arts and cultural programs. The City also boasts the largest recreational facility – the Multigenerational Facility at Liberty Pointe – in Nevada as well as Nevada's only scenic Bird Preserve. The city supports a variety of other cultural events as well, many of which are held at the outdoor amphitheater, the largest one of its kind in Nevada.Henderson is located just a few miles from McCarran International Airport; and Henderson Executive Airport, recently acquired by Clark County, is planned for major renovation and development as a reliever airport to McCarran.Master-planned residential areas include Anthem, Anthem Country Club, Black Mountain Vistas, Calico Ridge, Champion Village, Green Valley, Green Valley Ranch, Inspirada, Lake Las Vegas, MacDonald Highlands, MacDonald Ranch, Madeira Canyon , Seven Hills, Sun City Anthem, Sun City MacDonald Ranch, Tuscany Residential Village, and Whitney Ranch.http://www.mslasvegasrealestate.com/henderson.htmlRocket Fuel Factory Fire In 1988, the PEPCON rocket fuel factory became engulfed in fire.

There are no signs of the Pepcon explosion today, and the site now consists mostly of office buildings.Best Place to LiveIn 2006, Money magazine ranked Henderson 20th in its annual list of the top 100 places to live in the U.S.MONEY Magazine: Best places to live 2006: Henderson, NV snapshot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;One of the Most Walkable CitiesPrevention magazine tapped Henderson in 2007 as the sixth best walking city in America ahead of San Diego, California and just behind Seattle, WashingtonTop 100 Best Walker-Friendly Cities - Prevention.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.
