He is of partly Spanish-Catalan descent.France manager2006 World CupOn July 12, 2004, Domenech was a surprise choice to succeed Jacques Santini after the country's disappointing exit from Euro 2004 by losing in the quarter-final match to the eventual tournament winners Greece. He was given the objective by the Fédération Française de Football to reach "at least" the 2006 FIFA World Cup semi-finals.QualifyingFrance struggled in the qualifiers, even though the team was seeded in a group that included the relatively unheralded teams of Israel and Switzerland The Republic of Ireland were France's main contenders in the group, and looked like contributing to France's exit until Zidane returned to inspire France to a 1-0 win at landsdowne road, inspiring the French and ending the hopes of the Irish. Domenech had to force Claude Makélélé, Lilian Thuram and Zinédine Zidane, members of France's 'golden generation', out of international retirement to aid the national team to eventually qualify. The general consensus in France, however, was that France was too dated a side to win the 2006 FIFA World Cup, despite the return of their cherished talisman, Zidane.Squad selectionDomenech's management style has also raised eyebrows amongst players and fans. A keen amateur dramatist and astrologer, Domenech has admitted to distrusting Scorpios, such as Robert Pirès. This led to the choosing of Vikash Dhorasoo who played an important part in qualifying but not in the finals. He later fell out with Dhorasoo after he made a behind the scenes film called "Substitute". His decision to leave out FC Barcelona star Ludovic Giuly in favour of Franck Ribéry, and subsequent refusal to explain that decision, left many French players and fans mystified.&lt;/ref&gt; Domenech chose Pascal Chimbonda, a low-profile player with no face or international experience, for the squad. Domenech's selection for the France's World Cup squad was further criticised when he publicly announced that Fabien Barthez would start ahead of Lyon goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. This decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet walking out of the national squad before the tournament, though he was later to return. &lt;/ref&gt; His exclusion of A.S. Roma back bone defender, Philippe Mexès, has also raised a few eyebrows. Mexès, named Hope of the year in 2000 and being an all star defender for Roma since his arrival to the team, still has to participate in a competitive senior tournament under Domenech.Finals in GermanyHis tactical strategies, perceived as "naïve" amongst the French press &lt;/ref&gt; and his team's slow start in the 2006 FIFA World Cup (recording ties against Switzerland and South Korea before finally defeating Togo) had seen him placed under further pressure.However, France turned the corner after the victory against Togo and started to play the good passing possession football in which they were renowned for in their triumphs in World Cup 98 and Euro 2000. They shone in the knockout round, which included impressive victories over favoured Spain, Brazil, and Portugal. France lost the final to Italy in the penalty shootout after a 1&ndash;1 tie in extra time.France's successful tournament caused the pressure on Domenech to be lifted completely. Recalled golden generation veterans Zidane and Thuram earned spots on the All-Star Team, with Zidane being named the tournament MVP. Ribéry's performance made him the potent successor to Zidane as the team's talisman.Euro 2008 On August 27, 2007, Claude Makélélé's club manager, José Mourinho, stated that Domenech was treating Makélélé "like a slave," since Domenech had called him up for Euro 2008 qualifiers even though Makélélé had announced his retirement after the 2006 World Cup. Domenech responded, "As long as he is performing, he will play. I have the right to pick him." http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060827/sp_soccer_afp/fblengprblackburn_060827220344 A 3&ndash;0 shutout of Georgia and a 3&ndash;1 defeat of Italy in the first Euro 2008 qualifiers took France back to the top of the ELO rankings. Despite losing to Scotland twice, France qualified for Euro 2008 as runners-up to Italy. Domenech criticised the seeding system for the Euro 2008 group stage draw, which allowed for the possibility that France could be drawn into the same group as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania, a so-called group of death.France were eliminated in the group stage with only a single point from a goalless draw with Romania. Domenech had earlier said that he would quit as coach if he failed to qualify for the quarterfinals. Makélélé, who had participated in the tournament, again announced his international retirement shortly thereafter.During the aftermath press conference of France's humiliating elimination from the group stages of Euro 2008, Domenech made an eccentric marriage proposal to his companion. The timing of this proposal was considered very inappropriate, and Domenech was criticized by the French media.Although it was expected that he would lose his position, in July 2008 it was announced Domenech had retained his job.Career1969-1977: played for Olympique Lyonnais.
