She achieved her career-high rank of #16 on September 29, 2008. She is the only Danish woman currently in the Top 450 on the WTA Tour, and more importantly the Top 20.  Private lifeWozniacki is the daughter of Polish parents (her father Piotr, and her mother Anna).

Her mother played on the Polish national volleyball team. Her father played football professionally in Germany, and they moved to Denmark when he was sold to a Danish club. Her older brother Patrick Wozniacki is a professional football player, playing for BK Frem in Copenhagen.Playing styleHer game is characterized by solid baseline play with few net approaches and few unforced errors. When under pressure she often returns high and slow, giving her time to get back in position. Her best shot is her two-handed backhand down the line. She is strong mentally and plays well on big points. Her relative weak points are a lack of snap in her forehand and a tendency to sometimes be a bit too defensive, waiting for the opponent to fail instead of hitting outright winners. Her serve is solid if not among the hardest on the tour. Her volleys need a little more work, though not a major drawback with her style of play.CareerShe has won several junior tournaments (including the 2006 Wimbledon girls' singles tournament and the 2005 Orange Bowl tennis championship), and made her debut on the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour at Cincinnati's Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Women's Open on July 19, 2005, losing to the top-seeded and later champion Patty Schnyder in the first round.2006In 2006, she was the first seed at the Australian Open (junior girl's singles), but lost the final to eight-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia, with the score 6–1, 2–6, 3–6.
