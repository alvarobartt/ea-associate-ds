The Attalid dynasty was a Hellenistic dynasty that ruled the city of Pergamon after the death of Lysimachus, a general of Alexander the Great. The Attalid kingdom was the rump state left after the collapse of the Lysimachian Empire. One of Lysimachus' officers, Philetaerus, took control of the city in 282 BC. The later Attalids were descended from his father, and they expanded the city into a kingdom. Attalus I proclaimed himself King in the 230s BC, following his victories over the Galatians. The Attalids ruled Pergamon until Attalus III bequeathed the kingdom to the Roman Republic in 133 BC to avoid a likely succession crisis.On the interior of the Pergamon Altar is a frieze depicting the life of Telephos, son of Herakles, whom the ruling Attalid dynasty associated with their city and utilized to claim descendance from the Olympians. Pergamon, having entered the Greek world much later than their counterparts to the west, could not boast the same divine heritage as older city-states, and had to retroactively cultivate their place in Greek mythos.Dynasty of PergamumPhiletaerus (282 BC&ndash;263 BC)Eumenes I (263 BC&ndash;241 BC)Attalus I Soter (241 BC&ndash;197 BC)Eumenes II (197 BC&ndash;159 BC)Attalus II Philadelphus (160 BC&ndash;138 BC)Attalus III (138 BC&ndash;133 BC)Eumenes III Aristonicus (pretender, 133 BC&ndash;129 BC)Genealogy            ReferencesHansen, Esther V.
