 MeshName     = Eyebrows |The eyebrow is an area of thick, delicate hairs above the eye that follows the shape of the brow ridges.FunctionThe main function of the eyebrow is to prevent moisture, mostly salty sweat and rain, from flowing into the eye, an organ critical to sight. The typical curved shape of the eyebrow (with a slant on the side) and the direction in which eyebrow hairs are pointed, make sure that moisture has a tendency to flow sideways around the eyes, along the side of the head and along the nose. The slightly protruding brow ridges of modern humans could also still play a supporting role in this process. Together with the eyebrows, the brow ridges also shade the eyes from sunlight.Eyebrows also prevent debris such as dandruff and other small objects from falling into the eyes, as well as providing a more sensitive sense for detecting objects being near the eye, like small insects. Eyebrows protects eyes from damage.Eyebrows also have an important facilitative function in communication, strengthening expressions like surprise or anger.Eyebrow modificationSome people use tweezers or waxing to shape their eyebrows. Threading eyebrows has also become a popular method, because it does not pull at the skin. All of these methods can be painful for some seconds or minutes due to the sensitivity of the area around the eye, but, often, this pain decreases over time as the individual becomes used to the sensation. In the era of the metrosexual it has become more common for men to pluck their eyebrows to appear more youthful and attractive.There are some who completely wax or shave off their entire eyebrows, then, either leave them bare, or draw them in with eye liner. Entirely shaved eyebrows will grow back in approximately 1 week.==See also==Eyebrow piercingTrichotillomaniaUnibrowCategory:facial hair Category:Eye Category:facial features ay:Nayra chiphu bs:Obrva de:Augenbraue es:Ceja eu:Bekain fa:ابرو fr:Sourcils id:Alis mata iu:ᖃᓪᓗ/qallu he:גבה pam:Kile nl:Wenkbrauw ja:眉毛 pag:Kirep pl:Brew pt:Sobrancelha sq:Vetulla simple:Eyebrow fi:Kulmakarvat sv:Ögonbryn tl:Kilay tr:Kaşlar yi:ברעמען diq:Buri zh:眉毛
