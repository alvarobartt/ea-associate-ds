Erik III Håkonssøn Lam (probably born around 1100-1105 on Funen (Fyn), died August 27, 1146 in Odense) was the king of Denmark from 1137 until he abdicated in 1146. He was the grandson of Eric I of Denmark.Being the nephew of Eric II he succeeded to the throne after the latter’s murder. In general his rule was a peaceful one, however for some years he had to fight against his cousin Oluf, sometimes called Oluf II (or Olaf II) who made himself a base of power in Scania in 1139 and from there tried to conquer the throne until he was defeated and killed 1141 near Helsingborg.Erik III is the first Danish king who seems to have been strongly influenced by German culture. He had spent his early youth among German knights whose ideals marked most of his later life. Also his queen, Lutgard of Salzwedel, was a German.Contemporary chroniclers highly disagree about the personality of this king who is sometimes portrayed as a passive and irresolute man, sometimes as an eager and brave fighter. His nickname “Lam” means "lamb", as in “weak” or “meek”, not "lame" as in "infirm".Denmark seems to have been a stable country during his kingship, however, and some contemporary sources speak very highly of him. The reasons for his abdication (the only one by a Danish king) are unknown; he entered a convent and died the same year, and the illness which killed him may well have been the main reason.
