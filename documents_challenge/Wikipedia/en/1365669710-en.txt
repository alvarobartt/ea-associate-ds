As their most commercially successful pop album, it got generally favourable reviews from critics and produced five US Top 5 singles, including the title track which reached the pole position.The album was structured to appeal to both newer and older Genesis fans, with radio-friendly singles like "Land of Confusion" and the title track for pop fans, and longer tracks like "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight" and "Domino" aimed more towards fans of the band's progressive rock style of the 1970s. The idiosyncratic instrumental "The Brazilian" showed the band had not lost its willingness to experiment.A SACD and DVD double disc set (including new 5.1 and Stereo mixes) was released in October 2007.LyricsSome of the lyrics on this album are among Genesis' rare attempts at social and political commentary, with "Domino" evoking a nightmarish nuclear war scenario and "Land of Confusion" commenting satirically on the political turmoil of the Reagan/Thatcher/Gorbachev era. A widely acclaimed video for "Land of Confusion", featuring the Spitting Image puppets, was nominated for MTV's Video of the Year Award, but ironically, lost to former lead singer Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer. "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight", another hit song from the album, dealt with drug addiction, while "Anything She Does" took a humorous yet subtle look at pornography.ReceptionCatching Genesis at their commercial peak, Invisible Touch was an instant UK #1, while it reached #3 in the US and went six times platinum there. The album was supported by the 1986-87 Invisible Touch Tour, a concert video of which was released in 1988 and on DVD in 2003.Cut songsThree songs were cut from the album and subsequently released as B-sides: "Feeding the Fire" (on "Land of Confusion"), "I'd Rather Be You" (on "Throwing It All Away"), and "Do the Neurotic" (on "In Too Deep"). Both "Feeding the Fire" and "Do the Neurotic" were written by Tony Banks, while "I'd Rather Be You" was written by Phil Collins. In interviews promoting Invisible Touch, both Tony and Phil stated that they felt that there may have been enough room on the album for these tracks, but they had to pick and choose which songs they felt to be a better fit to the overall sound of the album.Song creationDuring the writing process, "Invisible Touch", produced through improvisation, became a stand-alone piece. It was originally conceived by Tony Banks as a part of the "Domino" suite. Phil began singing over the keyboard parts that Tony had written and "Invisible Touch" became a separate song entirely.In Popular CultureIn the film American Psycho, protagonist Patrick Bateman proclaims that Invisible Touch is the group's "undisputed masterpiece", going on at length about its virtues to two prostitutes he has hired for the evening. The scene represents a chapter in the Bret Easton Ellis novel where Bateman muses about the significance of the album. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/quotesTrack listingAll music by Tony Banks/Phil Collins/Mike Rutherford.Side one"Invisible Touch" – 3:27"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight" – 8:53"Land of Confusion" – 4:45"In Too Deep" – 4:58Side two"Anything She Does" – 4:07"Domino" – 10:42Part One – "In the Glow of the Night"Part Two – "The Last Domino""Throwing It All Away" – 3:49"The Brazilian" – 4:49PersonnelPhil Collins – drums, percussion, vocalsTony Banks – keyboardsMike Rutherford – guitars, bass guitarChart positionsAlbum - Billboard (North America)YearChartPosition1986The Billboard 2003Singles - Billboard (North America)YearSingleChartPosition1986"Anything She Does"Mainstream Rock Tracks401986"Domino, Pt. 1 - In The Glow Of The Night/Pt. 2 - The Last Domino"Mainstream Rock Tracks291986"In Too Deep"Mainstream Rock Tracks251986"Invisible Touch"Adult Contemporary31986"Invisible Touch"Mainstream Rock Tracks11986"Invisible Touch"Billboard Hot 10011986"Land Of Confusion"Mainstream Rock Tracks111986"Land Of Confusion"Billboard Hot 10041986"Throwing It All Away"Adult Contemporary11986"Throwing It All Away"Mainstream Rock Tracks11986"Throwing It All Away"Billboard Hot 10041987"In Too Deep"Adult Contemporary11987"In Too Deep"Billboard Hot 10031987"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"Adult Contemporary81987"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"Mainstream Rock Tracks91987"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"Billboard Hot 1003External linksInvisible Touch (Music Video) at VH1 ClassicTonight, Tonight, Tonight (Music Video) at VH1 ClassicLand of Confusion (Music Video) at VH1 ClassicIn Too Deep (Music Video) at VH1 ClassicAnything She Does (Music Video) at VH1 ClassicThrowing It All Away (Music Video) at VH1 Classic  Category:1986 albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Genesis (band) albums Category:Virgin Records albums Category:Albums produced by Hugh Padghamde:Invisible Touch es:Invisible Touch fr:Invisible Touch it:Invisible Touch ka:Invisible Touch nl:Invisible Touch ja:インヴィジブル・タッチ pl:Invisible Touch pt:Invisible Touch sv:Invisible Touch
