He currently plays for Bordeaux as a defensive midfielder or centre back.Early yearsDiarra started out at CS Louhans-Cuiseaux, before moving to Bayern Munich in 2000. He did not play any matches for Bayern's first team, and spent a period on loan to SC Freiburg. In 2002 he was signed by Gérard Houllier's Liverpool, but never played a competitive match for the Reds either; instead, he had loan spells at Le Havre AC and SC Bastia.RC LensHe spent the whole of the 2004-05 season at RC Lens, before making the move permanent in the close season. At Lens, he became a first-team regular, and made his début for France; as of 18 June 2006, he has 12 caps for his country. This included coming on as a second half substitute for Patrick Vieira in the 2006 World Cup Final against Italy, which France went on to lose on penalties 5-3. Following the World Cup, he was involved in rumours of a transfer to Italian side, A.S. Roma during the 2006 Summer Transfer window. However he finally went to Lyon to replace the departed Mahamadou Diarra who was sold to Real Madrid for £17,700,000.BordeauxAfter failing to dislodge Jeremy Toulalan for the position of Defensive Midfielder at Lyon, Diarra was linked with a move to either English Premiership sides Manchester City, Portsmouth, Newcastle United and German outfit Werder Bremen. On July 19, 2007, Olympique Lyonnais agreed to transfer Diarra to Bordeaux at a fee of €7.75m. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said: "We have come to an agreement with Bordeaux and he will join them." Diarra replaced the departed Rio Antonio Mavuba.Diarra made his debut for Bordeaux in their first Ligue 1 match of the season against his former club Lens.
