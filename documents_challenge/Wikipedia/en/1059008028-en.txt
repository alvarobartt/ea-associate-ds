The club was for a time known as FC Den Haag, with ADO representing the amateur branch of the club. Despite being from one of the traditional three large Dutch cities, it has not been able to match Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV Eindhoven in terms of success in the Eredivisie or in European competition. There is nonetheless a big rivalry with Ajax and Feyenoord.HistoryThe club were founded in 1905, but found it hard to compete with other major Dutch teams partly due to the popularity of cricket in the city.ADO Den Haag won the Dutch national football title in 1942 and 1943 and the KNVB Cup in 1968 and 1975 (under the name FC Den Haag). Greatest European success was a quarter final game against West Ham United for the European Cup Winners Cup in 1976. A 4-2 win in The Hague followed by a 3-1 defeat in London meant elimination.ADO supporters have strong links with Welsh club Swansea City. Flags of the respective clubs are often flown at the matches of the other club, and both clubs regularly hold pre-season friendly matches. Legia Warszawa (Poland), Club Brugge K.V. (Belgium) and Juventus F.C. (Italy) also share strong supporter links with ADO Den Haag.After a long spell in the country's second tier of league football, ADO Den Haag played four seasons in the Eredivisie, they were relegated in the 2006-07 season, however after finishing 6th in the 2007-08 season they went on to win the play-offs meaning promotion back to the Eredivisie for 2008-09. The club's new home is the 15,000 seater Den Haag Stadion, there is not yet an official name for this stadium. They used to play the home games at the Zuiderpark Stadion, the ground will be sold for public housing. Their home colors are yellow and green. The average attendance in 2005/06 was 6,800 people, one of the lowest in the Eredivisie. They started the 2008-09 season with two wins, which put them on top of the Eredivisie for the first time in 32 years.Current squad                        Notable players Netherlands Dick Advocaat Ferrie Bodde Dorus De Vries Bram Appel Romeo Castelen Mick Clavan Johnny Dusbaba Hans Galjé Oeki Hoekema Rick Hoogendorp Peter Houtman Henk Houwaart Martin Jol John de Jong Aad de Jong Aad Kila Joop Korevaar Wim Landman Harry van der Laan Henk van Leeuwen Tscheu La Ling Woody Louwerens Aad Mansveld Michael Mols Rob Ouwehand Sjaak Polak Sjaak Roggeveen Lex Schoenmaker Carol Schuurman Jeffrey Talan Wim Tap Theo Timmermans Marciano Vink Simon van Vliet Mauk Weber André Wetzel Piet de ZoeteFormer managersMax Merkel (1954-1955)Ernst Happel (1962-1969)Vaclav Jezek (1969-1972)Vujadin Boškov (1974-1976)Piet de Visser (1978-1980)Anton Malatinský (1976-1978)Co Adriaanse (1988-1991)Rinus Israel (2001-2004)Frans Adelaar (2004-2006)Lex Schoenmaker (2006-2007)Wiljan Vloet (2007-2008)HonoursSee alsoDutch football league teamsExternal linksOfficial website of ADO Den Haag ADOFans.nl ADO Den Haag news ADO formations at football-lineups.com   Category:Dutch football clubs Category:ADO Den Haag Category:United Soccer Association imported teams Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1905 Category:Sport in The Hagueaf:ADO Den Haag ca:ADO Den Haag de:ADO Den Haag es:ADO Den Haag fr:ADO La Haye ko:ADO 덴하그 it:ADO Den Haag lt:ADO Den Haag ms:ADO Den Haag nl:ADO Den Haag ja:ADOデン・ハーグ no:ADO Den Haag pl:ADO Den Haag pt:ADO Den Haag ru:АДО Ден Хааг fi:ADO Den Haag sv:ADO Den Haag zh:ADO海牙
