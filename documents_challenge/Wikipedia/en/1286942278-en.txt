 The MacBook is a Macintosh notebook computer by Apple Inc. that replaced the iBook G4 series. The original MacBook was released on May 16, 2006, and utilized the Intel Core Duo processor and 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA950 integrated graphics on a 667 MHz front-side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor.The fifth and most recent update to the MacBook line occurred on February 26, 2008. It uses the Intel GM965 chipset, with Intel's X3100 integrated graphics on an 800 MHz system bus.OverviewThe MacBook features a widescreen 13.3" glossy LCD display with a 1280x800 resolution, and a built-in iSight webcam. Input and output ports include mini-DVI, built-in 10/100/1000 BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet, AirPort Extreme 802.11 wireless, two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 400 port, and Bluetooth 2.0. Sound capabilities include built-in stereo speakers, built-in omnidirectional microphone, audio line in, and headphone audio out. The MacBook closes with a magnetic latch mechanism. The MacBook uses a Scrolling TrackPad. Its hard disk is protected by a Sudden Motion Sensor. The memory controller operates in a dual channel memory mode when RAM is installed in each slot. Using a matched pair of memory modules (e.g. 2x1&nbsp;GB (2X1 GiB) is called interleaved dual channel, and theoretically results in higher performance than asymmetric dual channel when the modules are mismatched. The MacBook also includes a Trusted platform module chip.The MacBook is pre-loaded with Mac OS X v10.5, which includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, iTunes, and Xcode Developer Tools. It comes with iLife '08, which includes iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand.SpecificationsMacBook ModelEarly&nbsp;2006http://support.apple.com/specs/macbook/macbook.html1Late&nbsp;2006http://support.apple.com/specs/macbook/macbook_late_2006.htmlMid&nbsp;2007http://support.apple.com/specs/macbook/macbook_mid_2007.htmlLate&nbsp;2007http://support.apple.com/specs/macbook/MacBook_Late_2007.htmlEarly&nbsp;2008http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html5Release dateMay 16, 2006November 8, 2006May 15, 2007November 1, 2007February 26, 2008Display]]'''13.3-inch (viewable) glossy widescreen with 1280 x 800 pixel resolutionGraphics]]'''Intel GMA 950 graphics processor using 64&nbsp;MB (64 MiB) of DDR2 SDRAM shared by main memory (up to 224&nbsp;MB in Windows through Boot Camp).

In addition to the classic white case, Apple is offering a premium black case option; both cases are made of polycarbonate, the thermoplastic Apple is known for using in many of its products. The base black model originally cost US$150 more than a white model ordered with the same hardware configuration.Assuming same configuration. Based on  With the latest price revision, this difference has been decreased to US$100.Manufacture defectsSome early MacBook owners complained of discoloration that appeared on the palm rests of their white MacBooks. Apple acknowledged the issue and replaced the defective part. There have been quite a few of customers complaining about the cracks on the MacBooks bottom case after weeks or months of careful use due to the poor quality of the plastic and over-tightening of those screws. and may reflect lighting glare. The earlier versions of the Intel-based MacBooks are noted for having very inexpensive screens, making them incapable of using the millions of colors promised by Apple. This seems to have been rectified and Apple has settled a lawsuit in court.The issue with the LCD screens was addressed with a lawsuit. Apple Insider. March 26, 2008 The defect was due to the use of inexpensive 6-bit Twisted nematic LCD screens, the use of which is nearly universal throughout the portable market. It was partially concealed through the use of dithering.Twisted Nematic Film LCDs were also used in the recent 20 inch iMacs. This article points them out specifically. Apple Insider. March 30, 2008.KeyboardThe MacBook also features a new sunken keyboard design. Unlike the iBook, PowerBook G3, and Titanium PowerBook's keyboards, it is not removable; instead, each key is individually integrated into the casing with about 1.5&nbsp;mm between neighboring keys. This is ostensibly intended to give the keyboard a sturdier feel and to avoid keyboard contact with the screen when closed. There are two physical keyboard layouts: an ISO/international layout with a vertical return key crossing two rows, and a US/North America layout with a horizontal, wider return key in one row. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard underwent a slight redesign of offered functions and now closely mirrors the keyboard that ships with the iMac and includes the same player function hot-keys, removing the embedded virtual numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.The Vanishing Numeric Keypad, David Pogue, New York Times blog, 9 January 2008. This presaged removal of the included remote control at the February 2008 revision. The color scheme for keys and labels is white with grey lettering for the white model, and black with white lettering for the black model.Integrated graphicsThe Early 2006, Late 2006, and Mid 2007 revisions of the MacBook used an Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics processor.Starting with the Late 2007 revision, the MacBook uses an Intel GMA X3100 integrated graphics processor. Intel's integrated graphics chipsets have been criticized in the past for being unable to handle graphically-intensive tasks such as complex 3D gaming and other heavily GPU-dependent processes. However, the GMA X3100 is capable of playing most older games, and of rendering the Aero GUI when running Windows Vista.Apple most likely used integrated Intel graphics as a cost-cutting measure, as the Intel GMA chipset is cheaper than most discrete GPU solutions from ATI and NVIDIA. While the Intel GMA X3100 lacks dedicated video memory, it is, according to Intel, highly optimized for video playback and requires less power to operate than discrete graphics solutions, such as those offered by ATI and nVidia. However, the X3100 chip does not include hardware acceleration for H.264 video, though at the time of its inception this would have put its features set in line with most discrete graphics options.Despite the fact that the Intel GMA X3100 chipset has shown remarkable improvement over previous Intel chipsets, many owners of MacBook computers with the chipset have reported very poor performance under Mac OS X. In many cases, MacBooks with the X3100 chipset exhibit far inferior performance to Macs with the previous GMA 950 chipset, and even older low-end PowerPC-based Macs, such as older iMac and iBook models. The cause of the issues has been linked to poor-quality drivers in Mac OS X. As of yet, neither Apple nor Intel have done anything to resolve this issue.Benchmarks comparing the MacBook and MacBook Pro indicate that including a dedicated video solution would have placed the performance of the "consumer" oriented line close to the performance of the more expensive "professional" line.Recent rumors have indicated that the new MacBook line may utilize integrated GeForce 9 series chipsets as opposed to earlier Intel chipsets.User serviceabilityThe MacBook is different from its iBook predecessor in terms of user serviceability. Apple has made it easier to disassemble compared to the old iBook, which required removing many components such as the EMI shields to get to anything, whereas the MacBook requires simply the removal of the outer shell to access almost any interior component. In addition, the MacBook's internal hard drive and RAM are now easily accessible by simply removing the battery. via the underside of the unit. Further, the RAM and hard drive are considered user replaceable parts by Apple, meaning that these parts can be replaced by the end user without violating any terms of the warranty. Although, if a hard drive problem does occur after the user replaces it, it won't be replaced under your warranty. Apple provides step-by-step directions for replacing the hard drive and RAM. In contrast, replacement of the MacBook Pro's internal hard drive is more difficult, requiring disassembly by an authorized service provider to prevent risk of voiding the warranty.See alsoComparison of Macintosh modelsMacBook familyMacBook AirMacBook ProAxiotron ModbookReferencesExternal linksApple - MacBookMacBook Developer NoteMacBook Buyer's GuideMacBook Disassembly Instructions  Category:X86 Macintosh computers Category:Macintosh laptops Category:Macintosh computers by product linebg:MacBook cs:MacBook da:MacBook de:Apple MacBook es:MacBook fr:MacBook ko:맥북 is:MacBook it:MacBook he:MacBook lv:MacBook hu:MacBook nl:Apple MacBook ja:MacBook no:MacBook oc:MacBook uz:MacBook pl:MacBook pt:MacBook ru:MacBook sk:MacBook fi:MacBook sv:MacBook th:แมคบุ๊ก tr:MacBook zh:MacBook
