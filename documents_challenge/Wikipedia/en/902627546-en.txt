The town rises on a rock and is split into two parts by the steep Fiumarella valley, the two sections being connected by a huge concrete steel bridge (the Viadotto Morandi), among the highest in Europe, built in 1960 on a design by architect Riccardo Morandi. The beach side neighborhood Catanzaro Lido, located about 5 kilometers south, has a wide promenade and a harbor for small fishing and pleasure boats.HistoryThe origins of the name are debated. Some say it derived from two Byzantine generals, Kattaro and Zaro, while another theory is that Zaro was the original name of the river (Zarapotamo), so that katà Zaro would mean beyond the river. According to Luigi Settembrini, the name could also be derived by the Greek words kata'- antheros "on the flowery (hills)"The old town was built over three hills (St. Trifone or St. Rocco Hill; Episcopate's Hill; St. John's Hill) in Byzantine times.In the 15th century, under the Aragonese domination of southern Italy, Catanzaro was the silk producing capital of the world that created silks and lace for the world's courts and Vatican.
