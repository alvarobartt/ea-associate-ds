In spite of her outstanding performance as Crane and going on to becoming one of the most famous characters in Hollywood history, Leigh suffered typecasting due to the famous role. Her film career nosedived soon after, and as a result much of her post-''Psycho'' career was spent performing guest appearances on TV shows. Psycho earned her a Golden Globe and an Academy award nomination. Years later, she wrote a book in which she dispelled the urban legends which had popped up around its production, notably the immortal "shower scene".She had starring roles in many other films, including the Orson Welles film-noir classic Touch of Evil, 1962's The Manchurian Candidate with Frank Sinatra and the 1963 musical Bye Bye Birdie based on the hit Broadway show.In 1975, Leigh played a retired Hollywood song and dance star opposite Peter Falk and John Payne in Columbo: Forgotten Lady. She also appeared in two horror films with her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, playing a major role in The Fog (1980), and making a brief appearance in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998).Personal lifeLeigh married her third husband, Tony Curtis, on June 4, 1951. They had two children, actresses Kelly and the more well known Jamie Lee. Curtis, who admitted to cheating on her throughout their marriage, left Leigh in 1962 for Christine Kaufmann, the 17-year-old German co-star of his latest film Taras Bulba. Leigh was granted a quick divorce, and married stockbroker Robert Brandt later that year in Las Vegas. They remained married until her death.Leigh served on the board of directors of the Motion Picture and Television Foundation, a medical-services provider for actors.Leigh was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California on May 14, 2004.She died at her home on October 3, 2004 after suffering cardiac arrest, aged 77.
