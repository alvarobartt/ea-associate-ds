 Liguria is a coastal region of north-western Italy, the third smallest of the Italian regions. Its capital is Genoa. It is a popular region with tourists for its beautiful beaches, picturesque little towns, and food; Italy's world famous pesto sauce is originally from this region.GeographyLiguria borders France to the west, Piedmont to the north, and Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany to the east. It lies on the Ligurian Sea. The coastal strip forms the Italian Riviera; further inland are the Ligurian Alps, on the west, and the Ligurian Apennines on the east. Despite the high population density, woods cover half of the total area. The Ligurian coast enjoys a typical mediterranean climate, compared to the semi-continental climate of the Po valley to the north; in January, Genoa records an average temperature of about 8-10°C, with no frost, which can occur only in the mountainous interior. Summer averages about 25-30°C. Rainfall can be very abundant at times; mountains very close to the coast create an orographic effect, so Genoa can see up to 2000 mm of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal values of the Mediterranean area (500-800 mm).Liguria is divided into four provinces:Genoa (Genova)ImperiaLa SpeziaSavonaHistoryharbour]] ]] ]] Liguria is a very old name, dating back to pre-Roman times. Ancient Ligures settled the Mediterranean coast from Rhône to Arno, but later Gallic migration mixed and produced the Gallo-Ligurian culture. The region was officially subdued and colonised by the Roman Republic during the 2nd century BC. During the Middle Ages, Genoa gradually gained control of most of Liguria, which shared most of the city's history, and, with a few breaks in the 15th and early 16th century when the area was under either Milanese or French control, the Republic of Genoa ruled the area until 1796, when the French Revolutionary general Napoleon Bonaparte reorganized the area into the Ligurian Republic. The Ligurian Republic proved short-lived, however, and was annexed by France in 1805. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the area was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia.EconomyThe Ligurian economy is based on tourism, olive oil production, winemaking, fisheries, as well as various industrial sectors (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards, glass- and ceramics-making, slate extraction and manufacturing, railroad carriage and locomotive building, oil refineries, aviation) mainly concentrated in Genoa and the Province of Savona. Steel, once a major industry in the 50s and 60s is being phased out after the late 70s and 80s crisis, as Italy is moving away from heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced "light" industrial revolutions.PoliticsIn Medieval and Renaissance times the then city states of Liguria were controlled by merchant families. Genoa was then run by the powerful merchant families, prominently the Adorno and the Campofregoso.DemographicsDue to a severe economic crisis in the '80s and '90s Liguria lost 200,000 inhabitants, but after the economic recovery in the late '90s the region has attracted consistent fluxes of immigrants. As of 2006, the Italian national institute of statistics, ISTAT, estimated that 65,994 foreign-born immigrants live in Liguria, equal to 4.1% of the total regional population.Towns of Liguria with a population of 50,000 or more:CommunePopulation (2006 est.)Genoa620,316La Spezia94,263Savona61,766Sanremo57,120Imperia]]41,252Chiavari27,865Portovenere4,041Portofino521Image gallery Image:Panorama di Genova (Matitone).jpg|Genova Image:La Spezia.jpg|La Spezia Image:Savona-harbour01.jpg|Savona Image:Sanremo007.jpg|Sanremo Image:Imperia Porto Maurizio BMK.jpg|Imperia Image:Chiavari-Lavagna-panorama.jpg|Chiavari Image:Portovenere-vista01.jpg|Portovenere Image:Portofino 001.jpg|Portofino External linksWikipedia in Ligurian languageOfficial Region websiteOfficial website of the Ligurian regional governmentMap of LiguriaOfficial website of the Province of La Spezia, In ItalianConsorzio Mete di LiguriaGenoa AirportIIT - Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia* Category:NUTS 2 statistical regions of the European Union Category:Wine regions of Italyaf:Ligurië ar:ليغوريا an:Liguria frp:Ligurie zh-min-nan:Liguria bs:Ligurija br:Liguria (Rannvro) bg:Лигурия ca:Ligúria cs:Ligurie co:Liguria cy:Liguria da:Liguria de:Ligurien et:Liguuria eml:Ligûria es:Liguria eo:Ligurujo eu:Liguria fa:لیگوریا fr:Ligurie fy:Ligurje fur:Ligurie ga:Liguria gl:Liguria ko:리구리아 주 hr:Ligurija io:Liguria id:Liguria ia:Liguria is:Lígúría it:Liguria he:ליגוריה jv:Liguria pam:Liguria ka:ლიგურია kw:Liguri lad:Liguria la:Liguria lv:Ligūrija lt:Ligūrija lij:Liguria lmo:Ligüria hu:Liguria mk:Лигурија nl:Ligurië ja:リグーリア州 nap:Liguria no:Liguria nn:Liguria oc:Ligúria pms:Liguria pl:Liguria pt:Ligúria ro:Liguria qu:Liguria ru:Лигурия sq:Liguria scn:Liguria simple:Liguria sk:Ligúria sl:Ligurija sr:Лигурија sh:Ligurija fi:Liguria sv:Ligurien tr:Ligurya uk:Лігурія ur:لیگوریا vec:Łiguria zh:利古里亞
