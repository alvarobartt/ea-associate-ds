It was released on October 10, 1995, through the Reprise Records label. Though it reached number two in the United States and went double Platinum (According to the RIAA)RIAA Certificates for &quot;Insomniac&quot; by 1996, Insomniac did not have the sales endurance of its predecessor, Dookie, largely due to its slightly darker lyrical tone and more abrasive sound.Green Day: Behind the MusicBackgroundIn 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled "J.A.R.". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by "Insomniac," which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which said "In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets."Coleman, Mark. "Insomniac." Rolling Stone. November 1995.Before the name 'Insomniac', the band considered the naming the album Tight Wad Hill (After the thirteenth track of the album) and Jesus Christ Supermarket (Billie Joe later said that his biggest regret was "That we didn't name Insomniac "Jesus Christ Supermarket"). After visiting collage artist Winston Smith for the album cover, Billie Joe Armstrong asked him how he managed to make such intricate pieces in such short times. Smith answered, "It's easy for me. I am an insomniac."Winston Smith Gallery: God Told Me to Skin You Alive (Insomniac), 1995&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Cover artThe collage on the album cover was created by Winston Smith http://www.winstonsmith.com/ and is called God Told Me to Skin You Alive, a reference to a song by the Dead Kennedys. Interestingly enough, the cover art contains an image (the dentist) that was originally used in a collage featured in the inside cover art of Dead Kennedys' album Plastic Surgery Disasters. Smith knew Tré Cool from Green Day's time at Lookout! Records and told Tré that if he ever needed album artwork that he should call him.Tre & Winston http://www.winstonsmith.com/gallery/book2/big/insomniac.html&lt;/ref&gt; The cover art features several hidden images: a naked woman, 3 fairies, and several other ghostly faces in the flames.Hidden images in Winston Smith's "God Told Me to Sking You Alive" http://www.winstonsmith.com/gallery/book2/big/insomniac.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are also three skulls on the entire album cover and back; one for each member of Green Day. One of the skulls requires you to view the piece at an angle.
