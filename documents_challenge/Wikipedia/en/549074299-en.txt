 A trans-Neptunian object (TNO) is any object in the solar system that orbits the sun at a greater distance on average than Neptune. The Kuiper belt, scattered disk, and Oort cloud are three divisions of this volume of space.The orbit of each of the planets is affected by the gravitational influences of all the other planets. Discrepancies in the early 1900s between the observed and expected orbits of the known planets suggested that there were one or more additional planets beyond Neptune (see Planet X). The search for these led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930. Pluto is too small to explain the discrepancies, however, and revised estimates of Neptune's mass showed that the problem was spurious.It took more than 60 years to discover another TNO (with only the discovery of Pluto's moon Charon in between). Since 1992 however, 1075 objects have been discovered, differing in sizes, orbits and surface composition. But only 132 of these have a well determined orbit allowing easy observatory recovery.List of Transneptunian obectsDistribution and classificationThe diagram illustrates the distribution of known trans-Neptunian objects (up to 70 AU) in relation to the orbits of the planets together with Centaurs for reference. Different classes are represented in different colours. Resonant objects (i.e. objects in orbital resonance with Neptune) are plotted in red: (Neptune Trojans, plutinos, and a number of smaller families). The term Kuiper belt re-groups classical objects (cubewanos, in blue) with plutinos and twotinos (in red).The scattered disk extends to the right, far beyond the diagram, with known objects at mean distances beyond 500 AU (Sedna) and aphelia beyond 1000 AU ( ).

However, the interpretations are typically ambiguous as the spectra can fit more than one model of the surface composition and depend on the unknown particle size. More significantly, the optical surfaces of small bodies are subject to modification by intense radiation, solar wind and micrometeorites. Consequently, the thin optical surface layer could be quite different from the regolith underneath , and not representative of the bulk composition of the body.Small TNOs are thought to be low density mixtures of rock and ice with some organic (carbon-containing) surface material such as tholin, detected in their spectra. On the other hand, the high density of , 2.6-3.3 g/cm3, suggests a very high non-ice content (compare with Pluto's density: 2.0 g/cm3).The composition of some small TNO could be similar to that of comets. Indeed, some Centaurs undergo seasonal changes when they approach the Sun, making the boundary blurred (see 2060 Chiron and 133P/Elst-Pizarro). However, population comparisons between Centaurs and TNO are still object of controversy. N. Peixinho, A. Doressoundiram, A. Delsanti, H. Boehnhardt, M. A. Barucci, and I. Belskaya Reopening the TNOs Color Controversy: Centaurs Bimodality and TNOs Unimodality Astronomy and Astrophysics, 410, L29-L32 (2003). Preprint on arXivColorsLike Centaurs, TNO display a wide range of colors from blue-grey to very red but unlike the centaurs, clearly re-grouped into two classes, the distribution appears to be uniform.Color indices are simple measures of the differences of the apparent magnitude of an object seen through blue (B), visible (V) i.e. green-yellow and red ® filters. The diagram illustrates known color indices for all but the biggest objects (in slightly enhanced color). O. R. Hainaut & A. C.

Preprint on arXivA recent analysis based on the data from Deep Ecliptic Survey confirms this difference of colours between low inclination objects (named Core) and high inclination (named Halo). Red colors of the Core objects together with their unperturbed orbits suggest that these objects could be a relic of the original population of the Belt. Gulbis, Amanda A. S.; Elliot, J.

Scattered disk objectsScattered disk objects show color resemblances with hot classical objects pointing to a common origin.The largest objectsCharacteristically, big (bright) objects are typically on inclined orbits, while the invariable plane re-groups mostly small and dim objects. With the exception of Sedna, all big TNOs: Eris, , , Charon, and Orcus display neutral colour (infrared index V-I The diagram illustrates the relative sizes, albedos and colours of the biggest TNOs. Also shown, are the known satellites and the exceptional shape of  () resulting from its rapid rotation. The arc around  () represents uncertainty given its unknown albedo. The size of Eris follows Michael Brown’s measure (2400 km) based on HST point spread model. The arc around it represents the thermal measure (3000 km) by Bertoldi (see the related section of the article for the references).SpectraThe objects present wide range of spectra, differing in reflectivity in visible red and near infrared. Neutral objects present a flat spectrum, reflecting as much red and infrared as visible spectrum. A. Barucci Trans Neptunian Objects’ surface properties, IAU Symposium #229, Asteroids, Comets, Meteors, Aug 2005, Rio de Janeiro Very red objects present a steep slope, reflecting much more in red and infrared. A recent attempt at classification (common with Centaurs) uses the total of four classes from BB (blue, average B-V=0.70, V-R=0.39 e.g. Orcus) to RR (very red, B-V=1.08, V-R=0.71, e.g. Sedna) with BR and IR as intermediate classes. BR and IR differ mostly in the infrared bands I, J and H.Typical models of the surface include water ice, amorphous carbon, silicates and organic macromolecules, named tholins, created by intense radiation. Four major tholins are used to fit the reddening slope:Titan tholin, believed to be produced from a mixture of 90% N2 and 10% CH4 (gaseous methane)Triton tholin, as above but with very low (0.1%) methane content(ethane) Ice tholin I, believed to be produced from a mixture of 86% H2O and 14% C2H6 (ethane)(methanol) Ice tholin II, 80% H2O, 16% CH3OH (methanol) and 3% CO2As an illustration of the two extreme classes BB and RR, the following compositions have been suggestedfor Sedna (RR very red): 24% Triton tholin, 7% carbon, 10%N2, 26% methanol, 33% methanefor Orcus (BB, grey/blue): 85% amorphous carbon +4% titan tholin, 11% H20 iceSize determinationIt is difficult to estimate the diameter of TNOs. For very large objects, with very well known orbital elements (namely, Pluto and Charon), diameters can be precisely measured by occultation of stars.For other large TNOs, diameters can be estimated by thermal measurements. The intensity of light illuminating the object is known (from its distance to the Sun), and one assumes that most of its surface is in thermal equilibrium (usually not a bad assumption for an airless body). For a known albedo, it is possible to estimate the surface temperature, and correspondingly the intensity of heat radiation. Further, if the size of the object is known, it is possible to predict both the amount of visible light and emitted heat radiation reaching the Earth. A simplifying factor is that the Sun emits almost all of its energy in visible light and at nearby frequencies, while at the cold temperatures of TNOs, the heat radiation is emitted at completely different wavelengths (the far infrared).Thus there are two unknowns (albedo and size), which can be determined by two independent measurements (of the amount of reflected light and emitted infrared heat radiation).Unfortunately, TNOs are so far from the Sun that they are very cold, hence produce black-body radiation around 60 micrometres in wavelength. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth's surface, but only from space using, e.g., the Spitzer Space Telescope. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs. For the majority of (small) objects, the diameter is estimated by assuming an albedo. However, the albedos found range from 0.50 down to 0.05 resulting, as example for magnitude of 1.0, in uncertainty from 1200 – 3700 km!http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Sizes.html.Largest discoveries  Currently lying at 97 AU away, Eris is the farthest known object in the solar system, and the third brightest of the TNOs. Classified as a scattered disk object (SDO), Eris follows an orbit at 10 billion kilometres from the Sun, completing it in 560 years at an unusual 45-degree angle.
