He was an all-round player and leader, possessing great tackling and a hard shot.CareerNationalDuring his youth, Effenberg played for SC Victoria Hamburg before he successfully changed to bigger teams: Borussia Mönchengladbach (1987-90 and 1994-98), Bayern Munich (1990-92 and 1998-2002), AC Fiorentina (1992-94), and VfL Wolfsburg (2002-03). He was the lead player of Bayern Munich when they won the UEFA Champions League in 2001. During the same tournament, Effenberg won also the UEFA Champions League Most Valuable Player for his elegant (and sometimes seemingly lazy style) of play. He ended his career playing in Qatar with Al-Arabi.InternationalEffenberg played 35 games for the German national team and scored five goals. However, his international career was marked by controversy and several years in the international wilderness after the DFB refused to consider Effenberg for selection following an incident at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In the group game against South Korea, Effenberg had gestured in an inappropriate manner (&quot;gave the finger&quot;) to disappointed fans at Cotton Bowl in Dallas when he got substituted due to his mediocre performance.Effenberg quits...123Football.com Because of this incident, coach Berti Vogts decided to drop Effenberg from the German national team for the remainder of the tournament.Doing it his own way&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Effenberg was briefly re-instated to the national team four years later for a couple of friendly matches in September. These games proved to be his last caps and also Vogts' final matches in charge of the national team.International goalsScores and results table.

Barry got his retribution by scoring the opening goal in the team's 1-1 draw at Musgrave Park.Personal lifeIn the late 1990s Effenberg was rarely out of the tabloids when he left his wife Martina and revealed an affair with Claudia Strunz, who at that time was the wife of former team mate Thomas Strunz. Later Effenberg published a controversial autobiography, notorious for its blatant contents and the poor language it was written in. Claudia Strunz and Effenberg were married in 2004.References    Effenberg, Stefan Effenburg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Effenberg, Stefan Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:German expatriates in Italyar:شتيفان إفينبيرغ de:Stefan Effenberg es:Stefan Effenberg fr:Stefan Effenberg it:Stefan Effenberg he:סטפן אפנברג ka:შტეფან ეფენბერგი hu:Stefan Effenberg nl:Stefan Effenberg ja:シュテファン・エッフェンベルク no:Stefan Effenberg pl:Stefan Effenberg pt:Stefan Effenberg ru:Эффенберг, Штефан fi:Stefan Effenberg sv:Stefan Effenberg zh:斯特凡·埃芬伯格
