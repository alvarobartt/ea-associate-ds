Limnocharitaceae is the botanical name of a family of flowering plants. Such a family has not been recognized by many taxonomists. It is sometimes known as the water poppy family.The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does recognize such a family and places it in the order Alismatales, in the clade monocots. The family then includes only a few genera, totalling something like half-a-dozen species of aquatic plants.GeneraHydrocleysHydrocleys nymphoides - water-poppyLimnocharisLimnocharis flava - sawah-lettuceExternal linksLimnocharitaceae in L.
