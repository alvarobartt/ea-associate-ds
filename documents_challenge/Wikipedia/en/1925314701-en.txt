He also studied economics and management for his 1986 MBA from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.In recent years, Adams has had a series of debilitating health problems. Since late 2004, he has suffered from a reemergence of his focal dystonia which has affected his drawing, though he can work around the problem by drawing using a graphics tablet. He also suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes the vocal cords to behave in an abnormal manner. He recovered from this condition temporarily but in July 2008 underwent surgery to rewire the nerve connections to his vocal cord, which may enable him to regain his voice, speaking weakly at first and improving over the year, as his nerve pathways regenerate.Adams is trained as a hypnotist and is a vegetarian.Mentioned in Dilbert: A Treasury of Sunday Strips He is a strong believer in affirmations, which he credits with his career, Dilbert's success, a ninety-four on a difficult qualification test for Berkeley, among other unlikely events.Mentioned in The Dilbert FutureHe married Shelly Miles in 2006.He has described his own political views as "Libertarian, minus the crazy stuff,"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/16/dilbert.economy/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and he supported Michael Bloomberg for president in 2008.CareerAdams writes in a satirical, often sarcastic way about the social and mental landscape of white-collar workers in modern corporations and other large enterprises. The style is reminiscent of other writers in this genre, for example C. Northcote Parkinson.Prior to his success as a writer/cartoonist, Adams worked closely with telecommunications engineers at Crocker National Bank in San Francisco between 1979 and 1986, and at Pacific Bell between 1986 and June 1995, and draws on their personalities for those of his Dilbert characters. Adams first published Dilbert in 1989, while still employed at Pacific Bell.He is also the CEO of Scott Adams Foods, Inc., makers of the Dilberito & Protein Chef, and a co-owner of Stacey's Café in Pleasanton, California. Much of his interest in the food business comes from the fact that he is a vegetarian.Stephan Pastis, creator of Pearls Before Swine, credits Adams for launching his career as a cartoonist.In 1997, at the invitation of Logitech CEO Pierluigi Zappacosta, Adams, wearing a wig and false mustache, successfully impersonated a management consultant and tricked Logitech managers into adopting a mission statement that Adams described as "so impossibly complicated that it has no real context whatsoever."http://web.mit.edu/jcb/humor/scott-adams-mgmt-consultant&lt;/ref&gt;Adams is an avid fan of the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.
