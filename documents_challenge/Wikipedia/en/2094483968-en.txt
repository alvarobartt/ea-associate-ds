As well as being King of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth Realms, George was the Emperor of India and the first King of the Irish Free State. George reigned from 1910 through World War I (1914–1918) until his death in 1936.From the age of twelve George served in the Royal Navy, but upon the unexpected death of his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, he became heir to the throne and married his brother's fiancée, Mary of Teck (known as "May" to her family after her birth month). Although they occasionally toured the British Empire, George preferred to stay at home with his stamp collection and lived what later biographers would consider a dull life because of its conventionality.When George's father, King Edward VII died in 1910, he became King-Emperor. He was the only Emperor of India to be present at his own Delhi Durbar, where he appeared before his Indian subjects crowned with the Imperial Crown of India, created specially for the occasion. During World War I he relinquished all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects; and changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. During his reign, the Statute of Westminster separated the crown so that George ruled the dominions as separate kingdoms, preparing the way for the future development of the Commonwealth. His reign also witnessed the rise of socialism, fascism, Irish republicanism and the first Labour ministry, all of which radically changed the political spectrum.George was plagued by illness throughout much of his later reign; he was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward, upon his death.Early life and educationGeorge was born on 3 June 1865, at Marlborough House, London. His father was the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His mother was the Princess of Wales (later Queen Alexandra), the eldest daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. As a grandson of Queen Victoria in the male line, George was styled His Royal Highness Prince George of Wales at birth.He was baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 7 July 1865.His godparents were the King of Hanover, the Queen and Crown Prince of Denmark, Ernst, 4th Prince of Leiningen, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Alice and the Duke of Cambridge. Source: The Times (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p.12 As a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was no expectation that George would become King as his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, was second in line to the throne after their father.Given that George was born only fifteen months after his brother, Prince Albert Victor, it was decided to educate both royal princes together. The Prince of Wales appointed John Neale Dalton as their tutor, although neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually. In September 1877 both brothers joined the training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS Britannia]] at Dartmouth. Their father thought that the navy was "the very best possible training for any boy".Sinclair, pp.49–50For three years from 1879 the royal brothers served as midshipmen on [[HMS Bacchante (1876)|HMS Bacchante]], accompanied by Dalton. They toured the British Empire, visiting Norfolk, Virginia, the colonies in the Caribbean, South Africa and Australia, as well as the Mediterranean, South America, the Far East, and Egypt. In Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm. Dalton wrote an account of their journey entitled The Cruise of HMS Bacchante.Sinclair, p.55 Between Melbourne and Sydney, Dalton records a sighting of the Flying Dutchman, a mythical ghost ship. When they returned to the UK, the brothers were separated with Albert Victor attending Trinity College, Cambridge and George continuing in the Royal Navy. He travelled the world and visited many areas of the British Empire, serving actively in the navy until his last command in 1891. From then on his naval rank was largely honorary.Sinclair, p.69MarriageAs a young man destined to serve in the Navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was stationed in Malta. There, he grew close to and fell in love with his uncle's daughter, his first cousin, Marie of Edinburgh. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers, the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh, both opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. When George proposed, Marie refused, guided by her mother. She later became Queen of Romania.In 1891, Albert Victor became engaged to his second cousin once removed, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as "May" to her family, after her birth month), the only daughter of Prince Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge. However, Albert Victor died of pneumonia six weeks later, leaving George second in line to the throne and likely to succeed after his father. This effectively ended George's naval career, as he was now expected to assume a more political role.&lt;/ref&gt;Queen Victoria still favoured Princess May as a suitable candidate to marry a future king, so she persuaded George to propose to May. George duly proposed and May accepted. The marriage was a success and throughout their lives the couple exchanged notes of endearment and loving letters.Sinclair, p.178The marriage of George and May took place on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London. At the wedding, The Times claimed, the crowd may have confused Nicholas of Russia (later the Tsar) with George, because their beards and dress made them look alike superficially.The Times (London) Friday, 7 July 1893, p.5 Their facial features were only different up close.See a photograph of them side-by-sideDuke of YorkOn 24 May 1892 Queen Victoria created George, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney. After George's marriage to May, she was styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York.The Duke and Duchess of York lived mainly at York Cottage,Renamed from Bachelor's Cottage a relatively small house in Sandringham, Norfolk where their way of life mirrored that of a comfortable middle-class family rather than royalty. George preferred the simple, almost quiet, life in marked contrast to his parents. Even his official biographer despaired of George's time as Duke of York, writing: "He may be all right as a young midshipman and a wise old king, but when he was Duke of York...he did nothing at all but kill [i.e. shoot] animals and stick in stamps."Harold Nicolson's diary quoted in Sinclair, p.107George was a well-known stamp collector, and played a large role in building the Royal Philatelic Collection into the most comprehensive collection of United Kingdom and Commonwealth stamps in the world, in some cases setting record purchase prices for items. His enthusiasm for stamps was denigrated by the intelligentsia.Rose, p.42at Sandringham House: George V and Queen Mary lived here from 1893 until 1926.]]Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, to the extent that his children were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: "My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going to see to it that my children are frightened of me." In reality there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.See Sinclair, pp.93 ff for a full discussion George and May had five sons and a daughter.Prince of WalesAs Duke and Duchess of York, George and May carried out a wide variety of public duties. On the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, George's father, Albert Edward, ascended the throne as King Edward VII. George inherited the titles of Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, and for much of the rest of that year, George was styled His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and York. In 1901, George and May toured the British Empire, visiting Australia, where the Duke opened the first session of the Australian Parliament upon the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia. Their tour included South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand, where Cornwall Park in Auckland was named in their honour by its donor, John Logan Campbell, then Mayor of Auckland.On 9 November 1901, George was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. King Edward VII wished his son to have more preparation and experience prior to his future role. In contrast to Edward himself, whom Queen Victoria had excluded from state affairs, George was given wide access to state documents and papers by his father. George in turn allowed his wife access to his papers,Rose, p.289 as he valued her counsel and May often helped write her husband's speeches.Sinclair, p.107In 1906, he toured India where he was disgusted by racial discrimination and campaigned for greater involvement of Indians in the government of the country.Rose, pp.65–66George Frederick Abbott's Through India with the Prince (1906) describes the tour., sculptor)]]King and EmperorOn 6 May 1910, King Edward VII died, and the Prince of Wales ascended the throne, becoming King George V. George had never liked his wife's habit of signing official documents and letters as "Victoria Mary" and insisted she drop one of those names. Neither thought she should be called Queen Victoria, and so she became Queen Mary.Pope-Hennessy, p.421 Their coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 22 June 1911. The coronation was celebrated by the Festival of Empire in London.Later in 1911, the King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar, where they were presented to an assembled audience of Indian dignitaries and princes as the Emperor and Empress of India. George wore the newly-created Imperial Crown of India at the ceremony. Then the Emperor and Empress travelled throughout India, visiting their new subjects. George took the opportunity to indulge in hunting tigers, shooting 21.Rose, p.136 On 18 December 1913 George shot over a thousand pheasants in six hoursAbout one bird every 20 seconds. at the home of Lord Burnham, although even he had to acknowledge that "we went a little too far" that day.[[Image:A Good Riddance - George V of the United Kingdom cartoon in Punch, 1917.png|right|thumb|"A good riddance"A 1917 Punch cartoon depicting King George V sweeping away his German titles. Changing the name of his family's royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor was a popular move.]]World War IFrom 1914 to 1918 Britain was at war with Germany. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II, who for the British public came to symbolise all the horrors of the war, was the King's first cousin. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Royal House of Württemberg.The King's paternal grandfather was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, Prince and Princess of Hesse and by Rhine, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. Writer H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's "alien and uninspiring court", and George famously replied: "I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien."On 17 July 1917, George V issued an Order-in-Council that changed the name of the British Royal House from the German-sounding House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor, to appease British nationalist feelings. He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants of Queen Victoria then living in the United Kingdom, excluding women who married into other families and their descendants.Finally, on behalf of his various relatives who were British subjects he relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, overnight his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge. Others, such as Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, simply stopped using their territorial designations. In Letters Patent gazetted on 11 December 1917, the King restricted the style "His (or Her) Royal Highness" and the titular dignity of "Prince (or Princess) of Great Britain and Ireland" to the children of the Sovereign, the children of the sons of the Sovereign and the eldest living son of the eldest living son of a Prince of Wales.Nicolson, p.310(their mothers - Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia - were sisters). Berlin, 1913]]The Letters Patent also stated that "the titles of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness, and the titular dignity of Prince and Princess shall cease except those titles already granted and remaining unrevoked." Relatives of the British Royal Family who fought on the German side, such as Prince Ernst August of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale (the senior male-line great grandson of George III) and Prince Carl Eduard, Duke of Albany and the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (a male-line grandson of Queen Victoria), were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. George also removed their Garter flags from St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle under pressure from his mother, Queen Alexandra.When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, a first cousin of George through his mother, Queen Alexandra (Nicholas II's mother was Empress Maria Feodorovna, Queen Alexandra's sister) was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British Government offered asylum to the Tsar and his family but worsening conditions for the British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George to think that the presence of the Romanovs might seem inappropriate under the circumstances.Sinclair, p.148 and Nicolson, p.301 Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that David Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, was opposed to the rescue of the Romanovs, records of the King's private secretary, Lord Stamfordham, suggest that George V opposed the rescue against the advice of Lloyd George.Rose, p.210 Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by MI1, a branch of the British secret service, but because of the strengthening Bolshevik position and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation.Sinclair, p.149 The Tsar and his immediate family thus remained in Russia and were murdered by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918. The following year, George's aunt Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) and other members of the extended Russian imperial family were rescued from the Crimea by British ships.Two months after the end of the war, the King's youngest son, John, died aged 13 after a short lifetime of ill-health. George was informed of the death by the Queen who wrote, "John had been a great anxiety to us for many years…The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind & sympathetic & this has helped us much."Pope-Hennessy, p.511Later lifeDuring and after World War I, many of the monarchies which had ruled most European countries fell. In addition to Russia, the monarchies of Austria, Germany, Greece, and Spain also fell to revolution and war, although the Greek monarchy was restored again shortly before George's death. Most of these countries were ruled by relatives of George. In 1922, a Royal Navy ship was sent to Greece to rescue his cousins, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (a nephew of Queen Alexandra through her brother King George I of Greece) and Princess Alice of Battenberg (a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg, one of the German princes granted a British peerage in 1917) and their children, including Prince Philip, who would later marry George's granddaughter, Elizabeth II.George also took an interest in the political turmoil in Ireland, expressing his horror at government-sanctioned killings and reprisals to Prime Minister Lloyd George.Sinclair, p.114 and Nicolson, p.347 During the General Strike of 1926 the King took exception to suggestions that the strikers were 'revolutionaries' saying, "Try living on their wages before you judge them."Sinclair, p.105 He also advised the Government against taking inflammatory action.Nicolson, p.419In 1932, George agreed to deliver a Royal Christmas speech on the radio, an event which became annual thereafter. He was not in favour of the innovation originally but was persuaded by the argument that it was what his people wanted.Sinclair p.154 He was concerned by the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, and warned the British ambassador in Berlin to be suspicious of the fascists.Nicolson, pp.521–522 By the silver jubilee of his reign in 1935, he had become a well-loved king, saying in response to the crowd's adulation, "I cannot understand it, after all I am only a very ordinary sort of fellow."Sinclair, p.1George's relationship with his heir, Prince Edward deteriorated in these later years. George was disappointed in Edward's failure to settle down in life and appalled by his many affairs with married women. He was reluctant to see Edward inherit the crown. In contrast, he was fond of his second eldest son, Prince Albert (later George VI) and doted on his eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth; he nicknamed her "Lilibet", and she affectionately called him "Grandpa England". George was quoted as saying about his son Edward: "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself within 12 months," and about Albert and Lilibet: "I pray to God my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."Death, outside Westminster Abbey, London]]World War I took a toll on George's health, and his heavy smoking exacerbated recurring breathing problems. He long suffered from emphysema, bronchitis, chronic obstructive lung disease and pleurisy. In 1928, he fell seriously ill, and for the next two years his son Edward took over many of his duties.Ziegler, pp.192–196 The King retired for a brief period to the seaside resort of Bognor Regis in West Sussex.Pope-Hennessy, p.546 A myth later grew that his last words, upon being told that he would soon be well enough to revisit the town, were "Bugger Bognor!"George never fully recovered. In his final year, he was occasionally administered oxygen. In the evening of 15 January 1936, the King took to his bedroom at Sandringham House complaining of a cold; he would never leave the room alive.Pope-Hennessy, p.558 He became gradually weaker, drifting in and out of consciousness. The diary of his physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, reveals that the King's last words, a mumbled "God damn you!", were addressed to his nurse when she gave him a sedative on the night of the 20 January. When the King was already comatose and close to death, Dawson admits hastening the King's end by giving him a lethal injection of cocaine and morphine, both to prevent further strain on the family and so that the news of his death could be announced in the morning edition of The Times newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at 11.55 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.At the procession to George's Lying in State in Westminster Hall, as the cortege turned into New Palace Yard, the Maltese Cross fell from the Imperial Crown and landed in the gutter. The new King, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether this was a bad omen for his new reign.The Duke of Windsor, p.267The cross, composed of a sapphire and 200 diamonds, was retrieved by a military man following later in the procession. He would abdicate before the year was out, leaving Albert, Duke of York, to ascend to the throne.As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, King Edward VIII, the Duke of York, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night of 28 January, the day before the funeral.The Times (London), Tuesday, 28 January 1936, p.10 col. FTributesoutside Brisbane City Hall]]A statue of King George V was unveiled outside Brisbane City Hall in 1938 as a tribute to the King from the citizens of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The square on which the statue stands was originally called Albert Square, but was later renamed King George Square in honour of King George V. In London, a statue by William Reid Dick stands outside the east end of Westminster Abbey.The King George's Fields in London were created as a memorial by a committee in 1936 chaired by the then Lord Mayor of the City of London. Today they are each registered charities and are under the guidance of the National Playing Fields Association. The national stadium of Newfoundland in St. John's was named King George V Park in 1925. Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have major thoroughfares named for King George V—''Rehov ha-Melekh George''. Both date back to the period of the British Mandate for Palestine. In Paris, a large avenue from the top of the Champs-Elysées down to the Seine river and an underground station were named for George V; as are Avenue Georges, Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada; King George V Avenue, Sale, Victoria, Australia; King George V Secondary School, Malaysia; and King George V School and King George V Memorial Park in Hong Kong.The World War I Royal Navy battleship [[HMS King George V (1911)|HMS King George V]] and the World War II Royal Navy battleship [[HMS King George V (41)|HMS King George V]] were named in his honour.Titles, styles, honours and armsTitles3 June 1865 – 24 May 1892: His Royal Highness Prince George of Wales24 May 1892 – 22 January 1901: His Royal Highness The Duke of York22 January 1901 – 9 November 1901: His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and York9 November 1901 – 6 May 1910: His Royal Highness The Prince of Walesin Scotland: His Royal Highness The Duke of Rothesay6 May 1910 – 20 January 1936: His Majesty The Kingand, occasionally, outside of the United Kingdom, and with regard to India: His Imperial Majesty The King-EmperorStylesPrior to his accession, on 6 May 1910, George held the full style "His Royal Highness The Prince George Frederick Ernest Albert, Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Duke of York, Earl of Carrick, Earl of Inverness, Baron Renfrew, Baron Killarney, Lord of the Isles, Prince and Great Steward of Scotland, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, Knight of the Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick, Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, Knight Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Imperial Service Order, Royal Victorian Chain, Member of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, Royal Fellow of the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, Admiral of the Royal Navy"His full style as king was "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India", until 1927, when it was changed, albeit superficially, to "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India"HonoursKG: Knight of the Garter, 4 August 1884KT: Knight of the Thistle, 5 July 1893KP: Knight of St Patrick, 20 August 1897GCSI: Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India, 28 September 1905GCMG: Knight Grand Cross of St Michael and St George, 9 March 1901GCIE: Knight Grand Commander of the Indian Empire, 28 September 1905GCVO: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, 30 June 1897ISO: Imperial Service Order, 31 March 1903Royal Victorian Chain, 1902PC: Privy Counsellor, 18 July 1894Privy Counsellor (Ireland), 20 August 1897FRS: Royal Fellow of the Royal Society, 8 June 1893Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports & Constable of Dover Castle, 1905–1907President of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, 1893–1895President of the Royal Agricultural Society of England,1897–1903MilitaryCdt, September 1877: Cadet, [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS Britannia]]Mid, 8 January 1880: Midshipman, HMS Bacchante and the corvette CanadaSLt, 3 June 1884: Sub-Lieutenant, Royal NavyLt, 8 October 1885: Lieutenant, [[HMS Thunderer (1872)|HMS Thunderer]]; [[HMS Dreadnought (1875)|HMS Dreadnought]]; [[HMS Alexandra (1875)|HMS Alexandra]]; [[HMS Northumberland (1865)|HMS Northumberland]]I/C Torpedo Boat 79; the gunboat ThrushCdr, 24 August 1891: Commander, I/C the MelampusCapt, 2 January 1893: Captain, Royal NavyRAdm, 1 January 1901: Rear-Admiral, Royal NavyVAdm, 26 June 1903: Vice-Admiral, Royal NavyAdm, 1907: Admiral, Royal Navy1910: Admiral of the Fleet, Royal NavyMRAF, Marshal of the Royal Air ForceArmsAs Duke of York, George's arms were the royal arms, with an inescutcheon for Saxony, all differenced with a label argent of three points, the centre bearing an anchor azure.
