It is located in southeast Tennessee on Chickamauga and Nickajack Lake, which are both part of the Tennessee River, near the border of Georgia, and at the junction of three interstate highways, I-24, I-75, and I-59.The city (downtown elevation approximately 685 feet), which lies at the transition between the ridge-and-valley portion of the Appalachian Mountains and the Cumberland Plateau, is surrounded by mountains and ridges.HistoryThe first inhabitants of the Chattanooga area were Native American Indians with sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, showing continuous occupation through the Archaic, Woodland, Mississippian (900-1650 AD), Muskogean and Cherokee (1776 - 1838 AD) periods.Chief John Ross has been quoted as stating that Chattanooga was Cherokee for 'The Big Catch' because of the fishing on the river. In the 1875 publication 'History of the Army of the Cumberland' by Thomas Budd Van Horne and Edward Ruger on page 407 this is related:"Historians have made effort to transmit to the future the significance of the names which distinguish the natural features around Chattanooga. It is no pleasant task to leave groundless the many pretty conceits which have so long passed for facts; but he who would write the truth, must not hesitate to dissipate a myth or disclose a false hypothesis. With only occasional allusion to the various interpretations of Cherokee names, which have so long been accepted as true, their actual meaning, as derived from John Ross, the celebrated Cherokee chief, and from Lewis Ross, his brother, are here given. "Chattanooga," originally was the name of a small Indian hamlet, situated near the base of Lookout Mountain, on the bank of Chattanooga creek. It means, in the Cherokee language, " to draw fish out of water," and hence was applied to the collection of huts, which were occupied by Indian fishermen. The humble hamlet disappeared, and its name, at first suggestive and appropriate, was inherited by the town of the white man, with meaningless application. A somewhat similar name was applied by the Cherokees to the cliffs, rising boldly from the river above the town, which was derived from "Clanoowah," the name of a warlike but diminutive hawk, which was supposed to embody the spirit of the tribe. These cliffs were the favorite nesting- place of the bird, and hence a name was given which expressed this fact, and which, perhaps, has suggested the myth, that 'Chattanooga' means 'eagle's nest.'"The earliest Cherokee occupation dates from Dragging Canoe, who in 1776 separated himself and moved downriver from the main tribe to establish Native American resistance (see Chickamauga Wars) to European settlement in the southeastern United States. Occupation of the area by members of the Cherokee Nation dates from 1816 with the establishment of Ross's Landing by later tribal chief John Ross and ended with the forced relocation of Native American Indians from southeastern U.S. states to Oklahoma in 1838. Ross's Landing was one of three large internment camps, or "emigration depots," along the Trail of Tears, the other two being Fort Payne, Alabama and the largest at Fort Cass, Tennessee.is visible in the background.]] During the American Civil War on November 23, 1863, the Third Battle of Chattanooga began when Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant reinforced troops at Chattanooga and counterattacked Confederate troops. The next day, the Battle of Lookout Mountain was fought near the town. These were followed the next spring by the Atlanta Campaign, beginning just over the nearby state line in Georgia and moving southeastward.After the war ended, the city became a major railroad hub and industrial and manufacturing center. By the 1930s it was known as the "Dynamo of Dixie," and even inspired the 1941 Glenn Miller big-band swing song "Chattanooga Choo Choo." But the same mountains that provided Chattanooga's scenic backdrop became shrouded by the industrial pollutants that they trapped and held over the community. In 1969, the federal government declared that Chattanooga's air was the dirtiest in the nation. But environmental crises were not the only problems plaguing the city. Chattanooga entered the 1980s with serious socioeconomic challenges including job layoffs, a deteriorating city infrastructure, racial tensions and social division.In recent years, private and governmental resources have been invested in transforming the city's tarnished image and to gain recognition for a metamorphosis of its downtown and riverfront areas. An early cornerstone of this project was the restoration of the historic Walnut Street Bridge. The Walnut Street Bridge is the oldest surviving bridge of its kind in the Southeastern United States. Efforts to improve the city include the "21st Century Waterfront Plan" - a $120 million redevelopment of the Chattanooga waterfront and downtown area.  In 1935, as well as from 1993 to 1995, Chattanooga hosted the National Folk Festival.EconomyThe local economy includes a diversified mix of manufacturing and service industries.Notable Chattanooga businesses include BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, CBL &amp; Associates, The Chattanooga Bakery, Chattem, the world's first Coca-Cola bottling plant, Coker Tire, Coptix, Covenant Transport, Double Cola, Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant Group, Krystal, Litespeed, Miller &amp; Martin, National Model Railroad Association, Olan Mills, Inc., Republic Parking System, Rock/Creek, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Tricycle Inc., and Unum. The city also hosts large branch offices of Cigna, AT&amp;T and UBS.Companies that have manufacturing or distribution facilities in the city include DuPont, Rock-Tenn, Plantronics, Domtar Corp., Norfolk Southern, Alco Chemical, Colonial Pipeline and Buzzi Unicem. There is also a Vulcan Materials quarry in the city.On July 15 2008, Volkswagen Group announced plans to build its new production facility in Chattanooga.Volkswagen wants slice of American pie AUSmotive.com The new facility is due to open in 2011.In addition to corporate business interests, there are many retail shops in Chattanooga, including two shopping malls: Northgate Mall in Hixson and Hamilton Place Mall in East Brainerd.Utilitieson the Tennessee River at Chattanooga]] Electric power for most of the city and surrounding area is provided by the city-run Electric Power Board (EPB), which also provides telephone and high-speed internet service to businesses in the downtown area. The TVA operates the nearby Sequoyah Nuclear Power Plant, Chickamauga Dam and the Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant all of which provide electricity to the greater Chattanooga area.Natural gas and water are provided by the privately run Chattanooga Gas Company and Tennessee-American Water Company, respectively. In 2005 Mayor Ron Littlefield stated his desire for the city to purchase the Tennessee-American Water Company,, which is being sold in a public offering in 2007. Former Mayor Jon Kinsey attempts to have the city buy control were defeated in court.Comcast is the cable provider for most areas of the city. The incumbent telephone company is AT&amp;T. However, competing phone companies, cellular phones and VoIP are beginning to make inroads. A major interstate fiber optics line operated by AT&amp;T traverses the city, making its way from Atlanta to Cincinnati.Politics, government and lawThe current mayor is Ron Littlefield Â®, a long-time city councilman, who was elected in a run-off election in April 2005.The city operates under a charter granted by the state legislature in 1852, as amended. As of 2005, the city operates with a strong mayor system.The city's legislative branch is split up into nine districts, with a council member for each district selected in partisan elections. The current council members are Linda Bennett (District 1), Sally Robinson (District 2), Dan Page (District 3), Jack Benson (District 4), John "Duke" Franklin (District 5), Carol Berz (District 6), Manuel "Manny" Rico (District 7), Leamon Pierce (District 8) and Debbie Gaines (District 9).Within the last ten years the city has won three national awards for outstanding "livability", and 9 Gunther Blue Ribbon Awards for excellence in housing and consolidated planning.City of Chattanooga&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;See also List of Mayors of Chattanooga, Tennessee.EducationPrimary and secondary educationMost of Chattanooga's primary and secondary education is funded by the government.

The city was gifted with a Carnegie library in 1904, and the two-story purpose-built marble structure survives to this day at Eighth Street and Georgia Avenue as commercial office space. In 1939, the library moved to Douglas Street and McCallie Avenue and shared the new building with the John Storrs Fletcher Library of the University of Chattanooga. This building is now called Fletcher Hall and houses classrooms and offices for the University. The city library was moved to its third and current location in 1976 at the corner of Tenth and Broad streets.Health careChattanooga's health care sector has three hospital systems.

The Norfolk Southern Railway's enormous DeButts Yard is just east of downtown, Shipp's Yard and CSX's Wauhatchie Yard are southwest of the city. Indeed, the two railroad companies are among the largest individual landowners in the city (the Federal Government is another). The Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, the largest historic operating railroad in the South, and the Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway also provides railroad service in Chattanooga.Since both NS and CSX both run through Chattanooga, here are the lines that run through the town (the AAR codes are used for the following railroads: NS for Norfolk Southern, CSXT for CSX Transportation, TNVR for Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, and CCKY for Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway):CSXT - Western &amp; Atlantic Subdivision (Chattanooga to Atlanta, Georgia)Chattanooga Subdivision (Chattanooga to Nashville, Tennessee on former NC&StL trackage)NS - Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific, aka the Queen and Crescent Route (Chattanooga to Cincinnati, Ohio via Lexington, Kentucky)Alabama Great Southern (Chattanooga to New Orleans, Louisiana via Birmingham, Alabama)Georgia Division (Chattanooga to Atlanta)Tennessee Division (Chattanooga to Knoxville, Tennessee)Chattanooga Traction CompanyNorth Chattanooga to Signal MountainDry Valley Line (Red Bank to Lupton City)TNVR - East Chattanooga to Grand Junction (3 miles)East Chattanooga Belt Line Railroad (from Debutts Yard and 17th Street, across to Holtzclaw Avenue and East Chattanooga, used by TNVR)CCKY - formerly the Tennessee Alabama &amp; Georgia line (Chattanooga to Hedges, Georgia)formerly the Central of Georgia line (Chattanooga to Lyerly, Georgia)Also, the Incline Railway, as well as being a tourist attraction, is sometimes used for commuting by Lookout Mountain residents, particularly during wintry weather, when travelling up and down the mountain could be very dangerous.Despite the relatively high level of freight rail activity, there is no passenger rail service in the city for either commuters or long-distance travelers.BridgesBeing bisected by a major waterway, Chattanooga has several large bridges over the Tennessee River. They are, from west to east:P.R. Olgiati Bridge â Named for a former mayor P.R. Olgiati, this bridge carries &quot;27&quot; from downtown to Dayton, Tennessee and points northward.Market Street Bridge - Officially called the John Ross Bridge. It is a bascule span which is a type of drawbridge. The bridge was completed in 1917 for the then-astronomical sum of USD$1,000,000. Having stood for decades since its last major overhaul, the Tennessee Department of Transportation declared it unsafe in late 2004. The bridge was closed in 2005 for a long-overdue renovation and reopened on August 4 2007.Market Street Bridge Project // What's Happening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Walnut Street Bridge â Also known as "The Walking Bridge", it is one of the centerpieces of Chattanooga's urban renewal, and is the second longest pedestrian bridge in the nation. Over 115 years old, the bridge was declared unsafe and closed to traffic in 1978. It was on the verge of being demolished in the late 1980s when public demand led to it being restored as a pedestrian-only span that opened in 1993.Veterans Memorial Bridge â Installed in the mid 1980s, this structure has helped commuters from Hixson, Lupton City and other northern areas reach downtown quickly.C.B. Robinson Bridge â This route carries Dupont Parkway from Amnicola Highway to Hixson Pike and Route 153.Tennessee River Railroad Bridge â Also called "Tennbridge," this truss bridge with a vertical lift carries the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway over the river and is a popular railfan area.Wilkes T. Thrasher Bridge â Carries Highway 153 over Chickamauga Dam.Air TravelChattanooga is served by Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport at Lovell Field. Located east of the city, Lovell Field is served by several regional and national airlines, offering non-stop service to various domestic destinations. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL) is 125 miles southeast of Chattanooga, the Nashville International Airport (BNA) is 133 miles northwest of Chattanooga, and the Birmingham International Airport (BHM) is 145 miles southwest of the city. Certain flights to and from Chattanooga have been known to be cancelled due to a lack of passengers on a particular flight so it is important to know of other regional options.Media and communicationsThe city of Chattanooga is served by numerous local, regional and national media outlets which reach approximately 1,000,000 people in four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina.NewspapersThe Chattanooga Times Free Press, the area's only daily newspaper, is published each morning. It was effectively formed in 1999 from two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century. The Times was once owned by Adolph Ochs, who then also bought the New York Times. The Times had been the morning paper with a generally liberal editorial page. The News-Free Press, whose name was the result of an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the Times. In 1999, the Free Press was bought by an Arkansas company, WEHCO Media, publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which then bought The Times from the Ochs heirs. Though the two newspapers have merged, the new paper runs both editorial pages, a liberal page and a conservative page, the liberal page being on the left side and the conservative one on the right side, which is unique among all major newspapers in the United States.Free alternative weekly papers in the city include The Chattanooga Pulse and The Enigma.RadioRadio stations in Chattanooga include:AM---WUUS 980 AM - Oldies / U 97.3/99.3 (Simulcast with WUUS-FM 97.3) (Licensed to Rossville, GA)WFLI 1070 AM - Southern gospel (Licensed to Lookout Mountain, TN)WGOW 1150 AM - News/talk / NewsRadio 1150 http://wgow.com/amWNOO 1260 AM - Urban gospel and MotownWDOD 1310 AM - Oldies / Ruby 1310WDEF-AM 1370 AM - Sports/talk/ 1370 ESPN Radio http://espn.go.com affiliate.FM---WUTC 88.1 FM - NPR http://www.npr.org/Mixed music / Music 88.
