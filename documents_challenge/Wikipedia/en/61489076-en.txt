The Shooting guard (SG), also known as the two or off guard, - BBC Sports academy URL last accessed 2006-09-09 is one of five traditional positions on a basketball team. Players of the position are often shorter, leaner, and quicker than forwards. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for his team. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. Jamal Crawford, for example, is a shooting guard who is more of a playmaker than a shooter. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. An example would be Kobe Bryant.Characteristics and styles of playThe Basketball Handbook by Lee Rose describes a shooting guard as someone whose primary role is to score points. Typically, shooting guards are taller than point guards and more athletic. Size at the position varies; most shooting guards in the professional game are between 6 ft 3 and 6 ft 9 inches or 1.91 to 2.06 m. Many bigger shooting guards also play small forward. While they are usually the best jump-shooters on the floor, some shooting guards (such as Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Ben Gordon, Kobe Bryant, Jason Richardson, Tracy McGrady, and Dwyane Wade) are known for attacking the basket. Shooting guards should be good ball handlers and be able to pass reasonably well, though passing is not their main priority. Since good shooting guards may attract double-teams, they are frequently the team's back-up ball handlers to the point guard.List of active NBA shooting guardsRay Allen, Boston CelticsRaja Bell, Phoenix SunsKobe Bryant, Los Angeles LakersKevin Durant, Oklahoma City ThunderAnthony Parker, Toronto RaptorsManu Ginobili, San Antonio SpursBen Gordon, Chicago BullsWillie Green, Philadelphia 76ersRichard Hamilton, Detroit PistonsEddie House, Boston CelticsJoe Johnson, Atlanta HawksKevin Martin, Sacramento KingsO.
