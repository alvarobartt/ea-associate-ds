  [[Image:Mannheim-Wasserturm-2005-06-26.jpg|thumb|Wasserturm (water tower), Mannheim's landmark.]] Mannheim is a city in Germany. With 327,318 inhabitants it is the second-largest city in the state of Baden-Württemberg after the capital Stuttgart.Mannheim is situated at the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Neckar, in the northwestern corner of the state of Baden-Württemberg. The Rhine separates Mannheim from the adjacent Rhineland-Palatinate city of Ludwigshafen. The Hessian border is north of the city. Mannheim is the largest city of the Rhine Neckar Area, a metropolitan area with 2.4 million inhabitants.Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its central area is laid out in a grid pattern (called Quadrate, squares), much like many North American cities. The main route through the squares leads to an enormous 18th-century palace. This former seat of the Electors of the Palatinate now houses the University of Mannheim.Mannheim's city symbol is the Wasserturm (water tower), located in the east of the city centre.Mannheim is the largest producer of Submarines for the German U-Boot fleetHistoryMannheim is first mentioned in a document from 766, the "Codex Laureshamensis" from the Lorsch Cloister. It is listed as "Mannenheim" (Home of Manno). It remained a village until Frederick IV, Elector Palatine initiated building the fortress Friedrichsburg and the adjacent grid-like city core in 1606. On 24 January1607 he gave Mannheim city privileges.The city was destroyed subsequently in the Thirty Years' War in 1622 by Tilly's troops, and in the Nine Years War for the Palatinate succession in 1689 by the French.After the rebuilding since 1698, the capital of the Electoral Palatinate was transferred from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720. It was then that Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine began construction of the Mannheim Palace and the Jesuit Church. They were completed in 1760.In the 18th century, Mannheim was home to the so-called Mannheim School of classical composers. It was reputed to have one of the best court orchestras in Europe under the leadership of Carlo Grua. The court left Mannheim in 1778 and two decades later, Mannheim was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1802.In 1819 Norwich Duff made the following observations: Mannheim is in the Duchy of Baden and situated at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar over both of which there is a bridge of boats. This is the third town of this name having been twice burnt. The houses are large, and the streets broad and at right angles to each other, and is one of the most airy clean towns I have seen in Germany. It was formerly fortified but the fortifications were rased in 1806 and gardens fill their places. There is a large Chateau here belonging to the Grand Duke and a very good garden; part of the Chateau was destroyed when the town was bombarded and has never since been repaired, the other part is occupied by the Grand Duchess widow of the late Grand Duke who was succeeded by his Uncle having left only three daughters. She is the sister of Eugene Beauharnais presumably she was born [[Hortense de Beauharnais] daughter by her former marriage of Napoleon Buonaparte's Empress Josephine]. There is a Cathedral, a Theatre which is considered good, an observatory, a gallery of pictures at the Chateau and some private collections. About 2 km (1 mile) below the town the Russian Army crossed the Rhine in 1813. Population 18 300.InventionsSome important inventions were made in Mannheim.Karl Drais built the first two-wheeled draisine in 1817.Carl Benz' first car appeared on the streets of Mannheim in 1886. At his workshop in Mannheim he produced a lightweight three-wheeled vehicle powered by a single cylinder petrol/gasoline-fueled engine, first shown in public around 1886. This powered tricycle subsequently came to be widely regarded as the original automobile/motor car.The Lanz Bulldog, a popular tractor with a rugged, simple Diesel engine was introduced in 1921.Julius Hatry built the world's first rocket plane in 1929.World War IIDuring World War II, Mannheim (as a key industrial center) was heavily damaged by U.S. and British bombing. The inner city area was practically annihilated.The purpose of the British strategic bombing campaign was to kill as many enemy civilians as possible, breaking their morale through this terror and thus causing a surrender.http://books.google.com/books?id=IrAzsxzjIooC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=Spaight+bombing+vindicated&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=g9rLxzD_r0vjxT5HLiBAAueiYyE The first deliberate "terror bombing" of German civilians was the December 16, 1940 bombing of Mannheim.http://books.google.com/books?id=8J2-kzMxbKYC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;dq=%22Germany+and+the+Second+World+War%22+%22deliberate+terror%22+Mannheim&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=bFzGao4uHyptBHQTiDx0y1DzXWgThe city was occupied by the U.S. Army on March 291945.

The U.S. Army has already closed installations in Mannheim such as Gendarmerie Kaserne in Schönau, the NATO bunker in Feudenheim and Turley Barracks in Wohlgelegen.TransportationThe Mannheim/Ludwigshafen area is surrounded by a ring of motorways connecting it to Frankfurt in the north, Karlsruhe in the south, Saarbrücken in the west and Nürnberg in the east.Mannheim Hauptbahnhof (central station) is at the end of the Mannheim-Stuttgart high-speed rail line and is the most important railway junction in the southwest of Germany, served by ICE high-speed train system with connections to Frankfurt am Main / Berlin, Karlsruhe / Basel and Stuttgart / Munich. Mannheim Harbour is the second largest river port in Germany.The establishment of the RheinNeckar S-Bahn on 2003 connected nearly all of the Rhine-Neckar area, including lines into the Palatinate, Odenwald and southern Hesse. All S-Bahn lines run through Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. Further S-Bahn stations are at present Mannheim-Rangierbahnhof, Mannheim-Seckenheim and Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld-Süd.Local public transport in Mannheim include eleven tram lines and numerous bus lines operated by Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr (Rhine-Neckar transport). Metre-gauge trams are operated in Mannheim by the MVV Verkehr AG and in Ludwigshafen by the Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen am Rhein and run through on each other tracks. In addition the Oberrheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (OEG), operates interurban trams on a triangular route between Mannheim, Heidelberg and Weinheim and the Rhein-Haardtbahn operates interurban trams between Bad Dürkheim, Ludwigshafen and Mannheim, both also running on MVV tracks. In the 1970s a proposal to build a U-Bahn out of the Mannheim and Ludwigshafen tramways was begun, but only small sections were in fact built due to lack of funds. The only underground station in Mannheim is the Haltestelle Dalbergstraße. U-Bahn planning has now stopped. All public transport is offered at uniform prices set by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar transport union, VRN).Although Frankfurt International Airport is only 65 km north, since 2004 there have been daily passenger flights from Mannheim City Airport (IATA code MHG) to Berlin, Hamburg and Saarbrücken.Sport)]]Mannheim hosted the 2007 European Show Jumping ChampionshipsFEI European Jumping Championship, Mannheim 14 - 19 August, in the MVV-riding stadium.
