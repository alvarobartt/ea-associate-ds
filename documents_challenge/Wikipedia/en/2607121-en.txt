As a consequence it has faced prolonged financial difficulties since its inception.UPR's candidates commenced their political campaign from the conservative-liberal organisation Janusz Korwin-Mikke's Platform ("Platforma Janusza Korwin-Mikke"). The PJKM did not manage to cross the required 5% threshold in the 2005 parliamentary elections (the party had the support of only 1.57% of voters).In the most recent election, UPR's candidates campaigned in cooperation with the League of Polish Families but did not enter into a formal coalition.The list on which both the UPR and the Leage appeared saw the UPR garnering 1.5% votes. This was insufficient to get any of their candidates into the Lower House ("Sejm") and therefore the UPR remains unable to obtain public funding.LeadershipJanusz Korwin-Mikke (1990-1997)Stanisław Michalkiewicz (1997-1999)Janusz Korwin-Mikke (1999-2003)Stanisław Wojtera (2003-2005)Jacek Boroń (2005)Wojciech Popiela (2005-2008)Bolesław Witczak (2008-...)Party symbolA special colour variation of St George's Cross is used here as a traditional symbol of a struggle for principles.
