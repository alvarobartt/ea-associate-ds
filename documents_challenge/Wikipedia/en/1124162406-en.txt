It lies on the A3 motorway.There are two sections of the city. Falerna Scala, the oldest section, lies atop a set of sheer cliffs. Falerna Marina is situated on the seashore and boasts a fine beach and several hotels.Many of Falerna's sons and daughters emigrated to the United States, in particular western Pennsylvania, and a few have returned to their home town in retirement. Older residents speak a distinct dialect of Italian known as Falernese. It is dying out as media and schools continue to standardize the Italian language throughout the nation.External linksPro Loco website (tourist association)Notes and references  Category:Cities and towns in Calabriacs:Falerna de:Falerna es:Falerna eo:Falerna fr:Falerna it:Falerna hu:Falerna nl:Falerna ja:ファレルナ nap:Falerna pl:Falerna pt:Falerna scn:Falerna (CZ) vo:Falerna
