See Harmonic series (music) for the (related) musical concept.In mathematics, the harmonic series is the infinite series\sum_^\infty \frac = 1 + \frac + \frac + \frac + \cdots.\!Its name derives from the concept of overtones, or harmonics, in music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc., of the string's fundamental wavelength. Every term of the series after the first is the harmonic mean of the neighboring terms; the term harmonic mean likewise derives from music.Divergence of the harmonic seriesThe harmonic series diverges, albeit rather slowly, to infinity (the first 1043 terms sum to less than 100 On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences A082912). One way to prove this divergence is by noting that the harmonic series is term-by-term larger than or equal to another divergent series:\begin \sum_^\infty \frac &  = 1 + \left\frac\right + \left+ \frac\right + \left+ \frac + \frac + \frac\right + \left\frac+\cdots\right +\cdots \\ &   1 + \left\frac\right + \left+ \frac\right + \left+ \frac + \frac + \frac\right + \left\frac+\cdots\right +\cdots \\ &  = 1 + \ \frac\ \ \ + \quad \frac \ \quad + \ \qquad\quad\frac\qquad\ \quad \ + \quad \ \ \frac \ \quad +\cdots. \end The sum of infinitely many "1/2"s clearly diverges to infinity and therefore the harmonic series also diverges. More precisely, if s_ is the 2k-th partial sum of the harmonic series, thens_ \ge 1 + , which clearly diverges, although slowly (at a logarithmic rate). This proof, due to Nicole Oresme, is a high point of medieval mathematics. It is still a standard proof taught in mathematics classes today.Another proof uses the integral test for convergence, relating the harmonic series to the (divergent) integral of 1/''x'' over the interval from 1 to infinity.Even the sum of the reciprocals of just the prime numbers diverges to infinity, although at an exponentially slower rate; known proofs of this fact are much more difficult.Convergence of the alternating harmonic seriesThe alternating harmonic series converges:\sum_^\infty \frac = 1 - \frac + \frac - \frac + \cdots = \ln 2 = 0.6931471806\dots\,. This equality is a consequence of the Mercator series, the Taylor series for the natural logarithm. Another equality, similar in form to Mercator's series, is:\sum_^\infty \frac = 1 - \frac + \frac -\frac +\cdots = \arctan (1 )=\frac.\!  This is a consequence of the Taylor series representation of the inverse tangent function (which has a radius of convergence of 1).Partial sumsThe ''n''th partial sum of the diverging harmonic series,H_n = \sum_^n \frac,\!is called the n''th 'harmonic number'''.The difference between the n''th harmonic number and the natural logarithm of ''n converges to the Euler-Mascheroni constant.The difference between distinct harmonic numbers is never an integer.Jeffrey Lagarias proved in 2001 that the Riemann hypothesis is logically equivalent to the statement\sigma(n)\le H_n + \ln(H_n)e^ \qquad \textn \in \mathbb, \! where &sigma;(n'') stands for the sum of the positive divisors of ''n.An Elementary Problem Equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis, American Mathematical Monthly, volume 109 (2002), pages 534--543.General harmonic seriesThe general harmonic series is of the form\sum_^\frac.\!All general harmonic series diverge.''P''-seriesThe p-series is (any of) the series\sum_^\frac,\!for any positive real number p''. The series is always convergent if ''p  1 (in which case it is called the over-harmonic series) and divergent otherwise. When p'' = 1, the series is the harmonic series. If ''p  1 then the sum of the series is &zeta;(p''), i.e., the Riemann zeta function evaluated at ''p.Random harmonic seriesByron Schmuland of the University of Alberta examined"Random Harmonic Series", American Mathematical Monthly 110, 407-416, May 2003[http://www.stat.ualberta.ca/people/schmu/preprints/rhs.pdf Schmuland's preprint of Random Harmonic Series] the properties of the random harmonic series\sum_^\frac,\!where the s''''n are independent, identically distributed random variables taking the values +1 and &minus;1 with equal probability 1/2. He shows that this sum converges with probability 1 and that the convergent is a random variable with some interesting properties. In particular, the probability density function of this random variable evaluated at +2 or at &minus;2 takes on the value 0.124&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;7642&nbsp;..., differing from 1/8 by less than 10&minus;42. Schmuland's paper explains why this probability is so close to, but not exactly, 1/8.Depleted harmonic series The depleted harmonic series where all of the terms with a 9 in the denominator are removed can be shown to converge and its value is less than 80.Nick's Mathematical Puzzles: Solution 72&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In fact when terms containing any particular string of digits are removed the series converges.See alsoComplex logarithmHarmonic numberRiemann zeta functionMany proofs of divergence of harmonic series : "The Harmonic Series Diverges Again and Again", The AMATYC Review, 27 (2006), pp. 31-43.NotesCategory:Divergent series Category:Mathematical seriesca:Sèrie harmònica da:Harmonisk række de:Harmonische Reihe es:Serie armónica (matemática) fr:Série harmonique is:Umhverfuröð it:Serie armonica he:הסדרה ההרמונית nl:Harmonische rij ja:調和級数 pl:Szereg harmoniczny pt:Série harmónica (matemática) ru:Гармонический ряд sl:Harmonična vrsta fi:Harmoninen sarja sv:Harmoniska serien zh:调和级数
