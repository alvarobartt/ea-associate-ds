Its football team is in Liga VitalisBeira-Mar plays in a football stadium built for the 2004 European Football Championship called Estádio Municipal de Aveiro.Its best known players of all times were Eusébio (who played for the team during the 1976/77 season) and António Sousa. Both tasted glory with Portugal national football team.Sports departmentsSport Beira-Mar was founded on January,1, 1922 in Aveiro. Beira-Mar is most known for its renowned futsal, basketball, and boxing departments. Football is also a growing spot in the club, with the club being a regular participant in the highest division of Portuguese football, nowadays called BWINLIGA.FootballBeira-Mar's best season in the league was in 1990/91 . The biggest feat in the club's history was winning the Portuguese Football Cup in the 1998/99 season, and achieving its final in 1990/91. The club also won the Taça Ribeiro dos Reis in 1964/65 and won the 2nd Division, three times, in 1960/61; 1964/65; 1970/71. The club also won the Liga de Honra in 2005/06. Beira Mar participated in the Uefa Cup in the 1999/2000 season being beaten by Vitesse of Holland 2-1.Eusébio DaysBack in the 1960s Eusébio was an icon to Portugal and Benfica fans. But in 1976 many Beira Mar fans were skeptical if Eusebio could still play the way he did 10 years prior, they soon found out as Eusebio soon registered 3 goals in 12 games a feat for a player his age.The Portuguese CupWithout a doubt, the biggest feat in Beira-Mar's history was the Portuguese Football Cup in the 1998/99 season, when the team was managed by António Sousa, a former player of the club, who also played for F.C. Porto and the national squad. The lone goal in the final against Campomaiorense was scored by Ricardo Sousa, his son. Unfortunately, the club was relegated to the Liga de Honra that same year. This was the second time the club reached the competition final, the first one was in 1990/91, when it lost to FC Porto.Aveiro StadiumEstádio Municipal de Aveiro is a football (soccer) stadium in Aveiro, Portugal. It was designed for Euro 2004 by the architect Tomás Taveira. It is very colorful and festive-looking. It seats 30,498 people. It is the home to the football club of SC Beira-Mar. Many Beira-Mar fans call it the Circus for its' intense design. The question of who actually owns the stadium, the club or the municipality of Aveiro, has caused many tensions between the two entities, endangering the funding of the club.Mário JardelThe return of Mário Jardel to Portugal to play in Beira Mar was one of the biggest news in the Portuguese football in the summer of 2006. It lifted many of Beira-Mar's fans hopes that the club would not get relegated with the Brazilian scorer who won the European boot on several occasions (Which is given to the Top Scorer in Europe). He scored in his debut game, a 2-2 draw against Desportivo das Aves. However, with Beira-Mar struggling in the Liga, Jardel transferred to Anorthosis Famagusta in the winter transfer market.Fans of Beira-MarThe fans of Beira-Mar are known as "Auri-negros" (Yellow-Blacks).Notable Players Eusébio Antonio Sousa Ricardo Sousa Andy Marriott Paul Murray Stephen McPhee Magdi Abdelghani Todor Kiutchoukov Mariano Fernández José Carlos da Silva Antolin Alcaraz Marian Zemen Mário Jardel Kingsley Sunny Ekeh Clyde Wijnhard Faye Fary  Fernando Aguiar Jorge Leitao Pavel Srníček Mourtala Diakité Edgar Bruno da Silva Andrija Delibasic TininhoCurrent squad''As of 22 October, 2007                          Squad changes 2007/08 seasonIn: Luis Almeida - from Crac Mato Grosso Litos - from Ribeirão Fernando Campagnolo - from Naval 1º Maio Camora - back from loan at Pampilhosa Vitor Alves - from C.F.
