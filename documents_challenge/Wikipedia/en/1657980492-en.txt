Mitea is a left-winger renowned for his dribbling ability and fast pace.Mitea started his professional carrier in the Romanian Divizia A, playing for FC Dinamo Bucureşti in the 2002-03 season. After having played only 9 matches in the Romanian league, he was picked up by Dutch club Ajax after he impressed on a trial.Before he left he and Dinamo won the Cupa României. His first season at Ajax was a success as he, at the tender age of 18, played 23 matches and scored 7 goals in the Dutch Eredivisie and in the process winning the league title with Ajax.This period also saw him making his debut for the Romanian national team on August 20, 2003. The 2004-2005 season proved more difficult, as Mitea struggled to find the back of the net and only scored twice during that season. He performed very well on the Romanian youth team and became more interesting for the national team.2005 was his breakthrough year in the national team, as he played 4 matches that year in which he scored twice. He established himself as a more important player for the team as well. His development in his career was set on hold due to a knee injury which sidelined him for a long time, resulting in only one appearance for Ajax in the 2005-06 season. Also in the following season Mitea did not play regularly as manager Henk ten Cate choose to overlook him and he was no longer first choice for the left-wing position. Despite the lack of appearances in these two seasons he did add two KNVB Cups to his list of trophies.Due to minor injuries and still being out of favour with Henk Ten Cate, and then temporary replacement coach Adrie Koster, Mitea did not play a single game for Ajax during the 2007-08 season. Unsurprisingly, new coach Marco Van Basten does not have any plans for Mitea for the 2008-09 season and the young Romanian has been told he can look for new club.He came back to Dinamo Bucureşti in August 2008 signing a 4 year contract.StatisticsSeasonClubCompetitionAppsGoals2002/03FC Dinamo BucureştiROM Divizia A902003/04Ajax]]NED Eredivisie2372004/05Ajax]]NED Eredivisie2122005/06Ajax]]NED Eredivisie102006/07Ajax]]NED Eredivisie822007/08Ajax]]NED Eredivisie00Total6211External links Voetbal International profile Official Ajax Profile Mitea's page at romaniansoccer.roReferencesVoetbal International website and 2007/2008 presentation magazine Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Romania international footballers Category:Romanian footballers Category:People from Bucharest Category:Dinamo Bucureşti players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Liga I playersde:Nicolae Mitea es:Nicolae Mitea fr:Nicolae Mitea it:Nicolae Mitea nl:Nicolae Mitea ja:ニコラエ・ミテア pl:Nicolae Mitea pt:Nicolae Mitea ru:Митя, Николае ro:Nicolae Mitea fi:Nicolae Mitea
