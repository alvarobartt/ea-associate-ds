According to drummer Lars Ulrich: "this album and what we're doing with it - that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking die."http://www.metallicaworld.co.uk/Interviews/1996_pretty_hate_machine.htm&lt;/ref&gt;To date, the album has sold over 5 million copies in America,http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=4&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=Metallica&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25&lt;/ref&gt; and is certified Gold in the UK, having sold over 100,000 copies.http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&amp;r_id=21427&lt;/ref&gt;HistoryReleased approximately five years after the international smash success, Metallica, Load saw the band embrace a collective sound and identity closer to traditional heavy metal and different from their thrash metal roots. As on previous releases, the fourteen songs that would eventually make up the album began as rough demos created by principal songwriters James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich in Ulrich's basement recording studio, "The Dungeon." The band took over 30 demos into The Plant Studios in the spring of 1995 where they would work for approximately the next year. Once again, Metallica teamed up with famed producer Bob Rock, who had been at the helm during the recording process for Metallica.The songwriting dispenses almost entirely with the thrash metal style that characterized the band's sound in the 1980s. In place of staccato riffs, Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett experimented with more blues-based tones and styles. Additionally, Ulrich adopted a minimalist approach to his drum recording, abandoning the speed and complex double bass patterns of previous albums. Hetfield displayed a lyrical evolution as well, writing what many feel to be his most personal and introspective lyrics. "Until it Sleeps," the album's lead single, addressed his mother's losing battle with cancer, and "Mama Said" also explored his relationship with his mother. All of this marked a departure from the political and social overtones of albums like ...And Justice for All and Master of Puppets.The album also marked the first appearance of a new Metallica logo, rounding off the stabbing edges of the first and last letters of the band's earlier 1980s logo. The M from the original logo was used to make a shuriken-like symbol known as the "ninja star" which was used as an alternate logo on this and future albums as well as other related artwork. The album featured an expansive booklet which contained many photos of the band. The booklet only contained select lyrics from each song in contrast to Metallica's previous studio albums which included complete song lyrics. Additionally, the interior artwork revolved around images of inkblots, a theme which would carry over to ReLoad and the covers for the singles released from the two albums.The cover of the album is original artwork entitled "Semen and Blood III." It is one of three photographic studies by Andres Serrano created in 1990 by mingling the artist's own semen and bovine blood between two sheets of Plexiglas.Semen &amp; Blood II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;At 78:59 minutes, this was Metallica's longest studio album. Initial pressings of the album were affixed with stickers that boasted its long playtime, simply reading "78:59.""The Outlaw Torn" had to be shortened by about one minute to fit on the album. The full version was released on a single for "The Memory Remains" as "The Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions Version)" with a running time of 10:46. An explanation was given on the single's back cover: This was also the only Metallica studio album on which the band's bassist (Jason Newsted for this album) did not have a writing credit. It was also their first album for all tracks to be drop-tuned a half-step; they had, however, previously tuned down on Master of Puppets on "The Thing That Should Not Be," and on The Black Album on "The God That Failed" and "Sad But True", and some cover songs, after that album, including the Motorhead songs that they covered before recording Load.ReceptionProfessional reviews:Rolling Stone (7/11-25/1996, p.85) - 4 Stars - Excellent - "...with Load, the foursome dams the bombast and chugs half-speed ahead, settling into a wholly magnetizing groove that bridges old-school biker rock and the doomier side of post-grunge '90s rock."Entertainment Weekly (6/7/96, pp.56-57) - "...captures the band's earnest pursuit of its Sisyphean mission: to create hard rock that reaches grown-ups and basement-dwelling teens." - Rating: B''Q'' magazine (7/96, p.119) - 4 Stars - Excellent - "These boys set up their tents in the darkest place of all, in the naked horror of their own heads....Metallica make existential metal and they've never needed the props....Metallica are still awesome....What is new is streamlined attack, the focus and, yes, the tunes."Melody Maker (6/8/96, p.49) - "A Metallica album is traditionally an exhausting event. It should rock you to exhaustion, leave you brutalised and drained. This one is no exception. It is, however, the first Metallica album to make me wonder at any point, 'What the f*** was that?' It's as if the jackboot grinding the human face were to take occasional breaks for a pedicure."''Musician'' (8/96, p.85) - "The smoother, broader sound that distinguished...1991's METALLICA is even more apparent here, as is the tendency to write accessible tunes....the exploration of new sounds does nothing but good for the guitar duo of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett."New York Times (6/2/96, Sec.2, p.28) - "On Load, Metallica has altered its music, learning new skills. Hetfield has committed himself to melodies, carrying tunes where he used to bark, and he no longer sounds sheepish when he sings quietly."NME (6/1/96, p.44) - 7 (out of 10) - "...like triumphant warriors returning into a world changed beyond all recognition...Metallica emphatically prove they are still unsurpassed in their self-created genre of stadium nihilism."Track listingPersonnelJames Hetfield – lead vocals, rhythm guitarKirk Hammett – lead guitarJason Newsted – bass, backing vocalsLars Ulrich – drumsProductionBob Rock, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich – producersBrian Dobbs, Randy Staub – engineersBrian Dobbs, Jason Goldstein, Kent Matcke – assistant engineersMike Rew, Randy Staub – mixingCurry – mixing assistantGeorge Marino – masteringPaul DeCarli – digital editingMike Gillies, Chris Vrenna – digital editing assistantsChris Vrenna – programmingAndie Airfix – designAndres Serrano – cover designAnton Corbijn – photographyChartsAlbumYearChartPosition1996Billboard 2001UK Album ChartsARIA]] Albums ChartSinglesYearSingleChartPosition1996"Ain't My Bitch"Mainstream Rock Tracks151996"Hero of the Day"Mainstream Rock Tracks11996"Hero of the Day"UK Singles Chart171996"Hero of the Day"The Billboard Hot 100601996"Until It Sleeps"Mainstream Rock Tracks11996"Until It Sleeps"Modern Rock Tracks271996"Until It Sleeps"The Billboard Hot 100101996"Until It Sleeps"UK Singles Chart51996"Mama Said"ARIA Singles Chart241997"Ain't My Bitch"Mainstream Rock Tracks401997"Bleeding Me"Mainstream Rock Tracks61997"Hero of the Day"Canadian Singles Chart171997"King Nothing"Canadian Singles Chart141997"King Nothing"Mainstream Rock Tracks61997"King Nothing"The Billboard Hot 10090CertificationCountrySalesCertificationUnited States4,991,0005x PlatinumReferences    Category:Metallica albums Category:1996 albums Category:Elektra Records albums Category:Heavy metal albums Category:Hard rock albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Rockbg:Load cs:Load (album) da:Load de:Load (Album) et:Load (Metallica) es:Load fr:Load (album) it:Load he:Load hu:Load nl:Load no:Load (album) pl:Load pt:Load ro:Load ru:Load simple:Load (album) sk:Load (album) fi:Load sv:Load
