Hazlewood's collaborations with Nancy Sinatra as well as his solo output in the late 1960s and early 1970s have been praised as an essential contribution to a sound often described as "Cowboy Psychedelia" or "Saccharine Underground".CareerThe son of an oil man, Hazlewood was born in Mannford, Oklahoma and spent most of youth living between Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Louisiana. Hazlewood spent his teenage years in Port Neches, Texas where he was exposed to a rich Gulf Coast music tradition. Hazlewood studied for a medical degree at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He served with the United States Army during the Korean War.Following discharge from the military, Hazlewood worked as a disc jockey while honing his songwriting skills. His first hit as a producer and songwriter was "The Fool", recorded by rockabilly artist Sanford Clark in 1956. Hazlewood partnered with pioneering rock guitarist Duane Eddy., producing and cowriting an unprecedented string of hit instrumental records, including "Peter Gunn", "Boss Guitar", "40 Miles Of Bad Road", "Shazam!", "Rebel Rouser" and "With The Guitar Man".Hazlewood is perhaps best known for having written and produced the 1966 Nancy Sinatra U.S./U.K. #1 hit, "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'". He also wrote "How Does That Grab Ya, Darlin'" and "Sugar Town" for Sinatra. He also wrote "Houston", a 1965 U.S. hit recorded by Dean Martin.In the 1970s Hazlewood moved to Stockholm, Sweden, where he wrote and produced the one-hour television show Cowboy in Sweden, which also later emerged as an album.Hazlewood was semi-retired from the music business during the 1970s and '80s. However, his own output also achieved a cult status in the underground rock scene, with songs covered by artists such as Vanilla Fudge, Lydia Lunch, Primal Scream, Entombed, Einstürzende Neubauten, Nick Cave, Hooverphonic, Anita Lane, Megadeth, Beck, Boyd Rice,Thin White Rope and Slowdive.In 2006, Hazlewood sang on Bela B.'s first solo album, Bingo, on the song "Lee Hazlewood und das erste Lied des Tages" ("Lee Hazlewood and the first song of the day").In 2005 he was diagnosed with terminal renal cancer, yet undertook an extensive round of interviews and promotional activities in support of his last album, Cake or Death.His last recording was for the vocals of Icelandic quartet Amiina's single "Hilli (At The Top Of The World)".Hazlewood died of renal cancer in Henderson, Nevada on August 4, 2007, survived by his wife Jeane, son Mark and daughters Debbie and Samantha.Discography1960s-1970s 1963 &mdash; Trouble Is a Lonesome Town1964 &mdash; N.S.V.I.P.1965 &mdash; Friday's Child1966 &mdash; The Very Special World of Lee Hazlewood1967 &mdash; Lee Hazlewoodism Its Cause and Cure1968 &mdash; Nancy and Lee &mdash; a collaboration with Nancy Sinatra1968 &mdash; Something Special1968 &mdash; Love and Other Crimes1969 &mdash; The Cowboy and the Lady &mdash; a collaboration with Ann Margret.1969 &mdash; Forty1970 &mdash; Cowboy in Sweden &mdash; recorded in Sweden1971 &mdash; Requiem for an Almost Lady1972 &mdash; Nancy and Lee Again &mdash; a collaboration with Nancy Sinatra1972 &mdash; 131973 &mdash; I'll Be Your Baby Tonight (Written by Bob Dylan)1973 &mdash; Poet, Fool or Bum1974 &mdash; The Stockholm Kid Live at Berns1975 &mdash; A House Safe for Tigers1976 &mdash; 20th Century Lee1977 &mdash; Movin' On1977 &mdash; Back on the Street Again1990s-2000s 1993 &mdash; Gypsies & Indians &mdash; a collaboration with Anna Hanski1999 &mdash; Farmisht, Flatulence, Origami, ARF!!! & Me...2002 &mdash; For Every Solution There's a Problem2002 &mdash; For Every Question There's an Answer &mdash; interview CD2002 &mdash; Bootleg Dreams & Counterfeit Demos2003 &mdash; Lycanthrope Tour/Europe 20022004 &mdash; Nancy & Lee 3 &mdash; a collaboration with Nancy Sinatra2006 &mdash; Lee Hazlewood & das erste Lied des Tages ("Lee Hazlewood & the first song of the day") with Bela B.2006 &mdash; Cake or DeathReferencesExternal linksThe Worldwide Fansite of Lee Hazlewoodtheage.com.au - 'Requiem for a pop hit master'NewYorkNightTrain.com Lee Hazlewood obituary and record guideObituary and TributeUnedited Lee Hazlewood Audio 2006Unedited Lee Hazlewood Video 2006[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/06/db0601.xml The Daily Telegraph Obituary][http://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2007/08/lee-hazlewood-radioman.html Arcane Radio trivia Radio Biography]  Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American country singers Category:American male singers Category:American record producers Category:Mercury Records artists Category:Oklahoma musicians Category:Jamie Records artists Category:1929 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Deaths from kidney cancer Category:People from Creek County, Oklahoma Category:People from the Beaumont-Port Arthur metropolitan area Category:American military personnel of the Korean War Category:Cancer deaths in Nevadada:Lee Hazlewood de:Lee Hazlewood es:Lee Hazlewood fr:Lee Hazlewood is:Lee Hazlewood it:Lee Hazlewood he:לי הייזלווד nl:Lee Hazlewood no:Lee Hazlewood pl:Lee Hazlewood ru:Хезлвуд, Бартон Ли simple:Lee Hazlewood fi:Lee Hazlewood sv:Lee Hazlewood
