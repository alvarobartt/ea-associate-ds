Interstate 68 runs through the city in an east/west direction. U.S. Highway 220 runs north/south.The majority of the land within the city lies in a valley created by the junction of the previously mentioned streams. Parts of Wills Mountain, Haystack Mountain and Shriver Ridge are also within the city limits. Cumberland is situated at the entrance to Cumberland Narrows, a natural gateway carved by Wills Creek through the Allegheny Mountains west to the Ohio River Valley.The abandoned Chesapeake and Ohio Canal has its Western Terminus here, and it is possible to travel by foot or on bike from here to Washington, D.C. along the canal towpath - a distance of roughly .According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.1&nbsp;square miles (23.5&nbsp;km²), of which, 9.1&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (23.5&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.11% is water.This was the terminus, and namesake, of the Cumberland Road.Neighborhoods and surrounding areas North End is a neighborhood in Cumberland bounded by Wills Creek to the south, Frederick Street to the East, and the city line on the west and north. Once known as "The Queen City", the neighborhood is a mix of residential, industrial, and commercial buildings. Some of the large industries found in this neighborhood include breweries, glass factories, and tanneries. These industries are now defunct, although many of the industrial buildings are still used for warehousing.Most of the residential housing stock in North End was constructed to house industrial workers, and date from the middle and late 19th century. The housing stock is characterized by adjoining brick rowhouses and duplexes, set on small lots with narrow streets. As you move east to west through the neighborhood, the house lots become larger, the streets wider, and the housing stock more recent. Due to the age of the housing stock, many North End streets contain large numbers of vacant and deteriorating buildings. This neighborhood has been targeted by the City Government for housing rehabilitation and blight removal. Most of the commercial businesses in North End are located on Mechanic and Centre streets. Included among them are convenience stores, restaurants, car dealerships, and small boutiques.South Cumberland, also known as South End, is the largest neighborhood in Cumberland both geographically and by population. It is bounded by the CSX mainline to the south, Williams Street to the north, the Potomac River to the west, and the city line to the east. The neighborhood is historically and currently a mix of residential, industrial, and commercial buildings.The residential character of the neighborhood is highly varied. Much of the housing stock in the area around Virginia Ave dates from the late 19th and early 20th century and was constructed to house workers from the neighborhood's industrial concerns. As with many of the city's older neighborhoods, this area contains many vacant and deteriorating structures. Local community groups, such as the Chapel Hill West neighborhood group, have taken positive steps to help improve aging structures, and beautify the area. The streets around Memorial Hospital are characterized by larger lots and sizeable free-standing homes. Many of the health care professionals that work at the hospital live in this area. Lastly, the blocks near the eastern edge of the neighborhood were developed in the middle of the 20th century and contain wider streets and a variety of housing styles and materials. There are still many industrial enterprises located in South End. The western part of the neighborhood specifically contains many warehouses and other small industries. The commercial mainstreet of South End is Virginia Ave. Virginia Avenue historically acted as the main shopping area for the residents of South End and contained men's and women's clothing stores, movie theaters, and specialty retail stores. Virginia Avenue's commercial importance has declined since the middle of the 20th century due to the opening of enclosed shopping centers and strip malls. The Avenue (as locals call it) still contains numerous antique shops, bars, and specialty stores. Location of Greenway Avenue Stadium, the joint home of the Fort Hill Sentinels and Allegany Campers..West Side is a neighborhood in Cumberland bounded by the Potomac River to the south, Wills Creek to the north and east, the city line on the west. The neighborhood is a mix of residential, governmental, and some commercial buildings. West Side was the first part of Cumberland to be settled by the British colonists. Fort Cumberland, a military and trade outpost was built on a hill just west of Wills Creek in the 1750s. The early growth of the city was centered around the fort. The oldest existing building in West Side, and for that matter, all of Cumberland, The George Washington Headquarters was built during this time period. The ground formerly occupied by Fort Cumberland is known home to many county government offices. The Allegany County Courthouse, County Library, and County Board of Education are among the most government buildings. The majority of the buildings surrounding these governmental offices are used for commercial purposes. Many law offices, accounting firms, real estate offices, doctor's office, and many other small businesses are located in this area. Allegany High School, which serves Cumberland's North and West sides, as well as the outlying communities of LaVale and Cresaptown, is located in this area on Rose Hill.Residential land use becomes dominant as you move west from the site of former fort. Many of Cumberland's largest and most valuable houses are located here. The housing stock ranges in age from the mid 19th century closer to the former fort, to the middle of the 20th century near the city line to the west. Some of Cumberland's newest developments are located on Haystack Mountain near the city line. The only substantial industrial land use in West Side is Riverside Industrial Park. This site was the former location of the Kelly Springfield Tire factory. Most of the factory has been torn down, including its impressive twin smoke stacks. Some of the outbuildings are still standing and used for warehousing.East Side is a neighborhood in Cumberland bounded by Williams St. to the south, Frederick St. to the west, and the city line to the north and east. The predominate land uses in East Side are residential and recreational. Two large hills, McKaig's Hill and Fort Hill dominate the landscape of East Side. There is little flat land and thus the residential development is less dense in East Side when compared to other parts of the city. The small amount of at-grade land is located at the western edge of the neighborhood. This area, now know as Decatur Heights, is a mid to late 19th century residential neighborhood contains both rowhouses and impressive free standing homes. East Side contains several new housing developments, one located on Decatur St., the other located towards the top of McKaig's Hill.Due to its steep topography, East Side is heavily forested. The largest park in the city, Constitution Park is located in this neighborhood. Constitution Park contains a public swimming pool, basketball courts, tennis courts, and playground equipment.DowntownLittle EgyptBowling GreenWills MountainHaystack MarylandShriver Ridge=== Nearby cities and towns === All cities are in Maryland, unless otherwise notedAll distances from urban core of Cumberland were calculated by http://maps.google.com, 2007 and are in order of distance.

It is built on the site of the old Fort Cumberland, the starting point for British General Edward Braddock's ill-fated attack on the French strong-hold of Fort Duquesne (located on the site of present-day Pittsburgh) during the French and Indian War. (See Braddock expedition.)Cumberland was also an outpost of Colonel George Washington during the French and Indian War and his first military headquarters was built here. Washington later returned to Cumberland as President in 1794 to review troops that had been assembled to thwart the Whiskey Rebellion.Cumberland was a key road, railroad and canal junction during the 1800s and at one time the second largest city in Maryland (second to the port city of Baltimore--hence its nickname "The Queen City"). The surrounding hillsides provided coal, iron ore, and timber that helped supply the Industrial Revolution. In addition, the city was a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics, and tinplate. However, following World War II, it began to lose much of its industrial importance and its population declined from 39,483 residents in the 1940 census to fewer than 22,000 today.
