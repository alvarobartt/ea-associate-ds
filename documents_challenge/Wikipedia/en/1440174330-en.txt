Under the leadership of Dr. Bolívar León, LDU Quito officially was founded on January 12, 1930. In those days Liga had different sports teams such as soccer, basketball, athletics, box, baseball, swimming, ping-pong, and chess. The team has a starting budget of around 500 sucres. That first team had as players (students from Universidad Central del Ecuador) had to pay for their own uniforms, medicines, and various expenses. Dr. León, had to design the first uniform, a white shirt with a red U having a background two triangles, one blue and another red, pretty similar to the University's chest. Amongst the first players were: Carlos Andrade Marín, Oswaldo Mosquera, Alfonso Cevallos, Alfonso Troya and "El mono" Icaza.First championshipIn 1932, LDU Quito won their first championship in football when a first division championship was organized in Pichincha province. This tournament was played by five teams: Liga, Gladiador, Gimnástico, Atlético, and Cleveland. Liga won all their games, and in the final game against Gladiador, played in the Municipal Stadium of "El Ejido", won be a score of 4-0. In that team, the players were: Jorge Zapater, Eduardo Flores, Alfonso Cevallos, César González, Jorge Vallarino, Jorge Naranjo, Bolívar "Ñato" León, Alejandro Dávalos, Humberto Yáñez, Humberto Freire, and Ernesto Guevara, with Bolívar León as coach.1945: The first [[Local derby|Super Classic]]A game played between Liga and Aucas will eventually become the most important game in the province, and the second most important in Ecuador. The Super Classic was born on February 11, 1945. That first game ended with a 1-1 tie. The Pichincha Football Association decided to give an opportunity to one of its teams to raise into the first category. On the 18th of the same month, the two teams met again, with another draw, 2-2. Liga was ahead in the score 2-0. Aucas scored, and when the 90 minutes were over, the time keeper ended the game, however the referee didn't notice and let the game continue for two more minutes more, and Aucas equalized. The attendance rioted and didn't let the game proceed into extra time unless the referee was changed. Finally the game restarted, but the score remained the same. That year, Liga had its first foreign player and coach, Carlos "El Chile" Díaz.The team since 1990LDU has had a lot of achievements in the last 18 years, winning six of its nine national titles in this period. The team has been important for the growth and development of the Ecuadorian football internationally as well, being an important contributor to the Ecuadorian national team that qualified and participated at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.
