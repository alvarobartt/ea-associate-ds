Their main regional rivalries are against Singapore (which are nicknamed the lions) and Indonesia.HistoryNational TeamBefore the establishment of Malaysia in September 16 1963, the Malaysia national football team was known as Malaya national football team. The team was very well known in the early 1950s to 1960s as one of the Asian footballing giants along with South Korea. Malaya's biggest achievement in football was becoming the bronze medalist in 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta after defeating South Vietnam 4-1. This team boasted luminaries such as Abdul Ghani Minhat (nicknamed "Raja Bola" or "King of the Ball"), Arthur Koh, G. Govindaraju, Robert Choe, Edwin Dutton and Stanley Gabriel.http://www.mysinchew.com/node/13264?tid=14&lt;/ref&gt;.After the establishment of the Malaysian Federation in September 16 1963, the team until today is known as the Malaysia national football team. The glory of this team continued after the establishment of Malaysia, with notable players such as Namat Abdullah and Shaharuddin Abdullah, Wong Fook Chuan, N. Thanabalan, Zulkifli Norbit and captain Abdullah Nordin.http://www.mysinchew.com/node/13264?tid=14&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia qualified for 1972 Olympics in Munich, conquering Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Philippines en route. Two years later, Malaysia won their second bronze medal in 1974 Asian Games after defeating North Korea 2-1. The team continued its glory after qualifying twice in a row for the AFC Asian Cup in 1976 and 1980.This era saw the rise of a generation of now legendary players, led from the front by the thunderous striker Mokhtar Dahari, centreback pairing of Santokh Singh and Soh Chin Aun (deemed one of the best centreback pairs in Asia in the 70s) and R. Arumugam, affectionately known as "Spiderman" for his agility, in goal.Malaysia would qualify for the Olympics for a second time, this time at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but would later boycot the tournament. Nonetheless, Malaysia would still produce quality players like "the world's first overlapping centreback" Serbegeth Singh (or Shebby Singh as he's now known), Zainal Abidin Hassan, Dollah Salleh and Lim Teong Kim, who played for Hertha Berlin in 1988.http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=/2007/7/20/sports/18359627&amp;sec=sports&lt;/ref&gt;However, the glory fell like a house of cards in 1994 as Malaysian football was embroiled in one of the biggest bribery scandals in the country. Many star players like Matlan Marjan were involved the corruption scandal that destroyed the credibility of Malaysian football. High-profile players who survived, such as Azman Adnan and Khairul Azman Mohamed continued to inspire cult followings, but the game had been badly hit.The 2000s saw the arrival of Muhamad Khalid Jamlus (a trialist with Eintracht Frankfurt), Akmal Rizal Ahmad Rakhli (once signed to RC Strasbourg) and Indra Putra Mahayuddin, among others, but for all their European connections, still failed to generate a mainstream interest in national football.The decline of the Malaysian national team comes in tandem with the decline of its domestic leagues. Many Malaysian fans point to the bribery scandal of 1994 as the catalyst, but the popularity of satellite TV has also led Malaysia's large footballing viewership away from live domestic matches to televised European games. With the dearth of mainstream interest and starvation of funds, Malaysian football today is miles away from its glorious days of the 1970s and 1980s.The Allan Harris eraIn December 2000, Allan Harris was the second big name to be brought in to coach the Malaysian national side after Frenchman Claude LeRoy. Harris came with strong credentials, having assisted Terry Venables at FC Barcelona.Midway through his tenure with the national side, he was told to take over the National Under-23 team and as a result, youth development became his responsibility.When he guided Malaysia to the bronze medal in the regional SEA Games competition, he was derided by sections of the local press for having low expectations. Despite doing a good job with the minimal resources at hand, Harris was constantly under pressure to produce results. His contract was not renewed when it ended in 2004.The Bertalan Bicskei managershipIn the second half of 2004, FAM selected Bertalan Bicskei, former Hungarian goalkeeper and national coach, to succeed Allan Harris.Coaches such as Bobby Houghton and Dragoslav Stepanovic had been serious contenders for the position of Malaysian head coach before the FAM finally settled on Bicskei.Bicskei led the national side to third place at the regional Tiger Cup competition, but was demoted to youth development duties by FAM for his actions during a friendly against Singapore in Penang on June 8 2005. Bicskei, disgusted by the standard of officiating, threw a bottle onto the pitch before confronting a Singapore player. In September, 2005 the contract was terminated after mutual agreement. The reason was that Bicskei tried to assure international friendlies for the national team, but the Football Association of Malaysian had different views.Bicskei BertalanRecent historyDespite the efforts of the FAM in organizing high profile matches for the national side such as the ones against Manchester United and Brazil, interest for the national side has generally been low.The Malaysian national side reached the semi-final stage of the 2007 ASEAN Football Championship, losing to Singapore national football team on penalties after playing out a 2-2 draw over two legs.Asian Cup 2007Malaysia participated in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup as co-hosts along with Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. They were placed together in Group C with China, Uzbekistan and Iran. They lost all three matches, including losing 1-5 to China and 0-5 to Uzbekistan. With an aggregate score of 12-1, Malaysia became the only team that finished the tournament without any points.This resulted in a nationwide furore, which led to the resignations of head coach Norizan Bakar and FAM officials Tengku Abdullah and Khairy Jamaluddin. B. Sathianathan was selected to replace Bakar after winning the Merdeka Cup tournament with the Malaysian Under-23 side.KitThe Official Malaysia National team Kit is manufactured by Nike. It was officially launched in January 2007 and made its debut in the Asean Football Championship 2007 in Bangkok. The association with Nike will last till 2011.The home kit's design of black and yellow stripes is a throwback to the kit used by Malaysian national team of the 1920s. The great national team of 1970s also sported similar stripes, which are supposed to be reminiscent of the stripes of a tiger, the symbol of Malaysia's national football team. This new home kit also sports black shorts and yellow socks. The new away kit features a blue jersey, white shorts, and blue socks.What will give further distinction to the new Malaysian kit is also the representation of the Malay ‘keris’ at the bottom left corner of each shirt.Competition RecordsWorld Cup record[[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2010 FIFA World Cup]]-Malaysia were assigned to Pot B of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) and were drawn against Bahrain. |score = 4 &ndash; 1 |report = Report |team2 =  |goals1 = Fatadi John Abdulrahman Hubail  |goals2 = Bunyamin Omar  |stadium = Manama National Stadium, Manama |attendance = 4,000 |referee = Yang (China PR)  |score = 0 &ndash; 0 |report = Report |team2 =  |goals1 = |goals2 = |stadium = Shah Alam Stadium, Petaling Jaya |attendance = 2,000 |referee = Lee Gi-Young (South Korea)  Bahrain won 4 &ndash; 1 on aggregate and advanced to the Third Round.- FIFA World Cup RecordYearRoundPositionGPWDLGSGAURU 1930 to  1970Did Not Enter-------FRG 1974 to  2010Did Not Qualify-------Total--------Olympic Games Record Olympic Games RecordYearRoundPositionGPWDLGSGAFRA 1900Did Not Enter-------USA 1904Did Not Enter-------GBR 1908Did Not Enter-------SWE 1912Did Not Enter-------BEL 1920Did Not Enter-------FRA 1924Did Not Enter-------NED 1928Did Not Enter-------GER|Nazi 1936Did Not Enter-------GBR 1948Did Not Enter-------FIN 1952Did Not Enter-------AUS 1956Did Not Enter-------ITA 1960Did Not Enter-------JPN 1964Did Not Qualify-------MEX 1968Did Not Qualify-------GER 1972Round 110/16310239CAN 1976Did Not Qualify-------USSR 1980Qualify but boycott-------USA 1984Did Not Qualify-------KOR 1988Did Not Qualify-------ESP 1992Did Not Qualify-------USA 1996Did Not Qualify-------AUS 2000Did Not Qualify-------GRE 2004Did Not Qualify-------CHN 2008Did Not Qualify-------Total2/24-310239Since 1992, football at the Summer Olympics changes into Under-23 tournament.Olympic Games HistoryYearRoundScoreResult1972Round 1 0 &ndash; 3 LossRound 1 3 &ndash; 0 WinRound 1 0 &ndash; 6 LossAFC Asian Cup RecordAFC Asian Cup RecordYearRoundPositionGPWDLGSGAHKG|1910 1956Did Not Qualify-------KOR 1960Did Not Qualify-------ISR 1964Did Not Qualify-------IRN|1964 1968Did Not Qualify-------THA 1972Did Not Qualify-------IRN|1964 1976Round 15/6201113KUW 1980Round 16/10412155SIN 1984Did Not Qualify-------QAT 1988Did Not Qualify-------JPN 1992Did Not Qualify-------UAE 1996Did Not Qualify-------LBN 2000Did Not Qualify-------CHN 2004Did Not Qualify-------MAS 2007Round 116/163003112Total3/14-9135720**Red border color indicates tournament was held on home soil.Asian Games RecordAsian Games RecordYearRoundPositionGPWDLGSGAIND 1951Did Not Enter-------PHI 1954Did Not Enter-------JPN 1958Round 112/14300328IDN 1962Third Place3/85302239THA 1966Round 115/17300315THA 1970Round 116/16300304IRN 1974Third Place3/1573222013THA 1978Round 27/145203410IND 1982Round 114/16300314KOR 1986Round 115/18301225CHN 1990Did Not Enter-------JPN 1994Round 111/184112611THA 1998Did Not Enter-------KOR 2002Round 111/16310236QAT 2006Round 123/243003210Total11/152 Third Place42104286485Since 2002, football at the Asian Games changes into Under-23 tournament.Tiger Cup/AFF Football Championship record Tiger Cup/AFF Football Championship recordYearRoundPositionGPWD*LGSGASIN 1996Runners-up2/106321184VIE 1998Round 16/8301203THA 2000Third Place3/96411124IDN 2002Fourth Place4/9521295VIE 2004Third Place3/107502149SIN 2007Semi-finalist3/8513163IDN 2008Qualified-------Total7/71 Runners-up3215895928*Denotes draws include knockout matches decided on penalty kicks.**Red border color indicates tournament was held on home soil.Schedule and recent resultsMatches under B.
