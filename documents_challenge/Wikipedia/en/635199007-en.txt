  at Helsinki (2007)]]  at Belgrade (2008)]] Finland first entered the Eurovision Song Contest in 1961, and has participated a total of 42 times. Finland won the contest for the first time in 2006 with Lordi's "Hard Rock Hallelujah". Previously, its best showing was Marion Rung’s song "Tom tom tom" in 1973, which was placed 6th.Before the 2006 victory, Finland was considered by many as the ultimate under-achiever of Eurovision. It has placed last total eight times and scored "nul points" (zero points) three times. Finland's entry in 1982, Nuku pommiin by Kojo, was one of only fifteen songs since the modern scoring system was instituted in 1975 to earn no points. (Norway has placed last ten times and scored zero points four times, but it has also won twice.) In 2006, Finland finally gained victory, with an entry radically different from the mainstream europop that dominates the competition: a hard rock song, played by a monster band in an over-the-top fashion. The band Lordi and its song Hard Rock Hallelujah broke records scoring the highest number of points in Eurovision Song Contest history (292).All Finland's entries were in English between 2000 and 2007, and between 1973 and 1976; both of these periods allowed submissions in any language. All of Finland’s other songs have been in Finnish, except in 1990, when Fri? by Beat was in Swedish.In voting patterns, Finland has traditionally supported and been supported by the Baltic nations, such as Estonia and Latvia. However, it also has close ties to other Nordic countries. In 2004, Finland's first-place vote went to Sweden; in 2005, it contributed 12 points to Norway; in 2006, it was Russia's turn to get the 12 points, but it was Serbia who got their top score in 2007. The first time in Eurovision history that Sweden gave Finland 12 points was in 2006 for Lordi's song "Hard Rock Hallelujah". In 2007, they repeated this, giving 12 points to Hanna Pakarinen with "Leave Me Alone". Finland has also given notably high points to Italy, but that country has not competed since 1997.ContestantsYearArtistTitleFinalPointsSemiPoints1961]]Laila KinnunenValoa ikkunassa1061962]]Marion RungTipi-Tii741963]]Laila HalmeMuistojeni laulu1301964]]Lasse MårtensonLaiskotellen791965]]Viktor Klimenko]]Aurinko laskee länteen1501966]]Ann Christine]]Playboy]]1071967]]Fredi]]Varjoon - suojaan1231968]]Kristina HautalaKun kello käy1611969]]Jarkko &amp; LauraKuin silloin ennen1261971]]Markku Aro & KoivistolaisetTie uuteen päivään8841972]]Päivi Paunu & Kim FloorMuistathan12781973]]Marion RungTom Tom Tom6931974]]CaritaKeep Me Warm1341975]]PihasoittajatOld Man Fiddle7741976]]Fredi &amp; ystävätPump-Pump11441977]]Monica AspelundLapponia]]10501978]]Seija SimolaAnna rakkaudelle tilaisuus1821979]]Katri HelenaKatson sineen taivaan14381980]]Vesa-Matti LoiriHuilumies1961981]]Riki SorsaReggae OK16271982]]Kojo]]Nuku pommiin1801983]]Ami AspelundFantasiaa11411984]]KirkaHengaillaan9461985]]Sonja LummeEläköön elämä9581986]]Kari KuivalainenNever The End15221987]]Boulevard]]Sata salamaa15321988]]Boulevard]]Nauravat silmät muistetaan2031989]]Anneli SaaristoLa Dolce Vita]]7761990]]Beat]]Fri?2181991]]Kaija KärkinenHullu yö2061992]]Pave MaijanenYamma, Yamma2341993]]Katri HelenaTule luo17201994]]CatCatBye Bye Baby]]22111996]]Jasmine]]Niin kaunis on taivas2391998]]Edea]]Aava15222000]]Nina ÅströmA Little Bit]]18182002]]Laura]]Addicted To You]]20242004]]Jari SillanpääTakes 2 To TangoXX14512005]]Geir RönningWhy?]]XX18502006]]'''LordiHard Rock Hallelujah129212922007]]Hanna PakarinenLeave Me Alone]]1753XX2008]]TeräsbetoniMissä miehet ratsastaa22358792009]]Voting historyFinland has given the most points to...RankCountryPoints1Sweden1292Italy1153Israel1074United Kingdom1045Switzerland98Finland has received the most points from...RankCountryPoints1Sweden812Norway653Greece594=Ireland554=Israel555Spain52HostingsYearLocationVenuePresenter2007]]Finland HelsinkiHartwall AreenaJaana Pelkonen and Mikko LeppilampiExternal linksEurovision official websiteFinnish voting historyNational Final 2009 Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:Finland in the Eurovision Song Contestda:Finland i Eurovision Song Contest de:Finnland beim Eurovision Song Contest el:Συμμετοχή της Φινλανδίας στη Eurovision es:Finlandia en el Festival de la Canción de Eurovisión fr:Finlande au Concours Eurovision de la chanson it:Finlandia e l'Eurofestival he:פינלנד באירוויזיון nl:Finland en het Eurovisie Songfestival pl:Finlandia w Konkursie Piosenki Eurowizji fi:Suomi Eurovision laulukilpailussa sv:Finlands bidrag i Eurovision Song Contest tr:Eurovision'da Finlandiya
