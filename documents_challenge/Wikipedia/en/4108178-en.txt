He used to play as a defensive midfielder for former club Etoile Carouge, but on his arrival at Arsenal was converted to a central defender. He occasionally fills in at full back for Arsenal and played several games in central midfield while on loan to Birmingham City.Playing careerYouth developmentDjourou was born in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, to Ivorian parents Joachim and Angeline, and was later adopted by his father's first wife Daniele, a Swiss woman. They moved to Geneva when he was 17 months old. He enrolled at the Payerne Training Center when he was 13 and then in 2002 joined local second division side Etoile-Carouge FC as a midfielder at 15. A few months later he signed scholarship forms for the Arsenal Academy. He officially joined Arsenal as a professional on August 1 2003. He was a member of the Swiss European Under-19 Football Championship squad in 2004.Arsenal careerHe made his first senior start for Arsenal in a 3&ndash;1 victory against Everton in the Carling Cup, having made his first appearance after 89 minutes of the corresponding match in the previous round against Manchester City on October 27, 2004.Djourou made his full Premiership debut for Arsenal in the 7&ndash;0 victory over Middlesbrough on January 14, 2006, playing at centre-back with Philippe Senderos.Djourou started Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round clash with Bolton Wanderers as part of a makeshift defence, a game in which Arsenal lost 1&ndash;0. He had also played in the third round clash with Cardiff City.In February 2006, Djourou played in the league games against West Ham United, Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers. In April 2006 he came on as a substitute against Aston Villa in Arsenal's 5&ndash;0 victory, replacing the injured Emmanuel Eboué. He started April's premiership game against Portsmouth, a game which also saw the comeback of Sol Campbell.During this season, several Italian clubs (including Juventus) scouted Djourou in Arsenal's reserve matches (his contract was to expire at the end of the 2006&ndash;07 season), but after the end of the World Cup, he signed a six-year contract extension with Arsenal.He played in Arsenal's 2007 pre-season Emirates Cup win, against both Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. On August 10, 2007 he signed for Birmingham City on loan for a five-month period. He made his debut two days later against the previous season's FA Cup and League Cup winners Chelsea. This was a closely fought contest in which Chelsea ran out eventual 3&ndash;2 winners, in which Djourou cleared off the line from Frank Lampard to keep Birmingham City in the game.Djourou continued to play for Birmingham consistently through his loan period until December 22 2007, when he gifted Bolton Wanderers' Nicolas Anelka a goal via an errant throw-in. This marked his last appearance for the club. Although Birmingham boss Alex McLeish was keen to retain him, Djourou returned to Arsenal at the end of his loan spell, as cover for Kolo Toure and Alex Song while they play in the 2008 African Cup of Nations. In May 2008, Djourou stated that he would be willing to partner Cesc Fabregas in midfield after the departure of Mathieu Flamini to A.C. Milan. At 1.92&nbsp;m, Djorou could provide the physical presence that Arsenal have been lacking since the departure of Patrick Vieira in 2005. However, he did not. Instead the young Swiss played in the center of defense as first choice backup following the departure of fellow Swiss defender Philippe Senderos to AC Milan on a season long loan. It was confirmed on the 22nd of September that he had signed a new long-term contract.International career He made his senior Switzerland international debut against Scotland on 1 March2006, coming on as a substitute and again playing alongside Philippe Senderos. Djourou was called up to the Switzerland 2006 FIFA World Cup squad, despite not playing in the qualifiers. Although third choice central defender behind Philippe Senderos of Arsenal and Patrick Müller of Lyon, he started Switzerland's round 16 game against Ukraine. Injury, however, led him to be substituted in the first half. Later that year, he made two appearances during Switzerland's qualification campaign for the UEFA U-21 Championship, but has not appeared for the Swiss U-21 squad since.AwardsOn December 162006, Djourou was elected Newcomer of the Year 2006 during the TV Show Swiss Sports Awards.Club career statistics(correct as of 19 May, 2008)ClubSeasonLeagueCup*EuropeTotalAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsArsenal2004&ndash;05]]0003000302005&ndash;06]]70050001202006&ndash;07]]21004050300Birmingham City]] (loan)2007&ndash;08]]13000000130Arsenal2007&ndash;08]]200100030Total430013050610(* FA Cup, League Cup and FA Community Shield)ReferencesExternal linksThe Premiership Interview: Teenager going places fast at sport.independent.co.ukProfile at arsenal.comProfile at bcfc.comProfile at 4thegame.comProfile at premierleague.com    Category:Swiss expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Swiss footballers Category:Switzerland international footballers Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:Football (soccer) defenders Category:Swiss of Côte d'Ivoire descent Category:Swiss adoptees Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Abidjan Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Football (soccer) utility playersar:يوهان دجورو bn:জোহান ডিযোরু bg:Йохан Джуру de:Johan Djourou es:Johan Djourou fr:Johan Djourou it:Johan Djourou hu:Johan Djourou nl:Johan Djourou ja:ジョアン・ジュルー no:Johan Djourou pl:Johan Djourou ru:Джуру, Йоан fi:Johan Djourou sv:Johan Djourou th:โยฮัน ชูรู tr:Johan Djourou zh:祖漢·佐羅
