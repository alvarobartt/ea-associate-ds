One story says the first stroopwafel was made by an anonymous baker in 1784. Another story ascribes the invention of the stroopwafel to the baker Gerard Kamphuisen, which would date the first stroopwafels somewhere between 1810, the year when he opened his bakery, and 1840, the year of the oldest known recipe for syrup waffles. In the 19th century, there were around 100 syrup waffle bakers in Gouda, which was the only city in which they were made until 1870. After 1870 they were also made at parties and in markets outside the city of Gouda. In the 20th century factories started to make stroopwafels. In 1960 there were seventeen factories in Gouda alone, of which four are currently still open.ReferencesExternal linksHow stroopwafels are made.
