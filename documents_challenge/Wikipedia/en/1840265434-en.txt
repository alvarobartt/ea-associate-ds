The club plays its home games at Komplett.no Arena, located in Sandefjord, Vestfold.Reaching the Adeccoligaen (the 1st division) in 1999, the club made quick progress and soon settled as a strong competitor for promotion to the Tippeligaen (the premier league). Finishing third in the 1st division both in 2002 and 2003 they qualified for play-off matches, but lost both times. In 2004 they finished fourth, but the 2005 season finally proved a success. Placing second, Sandefjord earned automatic promotion to the highest division.The club performed surprisingly well in their first Tippeligaen season, finishing 9th in the table and reaching the cup final. However, the 2007 season was a disaster and they finished last and were relegated to the Adeccoligaen.Two-thirds of the way through the 2008 season in the Adeccoligaen, Sandefjord Fotball occupy 3rd spot in the table with 43 points. New to this season in the Adeccoligaen is that the top three teams in the division earn promotion to the Tippeligaen and Sandefjord Fotball are currently on course to secure one of the promotion spots.HistorySandefjord Fotball were formed by parent clubs IL Runar and Sandefjord Ballklubb in 1998. They replaced Sandefjord Ballklubb in the 2nd division in 1999, and secured immediate promotion to the 1st division. There the club made quick progress and soon settled as a strong competitor for promotion to the Tippeligaen. Finishing third in the 1st division both in 2002 and 2003 they qualified for play-off matches, but lost both times, against SK Brann and Vålerenga IF. The 2003 play-off was lost after some controversial decisions by referee Jonny Ditlefsen that were all in Sandefjords disfavor. When manager Tom Nordlie left after the play-off games, Sandefjord Fotball hired Arne Dokken as their new coach. He was fired after just one season, 2004, when they finished fourth. But the 2005 season finally proved a success, with Tor Thodesen as their new coach. Placing second, Sandefjord earned automatic promotion to the highest division, where they finished 9th in their first season.The 2007 season ended badly and they finished last and were relegated to the Adeccoligaen. The players went to the board of directors together and requested the hiring of a new coach. Instead of firing Thodesen, the board kept him. After a bad start to the 2008 season, they finally fired Thodesen and hired Patrick Walker. The team played better after this, and he moved the team from a relegation place to a promotion place in the table in eight games.Colours and BadgeSandefjord Fotball's colours are blue. They play in blue shirts, blue shorts and white socks. The club changed their badge before the start of season 2006. This was mainly for press purposes. The old badge had a yellow field as well as the blue and red. The new badge only has the colours red and blue.StadiumSandefjord Fotball play their home games at Komplett.no Arena. Komplett.no Arena was opened July 21st 2007, and cost about 100 million NOK. This is an all modern stadium, with a capacity of about 9 000. Record attendance was set during the opening game versus FC Lyn Oslo July 21st 2007. 8 103 people attended this game. In the future it is planned to expand the stadium to a capacity of 12 500. Field measurements are 105 x 68 meters.Before Sandefjord Fotball started to use their new home arena, Komplett.no Arena, they used to play their home encounters at Storstadion. Sandefjord Fotball played their home games at Storstadion from 1999 to 2007. As the stadium itself did not live up to the standards one could expect from a modern football stadium, it was finally decided to build the new and modern Komplett.no Arena and start a new and exciting chapter in the young clubs history.PlayersCurrent squadAs of August 25, 2008.
