Brighton experienced rapid population growth reaching a peak of over 160,000 by 1961.Carder, Timothy (1990). The Encyclopaedia of Brighton. S.127 East Sussex County Libraries. ISBN 0-86147-315-9 Modern Brighton forms part of a conurbation stretching along the coast, with a population of around 480,000.Eight million tourists a year visit Brighton. The town also has a substantial business conference industry. Brighton has two universities and a medical school.HistoryIn the Domesday Book, Brighton was called Bristelmestune and a rent of 4,000 herring was established. In June 1514 Brighthelmstone was burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war between England and France. Only part of the St Nicholas Church and the street pattern of the area now known as "The Lanes" survived. The first drawing of Brighthelmstone was made in 1545 and depicts what is believed to be the raid of 1514.Carder (1990), s.17 During the 1740s and 1750s, Dr Richard Russell of Lewes began prescribing seawater at Brighton. By 1780, development of the Georgian terraces had started and the fishing village became the fashionable resort of Brighton. Growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783.Carder (1990), s.71 He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion during the early part of his Regency.The arrival of the railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London and population growth from around 7,000 in 1801 to over 120,000 by 1901.Carder (1990), s.127 The Victorian era saw the building of many landmarks including the Grand Hotel (1864), the West Pier (1866) and the Palace Pier (1899).After boundary changes between 1873 and 1952, the land area of Brighton increased from 1,640&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(7&nbsp;km²) in 1854 to 14,347&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(58&nbsp;km²) in 1952.Carder (1990), s.13 New housing estates were established in the acquired areas including Moulsecoomb, Bevendean, Coldean and Whitehawk. The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of Patcham, Ovingdean and Rottingdean, and much council housing was built in parts of Woodingdean after the Second World War.More recently, gentrification of much of Brighton has seen a return of the fashionable image which characterised the growth of the Regency period.

It features a funfair, restaurants and arcade halls. The funfair has been criticised for its prices, with rides costing up to £8. Brightonians refer to it as Palace Pier in protest at the commercialisation.The Argus newspaperThe Argus newspaperThe Argus newspaperWest Pier was built in 1866 and has been closed since 1975 awaiting renovation, which faces continual setbacks, in part because the owners of the Palace Pier, the Noble Organisation, have opposed plans.Pier Threatens To Unplug Rival (from The Argus)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The West Pier is one of only two Grade I listed piers in the United Kingdom, but suffered two fires in 2003.

The Monarch's Way long-distance footpath heads west along the seafront above the beach.Since the 1978 demolition of the open-air lido at Black Rock, the most easterly part of Brighton's seafront, the area has been developed and now features one of Europe's largest marinas. However, the site of the pool itself remains empty except for a skate park and graffiti wall, and further development is planned including a high-rise hotel which has aroused debate, mirroring proposals for the King Alfred leisure centre in Hove.
