Nicknamed El Chino ("The Chinese") and El zurdo de Vitacura ("The lefty from Vitacura"), he became the first Latin American player to reach the top position on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) singles rankings in 1998. He held the world number one ranking for six weeks. He also has held the top ranking in juniors and seniors. He was the first player in tennis history to win the three clay-court Masters Series tournaments (Monte Carlo, Rome, and Hamburg). He is the only male player in the open era to have held the world number one ranking despite never winning a Grand Slam singles tournament.Tennis careerEarly yearsRíos began playing tennis at the age of 11 at the Sport Française country club in Vitacura (Greater Santiago), adjacent to his house. He was soon recognized for his talented left-hand and reserved personality.JuniorsIn 1993, Ríos became the first male player from Latin America to be ranked world number one in juniors. That year, he won the boys' singles title at the US Open and his first satellite tournament in Chile.ATP Tour Ríos turned professional in 1994. He won his first Challenger Series tournament at Dresden later that year. In 1995, he won his first top-level tour title at Bologna. He became the first Chilean to be ranked in the world's top 10 in 1996.In January 1998, Ríos reached his first (and only) Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, where Petr Korda of the Czech Republic defeated Ríos in straight sets. Korda, however, tested positive for nandrolone at that year's Wimbledon event, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of his victory against Ríos.In March 1998, Ríos became the first Latin American male to reach the world number one singles ranking after defeating Andre Agassi in the final of the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida. Ríos held that ranking for six weeks but ended the year at world number two behind Pete Sampras.A number of injuries and operations sidelined Ríos from competition during much of 2000 and 2001, with his ranking dropping below the 300s.In 2004, six years after claiming the world number one ranking, and after a long absence from the tour, Ríos returned to competition with a 6–0, 6–0 victory at a Challenger Series tournament in Ecuador. He played his last competitive match in early April 2004 at a challenger in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, where he retired in the round of 16.Ríos was to return to ATP competition in February 2007 at the Viña del Mar tournament (Movistar Open); however, he retired with a back injury.Tour retirementOn July 16, 2004, Ríos announced his retirement from the sport. He organized a farewell tour across his home country, travelling through several cities, meeting with fans, offering tennis clinics, and playing friendly matches with international and local tennis players. The tour ended on December 22 2004, at a soccer stadium in Santiago, where he played his final tennis match against Guillermo Coria of Argentina.On March 30, 2007, Ríos played an exhibition match against Andre Agassi, both as a way to commemorate the match where Ríos rose to world number one and as way of having the American play in Chile. On June 24, 2008, Ríos defeated Pete Sampras in an exhibition match.Seniors On March 29, 2006, Ríos —aged 30— debuted on the Merryl Lynch's Tour of Champions, a tour for senior's players. At his first tournament on the tour in Doha, Qatar, he defeated Thomas Muster, Henri Leconte, Pat Cash, and Cédric Pioline to claim the title.

Their only child, Constanza, was born in June 2001. Soon after returning to competition in 2004, Ríos and his wife separated, and their marriage was annulled. During this period, Ríos worked as a sports commentator for a radio station in Chile.Ríos was remarried in April 2005 to model María Eugenia "Kenita" Larraín, a former fiancée of soccer star Iván Zamorano. The couple subsequently experienced a very public break-up in September of the same year after an incident in Costa Rica in which Larraín was allegedly injured in an accident.

Astorga was later fired as trainer.After a magazine published some photos of him dancing seductively with a woman at a Paris disco, his girlfriend Giuliana Sotela broke up with him. Later, during a Davis Cup press conference, he read a letter, asking Sotela for forgiveness. He ended the press conference in tears.He was accused by his second wife, María Eugenia Larraín, of throwing her off of his car while visiting his daughter in Costa Rica. Larraín arrived to Santiago's airport in dramatic fashion, on a wheelchair and showing multiple bruises on her legs. He claimed those bruises were caused by falling while skiing.He was arrested in Rome in 2001 after he punched a taxi driver in the nose and then had a fight with the policemen arresting him.In 2003, while training for a Davis Cup tie with Ecuador, he allegedly urinated on some men in a La Serena bar's bathroom and was later expelled from his hotel after being accused of swimming in the nude.
