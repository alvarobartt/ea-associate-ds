  Mimosa or Becrux (β Cru / β Crucis / Beta Crucis) is the second brightest star in the constellation Crux (after Alpha Crucis or Acrux) and is one of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky.Beta Crucis is located approximately 353 light years distant. It is a spectroscopic binary with components that are too close together to resolve with a telescope. The pair orbit each other every 5 years and are separated by about 8 AU. Beta Crucis, being of spectral type B0.5IV, is believed to be the hottest first-magnitude star.Since Beta Crucis is at roughly &minus;60° declination, it is only visible south of the Tropic of Cancer and therefore didn't receive a known ancient traditional name. "Mimosa" is a recent name based on its color, while "Becrux" is simply a combination of the "Be" in Beta plus Crux. It is known as 十字架三 (the Third Star of the Cross) in Chinese.External linkshttp://jumk.de/astronomie/big-stars/becrux.shtml  Category:Variable_star_stubs Crucis, Beta Category:B-type giants Category:Crux constellation Category:Stars with proper namesbr:Beta Crucis de:Becrux es:Becrux fr:Beta Crucis ko:남십자자리 베타 it:Mimosa (astronomia) nl:Becrux ja:ベクルックス pl:Mimosa pt:Becrux ru:Бекрукс sk:Becrux fi:Beta Crucis zh:十字架三
