in the Bayerischer Wald]]The Bavarian Forest (German: ) is a wooded low-mountain region in Bavaria, Germany. It extends along the Czech border and is continued on the Czech side by the Šumava (Bohemian Forest). Geographically the Bavarian Forest and Bohemian Forest are sections of the same mountain range. A part of the Bavarian Forest belongs to the Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald (240&nbsp;km²), established in 1970 as the first national park in Germany. The Bayerischer Wald is a remnant of the Hercynian Forest that stretched across southern Germania in Roman times.The highest mountain in the region is the Großer Arber ("Great Arber", 1456&nbsp;m). The main river is the Regen, which is formed by the conjunction of White Regen and Black Regen and leaves the mountains towards the city of Regensburg.External linksNationalpark Bayerischer WaldBavarian Forest - Official Website of the Region Category:Geography of Bavaria Category:National parks of Germany Category:Mountain ranges of Germanybar:Boarischa Woid da:Bayerischer Wald de:Bayerischer Wald et:Baieri mets es:Bosque bávaro fr:Forêt de Bavière lt:Bavarijos Miškas nl:Beierse Woud nn:Bayerischer Wald pl:Las Bawarski ru:Баварский лес sk:Bavorský les sv:Bayerischer Wald
