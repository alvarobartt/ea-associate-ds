 ]] Jan Garbarek (born 4 March 1947 in Mysen, Norway) a Norwegian tenor and soprano saxophonist, active in the jazz, classical, and world music genres. Garbarek was the only child of a former Polish prisoner of war Czeslaw Garbarek and a Norwegian farmer's daughter. Effectively stateless till the age of seven (there is no automatic grant of citizenship in Norway) Garbarek grew up in Oslo. At 21, he married Vigdis. His daughter Anja Garbarek is also a musician. He has also played the bass saxophone.Garbarek's sound is one of the hallmarks of the ECM record label, which has released virtually all of his recordings. His style incorporates a sharp-edged tone, long, keening, sustained notes strongly reminiscent of Islamic prayer calls, and generous use of silence. He began his recording career in the late 1960s, notably featuring on recordings by the American jazz composer George Russell (such as Othello Ballet Suite and Electronic Sonata for Souls Loved by Nature). If he had initially appeared as a devotee of Albert Ayler and Peter Brötzmann, by 1973 he had turned his back on the harsh dissonances of avant-garde jazz, retaining only his tone from his previous approach.As a composer, Garbarek tends to draw heavily from Scandinavian folk melodies, a legacy of his Ayler influence. He is also a pioneer of ambient jazz composition, most notably on his 1976 album Dis. This textural approach, which rejects traditional notions of thematic improvisation (best exemplified by Sonny Rollins) in favour of a style described by critics Richard Cook and Brian Morton as "sculptural in its impact", has been critically divisive. Garbarek's more meandering recordings are often labeled as New Age music, a style generally scorned by more orthodox jazz musicians and listeners, or spiritual ancestors thereof. Other experiments have included setting a collection of poems of Olav H. Hauge to music, with a single saxophone complementing a full mixed choir; this has led to notable performances with Grex Vocalis, but not yet to recordings.After recording a string of unheralded avant-garde albums, Garbarek rose to international prominence in the mid-1970s playing post-bop jazz, both as a member of and a leader of Keith Jarrett's successful "European Quartet". He achieved considerable commercial success in Europe with Dis, a meditative collaboration with guitarist Ralph Towner that featured the distinctive sound of a wind harp on several tracks. (Selections from Dis have been used as incidental music in several feature films and documentaries.) In the 1980s, Garbarek's music began to incorporate synthesizers and elements of world music. In 1993, during the Gregorian chant craze, his album Officium, a collaboration with early music vocal performers the Hilliard Ensemble, became one of ECM's biggest-selling albums of all time, reaching the pop charts in several European countries. (Its sequel, Mnemosyne, followed in 1999.) In 2005, his album In Praise of Dreams was nominated for a Grammy. He has composed music for the film Kippur.In addition to the selections from Dis, Garbarek has also composed music for several other European films, including French and Norwegian films. Also his song "Rites" was used in the American film The Insider.Major collaboratorsKeith JarrettGary PeacockMiroslav VitoušAnouar BrahemZakir HussainCharlie HadenRalph TownerDavid TornTrilok GurtuEgberto GismontiManu KatchéMarilyn MazurNana VasconcelosEberhard WeberRainer BrüninghausTerje RypdalPalle DanielssonJon ChristensenGeorge RussellBill ConnorsUstad Bade Fateh Ali KhanDeeyah (Deepika Thathaal)Ustad Shaukat Hussain KhanUstad Nazim Ali KhanOystein SevagPalle MikkelborgNotable recordingsJazz Moments (1966) with Karin KrogTil Vigdis (1967)Joy (1968) with Karin KrogEsoteric Circle (1969)Afric Pepperbird (1970)Trip to Pillargui (1970) with George Russell SextetListen to the Silence (1971) with George RussellTerje Rypdal (1971) with Terje RypdalSart (1971) with Terje RypdalHav (1971) with Jan Erik Vold and Terje RypdalTriptykon (1972)Witchi-Tai-To (1973)Red Lanta (1973) with Art LandeBelonging (1974) with Keith JarrettLuminessence (1974) with Keith JarrettSolstice (1974) with Ralph TownerDansere (1975) with Bobo Stenson QuartetArbour Zena (1975) with Keith JarrettDis (1976) with Ralph TownerPlaces (1977)Of Mist And Melting (1977) with Bill ConnorsDecember Poems (1977) med Gary PeacockDeer Wan (1977) with Kenny WheelerSol Do Meio Dia (1977) with Egberto GismontiSound And Shadows (1977) with Ralph TownerMy Song (1977) with Keith JarrettPhoto With Blue Sky, White Cloud, Wires, Windows and a Red Roof (1978)with Bill ConnorsPersonal Mountains (1979) with Keith JarrettFolk Songs (1979) with Egberto Gismonti and Charlie HadenMagico (1979) with Egberto Gismonti and Charlie HadenAftenland (1979) with Kjell JohnsenNude Ants (1979) with Keith JarrettEventyr (1980)Paths, Prints (1981) with Bill FrisellVoice from the Past Paradigm (1981) with Gary PeacockCycles (1981) with David DarlingWayfarer (1983) with Bill Frisell and Eberhard WeberVision (1983) with L.
