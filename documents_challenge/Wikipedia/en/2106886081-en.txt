Given that Constitutional reforms in 2005 abolished life senators starting in 2006, Frei ran for an elected Senate seat in the December 2005 parliamentary elections and was victorious. He was elected in the electoral district of Valdivia Province and Osorno Province together with Andrés Allamand. On March 11 2006 Frei became President of the Senate, like his father, who was also President of the Senate after being President of the Republic.External linksOfficial Biography (in Spanish)Genealogical chart of Frei-Montalva Family        Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:People from Santiago Category:Presidents of Chile Category:Chilean politicians Category:Chilean senators Category:Chilean presidential candidates Category:Chilean Christian Democrats Category:Chilean Roman Catholics Category:Civil engineers Category:Chileans of Swiss descentbn:এদুয়ার্দো ফ্রেই রুইস-তাগ্‌লে ca:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle de:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle es:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle fr:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle gl:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle io:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle it:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle nl:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle no:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle oc:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle pl:Eduardo Frei (młodszy) pt:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle rm:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle fi:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle sv:Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle zh:爱德华多·弗雷·鲁伊斯-塔格莱
