This article deals with mass killings that are not considered genocide.Mass murder (massacre) is the act of murdering a large number of people, typically at the same time or over a relatively short period of time.Aggrawal A. (2005) Mass Murder. In: Payne-James JJ, Byard RW, Corey TS, Henderson C (Eds.) Encyclopedia of Forensic and Legal Medicine, Vol. 3, Pp. 216-223. Elsevier Academic Press, London Mass murder may be committed by individuals or organizations.The term may refer to spree killers, who stage a single assault on their victims.The largest mass killings in history have been attempts to exterminate entire groups or communities of people, often on the basis of ethnicity or religion. Some of these mass murders have been found to be genocides and others to be crimes against humanity, but often such crimes have led to few or no convictions of any type.Mass murder by individualsThe term "mass murder" refers to the killing of four or more people during a particular event. Examples would include killing several people in the course of a robbery, or setting a crowded nightclub on fire where four or more deaths occur.The USA Bureau of Justice Statistics defines a mass murder as "involving the murder of four or more victims at one location, within one event." Mass murderers may fall into any of a number of categories, including killers of family, of coworkers, of students, and of random strangers. Their motives for murder vary.Inside a Mass Murderer's Mind - TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Many other motivations are possible, including the need for attention or fame ABC News: What Pushes Shooters to Mass Murder?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Notoriety Drives Mass Shooters - Newser&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;ABC News: Psychiatrist: Showing Video Is 'Social Catastrophe'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.Workers who assault fellow employees are sometimes called "disgruntled workers," but this is often a misnomer, as many perpetrators are ex-workers. They are dismissed from their jobs and subsequently turn up heavily armed and kill their former colleagues. In the 1980s, when two fired postal workers carried out such massacres in separate incidents in the US, the term "going postal" became synonymous with employees snapping and setting out on murderous rampages. One of the 1980s most famous "disgruntled worker" cases involved computer programmer Richard Farley who, after being fired for stalking one of his co-workers, a woman by the name of Laura Black, returned to his former workplace and shot to death seven of his colleagues, although he failed in his attempt to kill Black herself.In some rare cases mass murders have been committed during prison riots and uprisings. During the February, 1980 New Mexico State Penitentiary riot, 33 inmates were killed. Most of the dead, 23, lived in the Protective Custody Unit, and were killed by other inmates using knives, axes and being burnt alive over a 48-hour period.Unlike serial killers, there is rarely a sexual motive to individual mass-murderers, with the possible exception of Sylvestre Matuschka, an Austrian man who apparently derived sexual pleasure from blowing up trains with dynamite, ideally with people in them. His lethal sexual fetish claimed 22 lives before he was caught in 1932.According to Loren Coleman's book Copycat Effect, publicity about multiple deaths tends to provoke more, whether workplace or school shootings or mass suicides.Mass murder by terrorists.In recent years, terrorists have performed acts of mass murder to intimidate a society and draw attention to their causes. Examples of major terrorist incidents involving mass murder of more than 100 individual include:June 23, 1985 Air India Flight 182 bombing over the Atlantic Ocean - 329 killedDecember 21, 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Scotland - 270 killedMarch 12,1993 Bombay bombings - 257 killedApril 19, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in the United States - 168 killedAugust 7, 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania - 224 killedSeptember 11, 2001 September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States - 2,997 killedOctober 12, 2002 Bali bombing in Indonesia - 202 killedMarch 2, 2004 Ashura massacre in Iraq - 170 killed11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings in Spain - 191 killedSeptember 4, 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis in Russia - 344 killedFebruary 28, 2005 Al Hillah bombing in Iraq - 127 killed11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings in India - 207 killedMarch 27, 2007 Tal Afar bombings and massacre in Iraq - 152 killed==Mass murder by a (S)/state== The concept of state-sponsored mass murder covers a range of potential killings. Some people consider any deaths in combat to be mass murder by the state,Murder By Communism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; though this is not a generally held position. Clear examples of state-sponsored mass murder include:Genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction of an ethnic, religious or national group. While precise definition varies among genocide scholars, the legal definition is found in the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). Since the CPPCG went into effect in 1951 there have been two genocides found to be so in international courts these were the Srebrenica genocide and the Rwandan Genocide (see International prosecution of genocide. There have been a number of other convictions for genocide under municipal laws, and a number of genocides in history &ndash; such as the Holocaust &ndash; are widely seen as genocides, but occurred before the universal acceptance of international laws defining and forbidding genocide was achieved in 1948, so those criminals who were convicted of taking part in these historical genocides were found guilty of crimes against humanity and other more specific crimes like murder.Political mass murder or the killing of a particular political group within a country, such as Béla Kun's ethnic cleansing against Turkish and Crimean Tatars and other minorities in 1921-22, Lenin's "Red Terror," Stalin's Great Purge, Mao's &quot;suppression of counterrevolutionaries,&quot; Pol Pot's Killing Fields, massacres at the partition of India, or the Hama, Jallianwala Bagh, and Tlatelolco massacres,Deliberate massacres of captives during wartime by a state's military forces, such as these committed by the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II: the Nanjing Massacre, the Katyn Forest Massacre of Polish citizens in 1940 and the massacres of political prisoners after the launch of Operation Barbarossa, the Three Alls Policy and the massacre of Soviet Jews at Babi Yar.Mass killing of civilians during total war, especially via strategic bombing, such as the Bombing of Chongqing, the Blitz, the bombing of Dresden and Hamburg, or the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Actions in which the state caused the death of large numbers of people, which political scientist R. J. Rummel calls "democide," which, in addition to the cases above, may include man-made disasters caused by the state, such as the Holodomor in the Soviet Union,R.J. Rummel.
