Srebrenica is a small mountain town, its main industry being salt mining and a nearby spa. During the Bosnian War, it was the site of the Srebrenica genocide. On March 24, 2007, Srebrenica's municipal assembly adopted a resolution demanding independence from the Republika Srpska; the Serb members of the assembly did not vote on the resolution. DemographicsIn 2005 there were about 4,000 Bosniaks in the municipality, about a third of the population.Year of censustotalMuslims]]SerbsCroatsYugoslavsothers199136,66627,572 (75.19%)8,315 (22.67%)38 (0.10%)380 (1.03%)361 (0.98%)198136,29224,930 (68.69%)10,294 (28.36%)80 (0.22%)602 (1.65%)386 (1.06%)197133,35720,968 (62.85%)11,918 (35.72%)109 (0.32%)121 (0.36%)241 (0.72%)196129,28314,565 (49.74%)12,540 (42.82%)71 (0.24%)1,967 (6.71%)195346,64723,545 (50.47%)106 (0.45%)22,791 (48.86%)194839,95420,195 (50.55%)52 (0.13%)19,671 (49.23%)19313521017,332 (49.2%)17766 (50.5%)103 (0.29%)The borders of the municipality in the 1953 and 1961 census were different. In 1953 Muslim by Nationality was not an option for the census, so the group called themselves Yugoslav. Yugoslav was not an option in 1948, so they were classified as other.The town of SrebrenicaYear of censustotalBosniaksSerbsCroatsYugoslavsothers19915,7463,673 (63.92%)1,632 (28.40%)34 (0.59%)328 (5.70%)79 (1.37%)EconomyBefore 1992, there was a metal factory in the town, and lead, zinc, and gold mines nearby. The town's name (Srebrenica) means "silver mine," the same meaning of its old Latin name Argentaria.Local communitiesThe municipality (општина or opština) is further subdivided into the following local communities (мјесне заједнице or mjesne zajednice):http://www.srebrenica-opstina.org/karta/karta.swf BrežaniCrvicaGostiljKostolomciKrnićiLukaOrahovicaOsaticaPodravanjePotočariRadoševićiRatkovićiSaseSkelaniSkenderovićiSrebrenicaSućeskaToplicaVijogorSrebrenica genocide During the War in Bosnia (1992&ndash;1995), the Srebrenica region saw heavy fighting. Hundreds of victims fell in the first years of the war, also among the civilian population. The town at the centre of the municipality became a Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak enclave surrounded by Serbs. In April 1993, the United Nations declared Srebrenica a UN safe area, guarded by a small unit operating under the mandate of United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The town was captured by the Army of Republika Srpska in July 1995, as it remained, along with Žepa and Goražde, the two remaining pockets of Muslim troops in Eastern Bosnia. Following the town's capture, approximately eight thousand (8 372) Bosniak men of fighting age were massacred by Serbian forces. All women, and men below 16 years of age and above 55, were sent by Serbian forces by bus to Tuzla. The remaining men were massacred. To this day, the Srebrenica Genocide remains one of the most brutal and shameful chapters in post-WWII European history, and the criminals responsible for it are currently being hunted http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25639691/.The Srebrenica genocide is referred to as a genocide by the judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm and the International Court of Justice. The decision of the ICTY was followed by an admission to and an apology for the massacre by the Republika Srpska government. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3999985.stmGallery Image:Srebrenica_landscape.JPG|Panorama of Srebrenica Image:Srebrenicaserb.jpg|The Orthodox church Image:Srebrenica_orthodox_int.JPG|Interior of the Orthodox church Image:Srebrenica_franciscan_chapel.JPG|The franciscan Catholic chapel Image:Srebrenica_Mosque.JPG|The White Mosque Image:Srebrenica_Seka.JPG|Fast Food Seka, on the place of a pre-1990s-war mosque (tombstones on the right) Image:Srebrenica_main_road.JPG|The main road toward west Image:Srebrenica_main_road_2.JPG|The main road from west toward the centre Image:Srebrenica_Stari_Grad.JPG|The old town (Stari Grad) Image:Srebrenica_Guber.JPG|Ruins of Mount Guber thermal centre Image:Srebrenica_Potocari_Memorial.JPG|Potocari Genocide Memorial Image:Srebrenica_Potocari_Memorial_2.JPG|Potocari Genocide Memorial   ==See also==Serbs of Bosnia and HerzegovinaSrebrenica GenocideBosnian GenocideHistory of Bosnia and HerzegovinaSrebrenica Genocide MemorialFiction stories about Srebrenica women: "Integration Under the Midnight Sun" by Adnan Mahmutovic http://www.theroseandthornezine.com/Summer07/Integration.htmlReferencesExternal linksOpština Srebrenica - Srebrenica Municipality Official site of a Bosnian NGO Citizens Associations &quot;Women of Srebrenica&quot; Category:Municipalities of Republika Srpska Category:Srebrenicaar:سربرنيتشا bs:Srebrenica bg:Сребреница ca:Srebrenica cs:Srebrenica da:Srebrenica de:Srebrenica et:Srebrenica es:Srebrenica eo:Srebrenica fr:Srebrenica hr:Srebrenica it:Srebrenica jv:Srebrenica lt:Srebrenica hu:Srebrenica nl:Srebrenica ja:スレブレニツァ no:Srebrenica pl:Srebrenica pt:Srebrenica ru:Сребреница sq:Srebrenica sl:Srebrenica sr:Сребреница sh:Srebrenica fi:Srebrenica sv:Srebrenica tr:Srebrenitza zh:斯雷布雷尼察
