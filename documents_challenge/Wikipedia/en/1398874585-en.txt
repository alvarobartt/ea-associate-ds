The Lady Orchid (Orchis purpurea) is an orchid from the family Orchidaceae.Range and habitatThis orchid can be found in most parts of Europe, northern Africa, Turkey, and the Caucasus. Lady orchids usually grow in woodlands, but occasionally occur on savanna. They prefer limestone or chalk soil.DescriptionFlowering occurs in late April to June. The Lady Orchid's flower spike can grow to 100 cm in height and is densely covered with up to 50 flowers. The sepals and upper petals are dark red or black. The flower's labellum is pale pink or white, with a center spotted by clusters of dark red hairs. It is divided into three lobes; the outer two are small and narrow, and the inner is large, rounded, and heart-shaped.The leaves are broad and oval-shaped, forming a rosette about the base of the plant and surrounding the flower spike. They are bright green, and can be up to 15 cm long.IdentificationThe Lady Orchid may be mistaken for the Military Orchid or Monkey Orchid. The three species often hybridize, making them difficult to identify, although the shape of the labellum is distinct to each species.ThreatsDeer, especially the Muntjac, and slugs are among the greatest threats to this orchid. Human activity - picking flowers or uprooting plants - is also a concern.ReferencesBritain's OrchidsBritish Wild Flowers GalleryTiscali Reference: Wildlife Category:Orchid speciesco:Orchis purpurea de:Purpur-Knabenkraut es:Orchis purpurea fr:Orchis pourpre hsb:Bahorowa pihawka it:Orchis purpurea hu:Bíbor kosbor nl:Purperorchis pl:Storczyk purpurowy sl:Škrlatnordeča kukavica
