Coligny is a commune, near Bourg-en-Bresse in the department of Ain in eastern France.Celtic backgroundColigny is famed for its Celtic lunisolar calendar, the "Coligny calendar". The calendar, which dates from the turn of the 1st century, has been key in the understanding of the knowledge of astronomy among the Gauls, and also supplied interesting information about their language (e.g., their names for months and the words for "lucky" and "unlucky"). It was an engraved bronze tablet originally discovered as fragments in 1897. http://www.roman-britain.org/celtic/coligny.htm Roman-Britain.org It is written in the Latin alphabet and it represents a five-year cycle composed of three years having twelve lunar months and two years (the first and third) having thirteen lunar months.At the end of the 19th century a bronze statue was discovered in the town and has been christened the Dieu de Coligny (God of Coligny).MiscellaneousColigny was the birthplace of Joseph Darnand (1897-1945), a French pro-Nazi traitor and leader of the Vichy French Milice.See alsoCommunes of the Ain departmentReferences Based on the article in the French Wikipedia.External linksOfficial siteThe almanac of ColignyCategory:communes of Ainar:كولينيي، أين frp:Colignê ceb:Coligny de:Coligny (Ain) es:Coligny fr:Coligny (Ain) it:Coligny pam:Coligny, Ain nl:Coligny pl:Coligny pt:Coligny (Ain) sr:Coligny vi:Coligny, Ain vo:Coligny (Ain)
