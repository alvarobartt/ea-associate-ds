Aged 16 he left for Germany to join the youth team of 1860 München, one of the two big teams located in Bavaria's capital Munich (the other one being Bayern München). Two years later Linz returned to Austria to rejoin his home team DSV Leoben, this time being featured in the professional squad, to be recruited by one of the country's major football teams, Viennese club Austria Wien, after 2 more years.
