 Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular human pathogen, is one of three bacterial species in the genus Chlamydia, family Chlamydiaceae, class Chlamydiae, phylum Chlamydiae, domain Bacteria. C. trachomatis cannot be stained with the Gram stain (it is Gram negative).C. trachomatis was the first chlamydial agent discovered in humans. It was identified in 1907.It comprises three human biovars: Urethritis (serovars D-K), trachoma (serovars A, B, Ba or C) and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV, serovars L1, 2 and 3)).Many, but not all, C. trachomatis strains have an extrachromosomal plasmid.Clinical significanceIt has only been found living inside the cells of humans, causing the following conditions:In menProstatitisEpididymitisIn womenCervicitisPelvic inflammatory disease (PID)Ectopic pregnancyPelvic pain, chronic or acuteNewborn eye (trachoma) or lung infectionIn both sexesUrethritisInfertilityProctitis (rectal disease and bleeding)Reactive arthritisTrachomaC. trachomatis has also been detected in some patients with temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ).It may be treated with any of several antibiotics: azithromycin, erythromycin or doxycycline/tetracycline.IdentificationChlamydia species are readily identified and distinguished from other chlamydial species using DNA-based tests.Most strains of C. trachomatis are recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to epitopes in the VS4 region of MOMP. However, these mAbs may also crossreact with the other two Chlamydia species, Chlamydia suis and Chlamydia muridarum.ReferencesExternal linksChlamydiae.com http://www.chlamydiae.com/docs/Chlamydiales/genus_chlamydia.aspCategory:Chlamydiaeda:Klamydia de:Chlamydia trachomatis es:Chlamydia trachomatis fr:Chlamydia trachomatis id:Chlamydia trachomatis it:Chlamydia trachomatis nl:Chlamydia trachomatis ja:クラミジア・トラコマチス no:Chlamydia trachomatis pl:Chlamydia trachomatis pt:Chlamydia trachomatis ru:Хламидия трахоматис vi:Chlamydia trachomatis tr:Chlamydia trachomatis uk:Chlamydia trachomatis
