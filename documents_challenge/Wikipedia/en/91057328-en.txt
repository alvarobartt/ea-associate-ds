I am originally from Malauc&egrave;ne, a village located in Provence (South of France) at the foot of Mont Ventoux. It was a great place to grow up and still a great place to visit and spend the summer. It is the perfect size, not too small (we have banks, shops, etc) and not too big (2,500 habitants + tourists). It is hot with a little breeze during the summer. The outside market every Wednesday morning is a must-see with its local merchants selling olives, salamis, potteries, handicraft, clothes and more &quot;food items&quot;. They all want you to taste their products and speak with you. In France, it is all about the food and the wine. Malauc&egrave;ne has many restaurants, caf&eacute;s and wineries. You can also enjoy the summer festivals and outdoor balls (free). Many places exhibit local artists especially painters. The village itself dates from the 10th century so you can visit Medieval, Gallic and Roman structures (even prehistoric vestiges). This is an old village with lots of charm and beautiful building details. The best views are by far on top of the Calv&egrave;re located in the middle of the older part of town. It is a climb but the access is free and worth the walk.
