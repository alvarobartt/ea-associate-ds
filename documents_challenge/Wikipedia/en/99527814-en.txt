Tignes () is a commune of the Savoie département, in France.It is also a ski resort near Val d'Isère in the "Espace Killy" region.VillagesTignes comprises 5 Villages; Val Claret, Tignes le Lac, Le Lavachet, Tignes Les Boisses and Tignes-les-Brévières. The first three are close together at 2100m and Les Boisses and Les Brevieres are further down the valley, above and below the dam respectively. Les Brévières is an old village whereas all the others were created as part of the Dam construction or development of the ski resort. All villages are part of the ski resort known as Tignes.The Dam (barrage de Tignes)The original village of Tignes was in the Isère valley below Val d'Isère. After the second world war, France needed electricity and it was decided to build a hydro-electric dam in the Isère valley. Whilst this was a great achievement for French engineering and was for the greater good of France, it very sadly meant that the old village of Tignes was drowned. The dam was completed and the village was consigned to the waters in 1952. A replica of the original church was created in Tignes les Boisses. Once every 10 years the lake behind the dam (Lac du Chevril) is drained for maintenance work and the remains of the old village become visible.The dam was painted with a fresco of Hercules in 1989 by Jean-Marie Pierret with the help of eight mountain climbers. The fresco is considered one of the largest in the world. The portrait of Hercules was added and funded by private corporations interested in boosting the Olympic appeal during the winter games of 1992 which took place in nearby Albertville, France WORKS IN PROGRESS; That Dammed Hercules By Bruce Weber - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.Photo of the dam can be seen here: http://deputy-dog.com/2008/06/25/how-to-disguise-an-industrial-eyesore/The Ski ResortAfter the loss of the old village it was decided to develop a ski resort at the higher lake (Le Lac). This was surrounded by a bowl that is ideal for skiing and is headed by the Grand Motte glacier. The resort was developed largely during the 1960s and the building style reflects what was regarded as good building design at that time. In recent years the town has worked hard to improve the look of the new villages with some success.The lift company STGM are continually investing to improve the quality of lifts in the resort and queues are mostly avoided by the use of fast 6- or 8-person chairs. They have also invested over the past few years in snow making equipment to create good bases for the pistes even in the early season.Grande Motte glacierDue to presence of the Grande Motte glacier, Tignes used to offer year-round skiing. However, the glacier has been receding over the last decades and now closes for a few weeks each year. As of 2005 the glacier had shrunk by around 25 vertical metres (80 feet) compared to a 1982 survey. It seems likely that the glacier will eventually be split into two by the rock spurs which are starting to become visible.Tour de FranceIn 2007, Tignes was the finish of stage 8 of the Tour de France. The climb from Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise to the finish at the lake is 17.9 km long at an average gradient of 5.5% and is ranked as a Category 1 climb.Tour de France stage finishesYearStageCategoryStage winnerYellow jersey2007]]81Michael RasmussenMichael RasmussenSee alsoTignes-les-BrévièresList of ski areas and resorts in EuropeReferencesExternal linksTignes websitePhoto gallery of TignesWebcams in TignesUnofficial Resort Information WebsiteUnofficial Tignes websiteTignes Specialist Chalet Operatorinformation on Le Lavachet , tignes info on lavachetProfile of climbTignes Snow reportCategory:1992 Winter Olympics venues Category:2007 Tour de France Category:Communes of Savoie Category:Ski areas and resorts in France Category:Savoieceb:Tignes de:Tignes es:Tignes fr:Tignes gl:Tignes it:Tignes la:Tignes nl:Tignes no:Tignes pl:Tignes pt:Tignes ro:Tignes fi:Tignes
