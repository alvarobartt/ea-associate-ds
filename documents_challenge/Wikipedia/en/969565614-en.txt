It should not be confused with a new small city Zabol in Irani Afghan border.Political and security situation.With its sparse population, insecure border with Pakistan and little central authority, Zabul is a fertile ground for insurgents fighting against the current Afghan government, although the province is considered more secure than some of its southern neighbours http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.wxafghan23/BNStory/International/home. The province has especially struggled with retaining NGO's and teachers in the face of Taliban attacks and threats.
