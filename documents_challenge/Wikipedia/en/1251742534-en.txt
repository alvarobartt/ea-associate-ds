 Europa Universalis (EU) is a grand strategy video game released in 2000 by Paradox Entertainment and distributed in North America by Strategy First. Originally based on a French board game of the same name by Philippe Thibault, Europa Universalis lets the player take control of one of seven European nations (others are available in different scenarios) from 1492 to 1792, expanding its power through military might, diplomacy, and colonial wealth. The game takes place on a map divided into approximately 1,500 provinces, and proceeds in a pausable real time format. The lead game programmer was Johan Andersson.The game became a surprise hit for its depth and strategy. Paradox used this sudden success to springboard other successful titles such as Victoria, Crusader Kings, and Hearts of Iron.Europa Universalis was followed by Europa Universalis II and Europa Universalis III as well as the Europa Universalis: Rome.See alsoEuropa Universalis IIEuropa Universalis IIIEuropa Universalis: RomeExternal linksOfficial home pageOfficial forumEuropa Universalis II wikiReview at Total Gamer ZoneReview at Tea LeavesCategory:2000 video games Category:Age of Discovery video games Category:Grand strategy video games Category:Paradox Interactive games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Windows gamesbe-x-old:Europa Universalis de:Europa Universalis es:Europa Universalis fr:Europa Universalis it:Europa Universalis lt:Europa Universalis nl:Europa Universalis pl:Europa Universalis pt:Europa Universalis ru:Europa Universalis fi:Europa Universalis sv:Europa Universalis uk:Europa Universalis
