 Mando Diao is a garage rock band from Borlänge, Sweden.OriginThe roots of Mando Diao date back to 1995 when Björn Dixgård and the former Mando Diao-member Daniel Haglund were in a band called Butler. Band members came and went and four years later the rest of the current line-up decided to take that project more seriously. Björn Dixgård and Gustaf Norén locked themselves up in a summer house and spent 14 months writing songs. They claim the Beatles as their original source of inspiration. Actually, Gustaf joined after he and Björn had talked all night about them. The two renamed their band Mando Diao. According to the band, the name has no particular meaning, and it appeared to band member Björn Dixgård in a dream.RecordingsThe now-renamed band made their first public performances in the clubs of their hometown Borlänge in 1999. A local writer described them in an article as the best unsigned band he had ever seen. This was soon followed by a record deal with EMI Sweden. In 2002 their first album Bring 'Em In was released in Sweden. It contains early demo versions of their songs, partly recorded in the basement of keyboardist Daniel Haglund who left the band later in 2003. In 2003 the album was released internationally, along with their debut single "Sheepdog." As of 2004, the band is hailed enthusiastically by the music press as one of the most sanguine newcomer bands of the year. The album Hurricane Bar was released in 2004. Their third album Ode to Ochrasy was released in 2006. By the end of 2006 the band released a DVD called "Down in the Past". 'Ode to Ochrasy' was released in the UK through the Nettwerk label on 2nd April 2007 in a previously unreleased format including 4 bonus tracks. In October the band released their newest album, Never Seen The Light Of Day.TouringMando Diao have been touring all over the world, though their biggest following is in Germany, Japan and their homeland Sweden. The band supported The Bravery on their tour in 2005, along with Los Angeles band The Colour. On their 2006 European tour, they were supported by Razorlight and Johnossi, and for the British leg of the tour were a joint support act for the Dirty Pretty Things along with Larrikin Love.At the end of January 2007, Mando Diao was widely exposed in Swedish media because of an incidentFloor Collapse At Sweden’s Amplified Festival at their live concert on 27th January, 2007. They were performing at the Amplified festival at Norrlands Opera House in Umeå, when a part of the floor the audience was standing on collapsed, leaving at least 25 fans hurt - five people were taken to the hospital with injuries such as broken arms and legs. According to the management of Norrlandsoperan, the hall had been checked, but they had never thought the floor, which was made up by several moveable parts on concrete girders over a three meter deep hole, wouldn't hold the 170 people in the room, not least since the fire department had given them approval for 800 people. After this unfortunate event, Mando Diao stayed around in Umeå in case they could do anything to help the injured fans. They visited the hospitalized fans personally. Mando Diao is planning to hold another concert to make up for what was lost that evening in January 2007.Mando Diao appeared April 29, 2007 at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festivalhttp://www.coachella.com/event/lineup/mando-diao and on 7 July, 2007 they performed at the German leg of Live Earthhttp://liveearth.msn.com/artists/mandodiao in Hamburg.Mando Diao singer Björn Dixgård toured Europe solo during the end of 2007.So far confirmed gigs for 2008 include Sweden, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan.DiscographyAlbumsBring 'Em In 2002Hurricane Bar September 22 2004Ode To Ochrasy August 25, 2006Never Seen the Light of Day October 24, 2007EPsMotown Blood EP - 2002 (Sweden)Sheepdog EP - 2003 (Japan)Paralyzed EP - 2004 (Sweden, US & UK)Japan Tour EP - 2004 (Japan)Long Before Rock 'N' Roll EP - 2006 (US)German Tour EP - 2007 (US)The Wildfire (If It Was True) EP - 2007 (US)SinglesYearSongUKSwedenSwissATAlbum2002Mr. Moon&mdash;33&mdash;&mdash;Bring 'Em InThe Band&mdash;52&mdash;&mdash;2003Sheepdog&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;2004Clean Town&mdash;29&mdash;&mdash;Hurricane BarGod Knows&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Paralyzed (UK)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Bring 'Em InDown In The Past&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Hurricane Bar2005You Can't Steal My Love (UK)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;God Knows (UK)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;You Can't Steal My Love&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;2006Long Before Rock 'N' Roll&mdash;166953Ode to OchrasyGood Morning, Herr Horst&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;2007TV &amp; Me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Wildfire (If It Was True)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Ochrasy&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If I Don't Live Today, &lt;br&gt; I Might Be Here Tomorrow&mdash;15&mdash;&mdash;Never Seen the Light of DayNever Seen the Light of Day&mdash;34&mdash;&mdash;Compilations"God Knows" was featured on FIFA 06 by EA Sports."Down in the Past" was featured on 2006 Fifa World Cup Germany by EA Sports, and NHL 06 by EA Sports"The Wildfire (If It Was True) was featured on NHL 08 by EA Sports."Sheepdog" was featured in E4's teen drama "Skins" (UK)"Sweet Ride" was featured in the 2005 film The Ringer"Long Before Rock and Roll" featured in E4 Scrubs advert Autumn 2007DVDsDown In The Past (2006)Videography"Mr. Moon" (2002/directed by Magnus Härdner, produced by Christoffer Sahlgren)"The Band" (2002/directed by Håkan Schüler)"Sheepdog" (2003/directed by Pontus Andersson"Paralyzed" (2003/directed by Håkan Schüler)"Clean Town" (2004/directed by Amir Chamdin)"God Knows" (2004/directed by Johan Torell & John Nordqvist)"Down In The Past" (2004/directed by Christoffer Diös)"You Can't Steal My Love" (2005/directed by Mauricio Molinari)"Long Before Rock'n'Roll" (2006/directed by Daniel Eskils)"Good Morning, Herr Horst" (2006/directed by Lovisa Inserra)"TV & Me" (2006/directed by Kalle Haglund)"Wildfire" (2007/directed by Gilly Barnes)"Ochrasy" (2007/directed by Lovisa Inserra)"If I Don't Live Today, I Might Be Here Tomorrow" (2007/directed by Andreas Nilsson)ReferencesExternal linksThe Official Mando Diao WebsiteThe Supporter Club13 songs chosen by and an interview with Mando Diao on Klangschau.comCategory:Swedish indie rock groups Category:garage punk Category:Artists from Dalarnaast:Mando Diao ca:Mando Diao de:Mando Diao es:Mando Diao eu:Mando Diao fr:Mando Diao gl:Mando Diao hr:Mando Diao it:Mando Diao lb:Mando Diao nl:Mando Diao ja:マンドゥ・ディアオ pl:Mando Diao pt:Mando Diao ru:Mando Diao sk:Mando Diao fi:Mando Diao sv:Mando Diao
