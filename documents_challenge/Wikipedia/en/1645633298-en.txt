He signed for the club in 1988, after spending two seasons at Atlético Madrid, and subsequently linked up with several other Basque players, including José Ramón Alexanko, Txiki Beguiristain, Goikoetxea and José Mari Bakero. Together they would form the backbone of the legendary Dream Team. Among the highlights of his time at FC Barcelona were scoring in both the European Cup Winners Cup final in 1989 against Sampdoria and in the Copa del Rey final in 1990 against Real Madrid.Deportivo de La CoruñaAfter leaving FC Barcelona, Salinas went on to play for Deportivo de La Coruña, helping them finish second in La Liga in 1995. He was not a regular in the starting line-up but, following his tradition Julito scored 12 goals. In La Coruña he is well remembered for scoring a late equaliser against FC Barcelona in Camp Nou. It was his first visit after leaving FC Barcelona and Julio Salinas came on as a substitute with just 13 minutes to go. Close to the end of the match there was a corner and after a header from José Luis Ribera, central defender of Deportivo de La Coruña, Julio managed to score the goal which was giving a point to Deportivo de La Coruña.Sporting de GijónNew signings of Deportivo de La Coruña meant less chances for Julio Salinas, Dmitry Radchenko one of them. Due to his chances decreasing Julio Salinas left for Sporting de Gijón (1995-97) where he stayed before leaving to Japan. Julio Salinas was very loved in Gijón and the fans of the team used to sign: "Bota de oro, Salinas bota de oro" (Golden boot, Salinas, golden boot".Yokohama MarinosSalinas stayed slightly more than a season at Yokohama Marinos, now called Yokohama Flügels Marinos, formed after the fussion between Yokohama Marinos and Yokohama Flügels. And also in Japan Salinas again showed his scoring skills.Deportivo AlavésAfter his experience in Japan Salinas came back to Spain to play in a team close from his home in Bilbao. The team was Alavés. At Alavés he played his last two seasons as a professional footballer(1998- 2000). His last match was against his first team, Athletic, and Salinas scored his last goal in that game.National teamSalinas made 56 international appearances for Spain between 1986 and 1996, scoring 22 goals.
