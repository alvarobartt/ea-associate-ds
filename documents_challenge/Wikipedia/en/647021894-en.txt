Lebowa was a bantustan located in the Transvaal in north eastern South Africa. Seshego initially acted as Lebowa's capital while the purpose-built Lebowakgomo was being constructed. Granted internal self-government on October 2 1972 and ruled for much of its existence by Cedric Phatudi, Lebowa was reincorporated into South Africa in 1994. It became part of the Limpopo province.Even though Lebowa was seen as a home for the Northern Sotho speaking Tribes, it was also home for various non Northern Sotho Speaking tribes, including the Northern Ndebeles, Batswana and VhaTsonga.For its size, Lebowa had a relatively large number of Teacher Training Colleges.==See also==Chief Ministers of Lebowa Category:South African bantustansca:Lebowa de:Lebowa es:Lebowa fr:Lebowa he:לבווה nl:Lebowa pl:Lebowa pt:Lebowa ru:Лебова fi:Lebowa zh:萊博瓦
