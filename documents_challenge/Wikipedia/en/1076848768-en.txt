He is a right back/right wing-back who is known for his pace and constant overlapping runs.CareerA great fan of PSG since his childhood, Mendy achieved his ambitions in 2000 when he joined PSG from SM Caen. Even though he had impressed a lot of people by his qualities during his first two seasons at PSG, he was loaned to Bolton Wanderers of England for a year, where he was appreciated for his offensive and speedy style.When he came back from England in 2003, the new manager of PSG, Vahid Halilhodzic, decided to give him an opportunity to assert himself by using him as a first choice. That year, Mendy played one of his best seasons and was rewarded by playing his first match with the French national team against Brazil. Even though he was injured and had some troubles in the 2004-05 season, Mendy is still considered one of the best French right wing defenders, mainly due to his clinical crosses. However, he was not selected for the country's 2006 FIFA World Cup roster. In 2008, he scored the decisive goal in the final of the Coupe de la Ligue against RC Lens in a 2-1 victory, calmly stroking the ball home from the penalty spot.Mendy had stated his desire to play to return to the English Premier League to play for his favourite football club, Manchester United. Instead, on June 20 2008, it was reported by BBC Radio Humberside that Hull City had offered Mendy a three-year deal to join the newly promoted English club. He accepted the offer and joined Hull City for training in Italy. Hull manager Phil Brown had been assistant manager at Bolton during Mendy's time there.HonoursFrench Cup : 2006, 2004, PSGFrench Coupe de la Ligue : 2008, PSGU-18 European Championship : 2000Best Ligue 1 right wing defender UNFP : 2004First selection with the French national team : May 20, 2004ReferencesExternal linksBernard Mendy profile on Hull City official website Stats at soccerbase.comUEFA profile Career stats Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Football (soccer) fullbacks Category:French footballers Category:France international footballers Category:SM Caen players Category:Paris Saint-Germain players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Hull City A.F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:French people of Senegalese descentde:Bernard Mendy es:Bernard Mendy fr:Bernard Mendy it:Bernard Mendy nl:Bernard Mendy ja:ベルナール・メンディ pl:Bernard Mendy
