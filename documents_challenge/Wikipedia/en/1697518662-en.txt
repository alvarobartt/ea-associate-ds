Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet (Soignies (Belgium) 13 June, 1870 &ndash; 6 April, 1961) was a Belgian immunologist and microbiologist. The bacterial genus Bordetella is named for him.BiographyBallin of Medicine at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Brussels, Belgium) and began his work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1894, where, in the laboratory of Elie Metchnikoff, he described phagocytosis of bacteria by white blood cells. In 1898 he described hemolysis evoked by exposure of blood serum to foreign blood cells.In 1900, he left Paris to found the Pasteur Institute in Brussels, and made his discovery that the bacteriolytic effect of acquired specific antibody is significantly enhanced in vivo by the presence of innate serum components which he termed alexine (but which are now known as complement). This mechanism became the basis for complement-fixation testing methods that enabled the development of serological tests for syphilis (specifically, the development of the Wassermann test by August von Wassermann). The same technique is used today in serologic testing for countless other diseases.With Octave Gengou he isolated Bordetella pertussis in pure culture in 1906 and posited it as the cause of whooping cough. He became Professor of Bacteriology at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles in 1907.The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity.On his passing in 1961, Jules Bordet was interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels. He was a freemason and member of the lodge Les Amis Philanthropes of the Grand Orient of Belgium in Brussels.See alsoInstitut Jules BordetExternal linksJules BordetThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1919Jules Bordet InstituteJules Bordet Museum  Category:Belgian biologists Category:Belgian academics Category:Immunologists Category:Belgian microbiologists Category:Belgian Nobel laureates Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:Free University of Brussels alumni Category:1870 births Category:1961 deathsar:جول بورديه ca:Jules Bordet cs:Jules Bordet da:Jules Bordet de:Jules Bordet es:Jules Bordet fr:Jules Bordet ko:쥘 보르데 hr:Jules Bordet id:Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet it:Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet sw:Jules Bordet nl:Jules Bordet ja:ジュール・ボルデ oc:Jules Bordet pl:Jules Bordet pt:Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet ro:Jules Bordet ru:Борде, Жюль sl:Jules Bordet fi:Jules Bordet sv:Jules Bordet uk:Борде Жуль zh:朱爾·博爾代
