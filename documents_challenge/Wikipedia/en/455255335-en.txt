CAS registry numbers are unique numerical identifiers for chemical compounds, polymers, biological sequences, mixtures and alloys. They are also referred to as CAS numbers, CAS RNs or CAS #s.Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, assigns these identifiers to every chemical that has been described in the literature. The intention is to make database searches more convenient, as chemicals often have many names. Almost all molecule databases today allow searching by CAS number.As of January 2008, there were 33,565,050 organic and inorganic substances and 59,584,048 sequences in the CAS registry.CAS Registry Number and Substance Counts Around 50,000 new numbers are added each week.CAS also maintains and sells a database of these chemicals, known as the CAS registry.FormatA CAS registry number is separated by hyphens into three parts, the first consisting of up to 7 digits, the second consisting of two digits, and the third consisting of a single digit serving as a check digit. The numbers are assigned in increasing order and do not have any inherent meaning. The checksum is calculated by taking the last digit times 1, the next digit times 2, the next digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10. For example, the CAS number of water is 7732-18-5: the checksum is calculated as (8&times;1 + 1&times;2 + 2&times;3 + 3&times;4 + 7&times;5 + 7&times;6) = 105; 105 mod 10 = 5.The Chemical Abstracts Service has announced on its web site that it will add an additional digit to new CAS registry numbers, starting about January 2008.Isomers, enzymes, and mixturesDifferent stereoisomers of a molecule receive different CAS numbers: D-glucose has 50-99-7, L-glucose has 921-60-8, α-D-glucose has 26655-34-5, etc. Occasionally, whole classes of molecules receive a single CAS number: the group of alcohol dehydrogenases has 9031-72-5. An example of a mixture with a CAS number is mustard oil (8007-40-7).SearchesWhen using CAS numbers for database searches, it is useful to include the numbers of closely related compounds. For instance, to search for information about cocaine (CAS 50-36-2), one should consider including cocaine hydrochloride (CAS 53-21-4), since that is the most common form of cocaine when used as a drug.See alsoEC number (Enzyme Commission)EC# (EINECS and ELINCS)International Chemical Identifier (InChI)PubChemSMILESUN numberChemical databaseNotes See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the  and  tags, and the template below. -- External linksCAS registry description, by the Chemical Abstracts ServiceTo find the CAS number of a compound given its name, formula or structure, the following free resources can be used:Chemical Synthesis DatabasePubChemNIH ChemIDplusNIST Chemistry WebBookR&amp;D ChemicalsNCI Database BrowserChemfinderChemSub Online (Multilingual chemical names)European chemical Substances Information System (ESIS) - useful for finding EC#NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, index of CAS numbersCategory:Chemical numbering schemes Category:American Chemical Societyar:رقم التسجيل CAS bs:CAS registarski broj br:Niverenn CAS ca:Nombre CAS cs:Registrační číslo CAS da:CAS-nummer de:CAS-Nummer es:Número CAS eu:CAS erregistro zenbaki fa:شماره ثبت CAS fr:Numéro CAS gl:Número CAS ko:CAS 등록번호 it:Numero CAS he:מספר CAS hu:CAS-szám nl:CAS-nummer ja:CAS登録番号 no:CAS-nummer nn:CAS-nummer pl:Numer CAS pt:Registro CAS ru:Регистрационный номер CAS sk:Registračné číslo CAS sr:ЦАС регистарски број fi:CAS-numero sv:CAS-nummer ta:CAS எண் th:เลขทะเบียน CAS vi:Số đăng ký CAS tr:CAS kayıt numarası ur:کیمیائی شعبۂ اخلاص اندراجی عدد zh:CAS号
