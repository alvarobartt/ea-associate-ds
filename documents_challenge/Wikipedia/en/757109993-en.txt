The Malay Peninsula or Thai-Malay Peninsula () () is a major peninsula located in Southeast Asia. It is also known as the Kra Peninsula and runs approximately north-south through the Kra Isthmus.The coastal waters are (clockwise from northeast) the Gulf of Thailand, the South China Sea (opposite Borneo), the Straits of Johor (opposite Singapore), the Straits of Singapore (along Singapore's western coasts), the Straits of Malacca (opposite Sumatra) and the Andaman Sea.The area is divided politically:the northwest is the extreme south part of Myanmar (Burma)the central region and northeast is the south part of Thailandthe south is the part of Malaysia called Peninsular Malaysia or West Malaysia (which should not be confused with the larger Malay Peninsula).The Malay term Tanah Melayu is still occasionally used in political discourse to describe uniting all Malay people on the peninsula under one Malay nation, although this ambition was largely realized with the creation of Malaysia. There however remains a Malay majority in southern Thailand, as the area was formerly part of the Pattani kingdom, a Malay kingdom. There is also a Malay minority in Singapore, an island country with a Chinese majority that came to the island as immigrants during the British colonial era and began to develop into a major city when the British leased the island from the Sultanate of Johor in 1819.The west coast of the peninsula was especially popular among seafaring Bugis, Chinese and Indians as a stopover, leading to increased migration of the people to set up visible coastal settlements in the thirteenth century.The Malay Peninsula may have been the peninsula recorded as Chersonesus Aurea in Roman times.See alsoMalay archipelagoTitiwangsa MountainsKra IsthmusIndochinaCategory:Peninsulas of Asia Category:Geography of Southeast Asiabs:Malajsko poluostrvo bg:Малака ca:Península de Malacca cv:Малай çурутравĕ cs:Malajský poloostrov da:Malayahalvøen de:Malaiische Halbinsel et:Malaka poolsaar es:Península de Malaca eo:Malaja duoninsulo eu:Malaysiar penintsula fa:شبه جزیره مالایا fr:Péninsule Malaise ko:말레이 반도 hr:Malajski poluotok id:Semenanjung Melayu is:Malakkaskagi it:Penisola malese he:חצי האי המלאי sw:Rasi ya Malay lt:Malakos pusiasalis nl:Malakka (schiereiland) ja:マレー半島 no:Malayahalvøya nn:Malayahalvøya km:ឧបទ្វីបម៉ាឡេ pl:Półwysep Malajski pt:Península da Malásia ru:Малакка (полуостров) simple:Malay Peninsula sl:Malajski polotok sh:Malajski poluotok fi:Malakan niemimaa sv:Malackahalvön th:คาบสมุทรมลายู vi:Bán đảo Mã Lai tr:Malay Yarımadası uk:Малакка wuu:马来亚半岛 zh:马来半岛
