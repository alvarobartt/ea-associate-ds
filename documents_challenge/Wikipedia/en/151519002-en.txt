The city was completely destroyed by earthquake in 1797, but rebuilt a few years later 14 km (9 miles) away from its original location (near a village named Cajabamba in the plains of San Antonio de Aguíscate). The city still retains much architecture from the Spanish period.In the Ecuadorian War of Independence Riobamba first declared independence on November 11, 1820 but was soon retaken.
