Puck was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 1985-12-30, and was given the temporary designation S/1985&nbsp;U&nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;In Celtic mythology and English folklore, a Puck is a mischievous sprite, imagined as an evil demon by Christians; the moon is named after the Puck who appears in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, like a little sprite who travels around the globe at night with the fairies. It is also designated Uranus&nbsp;XV.&lt;/ref&gt;Puck is the largest of small inner satellites of Uranus. It is intermediate in size between Portia and Miranda, the smallest of the five larger satellites. Puck's orbit is also located between these two moons. Little is known about it aside from its orbit, its radius about 81 km, and its geometric albedo approximately 0.11.Of the moons discovered by the Voyager&nbsp;2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axises is 0.97 ± 0.04).. Its surface is heavily cratered&lt;/ref&gt; and is grey in color. There are three named craters on the surface of Puck. Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesExternal linksPuck Profile by NASA's Solar System ExplorationSee alsoPage that includes a reprocessed version of the Voyager Puck imageList of craters on PuckCategory:Uranus' moonsbs:Pak (mjesec) bg:Пък (спътник) cs:Puck (měsíc) cy:Puck (lloeren) da:Puck (måne) de:Puck (Mond) es:Puck (luna) fr:Puck (lune) hr:Pak it:Puck (astronomia) he:פוק ht:Pik lt:Pukas (palydovas) nl:Puck (maan) ja:パック (衛星) no:Puck (måne) nn:Uranusmånen Puck nds:Puck (Maand) pl:Puk (księżyc) pt:Puck ru:Пак (спутник) simple:Puck (moon) sk:Puck (mesiac) sl:Puk (luna) fi:Puck (kuu) sv:Puck (måne) zh:天卫十五
