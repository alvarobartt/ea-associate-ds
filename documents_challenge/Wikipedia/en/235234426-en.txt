In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music."&lt;/ref&gt;Early lifeMichael Trent Reznor was born in Mercer, Pennsylvania (halfway between Pittsburgh and Erie) to Michael Joseph Reznor and Nancy Lou Clark on May 17, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reznor was referred to by his middle name to avoid confusion with his father.  After his parents divorced, he lived with his grandparents, while his sister Tera lived with their mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bleak&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Reznor has acknowledged that his sheltered life in Pennsylvania left him feeling isolated from the outside world. In a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he makes reference to his choices in the music industry. | However, Reznor later said, "I don't want to give the impression it was a miserable childhood".&lt;/ref&gt;At the Mercer Area Junior and Senior High Schools, Reznor learned to play the saxophone and tuba. He was a member of both the jazz and marching band. Former Mercer High School band director Dr. Hendley Hoge remembered Reznor as "very upbeat and friendly".&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor also became involved in theater while in high school. He was voted &quot;Best in Drama&quot; by classmates for his roles as [[Judas]] in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and Professor Harold Hill in ''[[The Music Man]]''.  Reznor graduated from this high school in 1983 and enrolled at [[Allegheny College]], where he studied [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Film Spot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Early musical projects's self-titled album.]]While he was enrolled in Allegheny College, Reznor joined local band Option 30, playing three shows a week with them. But after only a year of college, Reznor dropped out and moved to Cleveland, Ohio in order to pursue a career in music. In 1985, he joined The Innocent as a keyboardist. They released one album, Livin' in the Street, but Reznor quit after just three months. In 1986, Reznor joined local band Exotic Birds. He also appeared with them as the fictional band "The Problems" in the 1987 film Light of Day.&lt;/ref&gt;Reznor got a job at Right Track Studio (now known as Midtown Recording) as an assistant engineer and janitor.&lt;/ref&gt; Studio owner Bart Koster later commented that Reznor was &quot;so focused in everything he [did]. When that guy waxed the floor, it looked great.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;int12&quot;/&gt; Reznor asked Koster for permission to record [[Demo (music)|demos]] of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him &quot;just a little wear on [his] tape heads&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;int12&quot; /&gt; While assembling these, the earliest NIN recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], he played all the instruments except drums himself.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material, and Reznor signed with [[TVT Records]].&lt;ref name= &quot;AMG&quot; /&gt; Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1994 as ''Purest Feeling''; many of these songs would appear in revised form on ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' in 1989 under the name Nine Inch Nails.Nine Inch Nails  festival, 1991.]] Nine Inch Nails' debut album, Pretty Hate Machine was released in 1989. It was a moderate commercial success, and was certified Gold in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amid pressure from Reznor's record label to produce a follow-up to ''Pretty Hate Machine'', Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference, resulting in the ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'' EP, released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 1991 Nine Inch Nails was included in the [[Lollapalooza]] package tour. They later won a [[Grammy]] in 1993 for the song [[Wish (song)|Wish]] in the Best Heavy Metal Performance category.&lt;ref name&quot;Lollapalooza&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 in 1994 at number two,&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  To record the album, Reznor rented and moved into the [[10050 Cielo Drive]] mansion, site of the 1969 [[Manson Family]] murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le PUG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Reznor built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the message scrawled on the front door with [[Sharon Tate]]'s blood by her murderers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Pig&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because, &quot;I looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Pig&quot; /&gt;  Reznor took the front door of the house with him when he moved out, installing it at Nothing Studios, his new recording studio/record label headquarters in New Orleans.The Downward Spiral was a critical and commercial success.

Reznor went on to say that as &quot;the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reznor Smashes UMG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on Universal Music Group at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to &quot;steal&quot; his music online instead of purchasing it legally.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to &quot;steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Trent Reznor announced later that Nine Inch Nails split from its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and will distribute its next major albums independently.

The seventh studio album, ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'', was released independently and is available free of charge on the band's website.Personal lifeIn contrast to his on stage personality, Reznor is often credited to be shy, soft spoken and a bit of a recluse. During the five years between his albums The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999), Trent Reznor struggled with depression, social anxiety disorder, and the death of his grandmother (who raised him). To deal with these issues, Reznor abused alcohol and other drugs. He eventually developed alcoholism and a cocaine addiction; however, he was not using heroin, as had been widely rumored.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Reznor successfully completed rehab in New Orleans, and eventually moved to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', Reznor makes a note of his self-destructive past: &quot;There was a persona that had run its course. I needed to get my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I took a couple of years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since recovering from his addictions, Reznor admitted in a 2005 interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' that &quot;I’m pretty happy right now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;In the late 1990s Reznor was involved in a feud with Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, calling Durst a "moron" and saying in a 1999 interview in Rolling Stone, "Fred Durst can surf a piece of plywood up my ass".&lt;/ref&gt; However, Reznor is credited as a writer of the song &quot;Hot Dog&quot; on Limp Bizkit's album ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'', due to this song's use of lyrics from a number of Nine Inch Nails songs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Reznor is a fan of David Bowie, and has cited Bowie's 1977 album Low as one of his favorite albums. Reznor has stated that he played the album constantly during the recording of The Downward Spiral for inspiration.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie toured as a co-headlining act on the Outside Tour, and also appears in Bowie's video for &quot;[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]&quot; as Bowie's [[stalking|stalker]].  Reznor also made several remixes for the single release of the same song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afraid of Americans&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Allegedly, Reznor had a relationship with Tori Amos in 1994 when The Downward Spiral was being made. However, they have both said that they were just friends. It is also thought that Reznor had a short relationship with Courtney Love, also in 1994. Reznor denies this while Love has talked openly about their apparent 'fling'.Reznor has also worked to further animal welfare. He narrated a video for PETA, describing the cat and dog fur trade in China and urging viewers to avoid fur clothing.&lt;/ref&gt;Work outside of Nine Inch NailsReznor was the credited producer for Marilyn Manson's albums Portrait of an American Family (1994), Smells Like Children (1995), and Antichrist Superstar (1996), as well as the soundtrack for the films Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway.

In 1998 Reznor produced a remix of Notorious B.I.G.'s song "Victory" which also featured Busta Rhymes.The original music from id Software's video game Quake is credited to "Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails";&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor helped record sound effects and ambient audio, and the NIN logo appears on ammunition boxes in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired Quake&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Reznor's association with id Software began with Reznor being a fan of the original Doom. He reunited with id Software in 2003 as the sound engineer for Doom 3, though due to "time, money and bad management",&lt;/ref&gt; he had to abandon the project, and his audio work did not make it into the game's final release.Under the band name Tapeworm, Reznor collaborated over the span of nearly 10 years with Danny Lohner, Maynard James Keenan, and Atticus Ross, but the project was eventually terminated before any official material was released.&lt;/ref&gt; The only known released Tapeworm material was a reworked version of a track called &quot;Vacant,&quot; retitled &quot;[[Passive (song)|Passive]],&quot; on [[A Perfect Circle]]'s 2004 album ''[[eMOTIVe]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vacant/Passive&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;In 2006, Reznor played his first "solo" show(s) at Neil Young's annual Bridge School Benefit.
