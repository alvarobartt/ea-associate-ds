In geometry, a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two sets of parallel sides. The opposite sides of a parallelogram are of equal length, and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are congruent. The three-dimensional counterpart of a parallelogram is a parallelepiped.PropertiesThe area, A, of a parallelogram is A = BH, where B is the base of the parallelogram and H is its height.The area of a parallelogram is twice the area of a triangle created by one of its diagonals.The area of a parallelogram is also equal to the magnitude of the vector cross product of two adjacent sides.The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.Each diagonal bisects the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.It is possible to create a tessellation of a plane with any parallelogram.The properties of having equal opposite sides and opposite angles are shared with the antiparallelogram, a type of non-convex quadrilateral in which the two longer edges cross each other.Computing the area of a parallelogramLet a,b\in\R^2 and let V=b\in\R^ denote the matrix with columns a and b. Then the area of the parallelogram generated by a and b is equal to |\det(V)|Let a,b\in\R^n and let V=b\in\R^. Then the area of the parallelogram generated by a and b is equal to \sqrtLet a,b,c\in\R^2. Then the area of the parallelogram is equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix built using a, b and c as rows with the last column padded using ones as follows: V = \left| \det \begin       a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; 1 \\
       b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; 1 \\
       c_1 &amp; c_2 &amp; 1
\end \right|. &lt;/math&gt;Proof that diagonals bisect each otherTo prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, first note a few pairs of equivalent angles:\angle ABE \cong \angle CDE\angle BAE \cong \angle DCESince they are angles that a transversal makes with parallel lines AB and DC.Also, \angle AEB \cong \angle CED since they are a pair of vertical angles.Therefore, \triangle ABE \sim \triangle CDE since they have the same angles.From this similarity, we have the ratios =  = Since AB = DC, we have = 1.Therefore,AE = CEBE = DEE bisects the diagonals AC and BD.You can also prove that the diagonals bisect each other, by placing the parallelogram on a coordinate grid, and assign variables to the vertexes, you can show that the diagonals have the same midpoint.Derivation of the area formulaThe area formula,A_\text = B \times H,\,can be derived as follows:The area of the parallelogram to the right (the blue area) is the total area of the rectangle less the area of the two orange triangles. The area of the rectangle isA_\text = (B+A) \times H\,and the area of a single orange triangle isA_\text = \frac A \times H\, or S_\text = \frac bh,Therefore, the area of the parallelogram isA_\text =A_\text - 2 \times A_\text = \left( (B+A) \times H \right) - \left( A \times H \right) = B \times H.\, Alternate methodAn alternative, less mathematically sophisticated method, to show the area is by rearrangement of the perimeter. First, take the two ends of the parallelogram and chop them off to form two more triangles. Each of these two new triangles are equal in every way with the orange triangles. This first step is shown to the right.The second step is merely swap the left orange triangle with the right blue triangle. Clearly, the two blue triangles plus the blue rectangle have an area equivalent to B H.To further demonstrate this, the first image on the right could be printed off and cut up along the lines:Cut along the lines between the orange triangles and the blue parallelogramCut along the vertical lines on the end to form the two blue triangles and the blue rectangleRearrange all five pieces as shown in the second imageSee alsoFundamental parallelogramParallelogram of forceRhombusSynthetic geometryGnomon (figure)External linksParallelogram and Rhombus - Animated course (Construction, Circumference, Area)Interactive Parallelogram --sides, angles and slopeArea of Parallelogram at cut-the-knotEquilateral Triangles On Sides of a Parallelogram at cut-the-knotVarignon and Wittenbauer Parallelograms by Antonio Gutierrez from "Geometry Step by Step from the Land of the Incas"Van Aubel's theorem Quadrilateral with four squares by Antonio Gutierrez from "Geometry Step by Step from the Land of the Incas"Parallelogram QuizDefinition and properties of a parallelogram with animated appletInteractive applet showing parallelogram area calculation interactive appletCategory:Quadrilateralsar:متوازي أضلاع ast:Paralelogramu az:Paraleloqram be:Паралелаграм be-x-old:Паралеляграм bs:Paralelogram bg:Успоредник ca:Paral·lelogram cs:Rovnoběžník da:Parallelogram de:Parallelogramm el:Παραλληλόγραμμο es:Paralelogramo eo:Paralelogramo fr:Parallélogramme ko:평행사변형 hr:Paralelogram id:Jajar Genjang it:Parallelogramma he:מקבילית ka:პარალელოგრამი la:Parallelogramma lv:Paralelograms lt:Lygiagretainis hu:Paralelogramma mr:समांतरभुज चौकोन nl:Parallellogram ja:平行四辺形 no:Parallellogram nn:Parallellogram km:ប្រលេឡូក្រាម pl:Równoległobok pt:Paralelogramo ro:Paralelogram ru:Параллелограмм sl:Paralelogram sr:Паралелограм fi:Suunnikas sv:Parallellogram ta:இணைகரம் th:รูปสี่เหลี่ยมด้านขนาน vi:Hình bình hành uk:Паралелограм vls:Parallellogram zh:平行四边形
