He is the captain of the Romanian national team and currently plays with Internazionale.On 25 March, 2008 he was decorated by the president of România, Traian Băsescu for the results on Qualifying to EURO 2008 and qualification to UEFA Euro 2008 Group C with Medalia "Meritul Sportiv" — (The Medal "The Sportive Merit") class III.Club careerChivu's first professional club was CSM Reşiţa. After moving to Universitatea Craiova, his reputation began to rise and his performances sparked interest from some larger clubs outside of Romania. Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam was particularly impressed and recruited him in 1999.At Ajax he developed a reputation as a reliable fullback. Then-manager Ronald Koeman appointed him as captain of the club. With Chivu as captain, Ajax dominated the Dutch Eredivisie with an exciting young squad. Playing alongside Chivu were future stars such as Rafael van der Vaart, Zlatan Ibrahimović, and Andy van der Meyde. Chivu played a pivotal role for Ajax in their Champions League run in the 2002/03 season, when they came to within a minute of the semi-finals.Roma first expressed their interest in Chivu in 2003. At the time, Roma had an enormous debt and there were questions raised over Roma's ability to pay any proposed fee. Seeking to silence the increasing doubt over their financial situation, Roma sought a bank guarantee, which was subsequently denied. However, after much speculation Roma finally completed the purchase of Chivu, ending the long and protracted saga. The fee has been reported at €18m.After almost two months of speculations, Chivu signed a 5-year contract with Inter Milan on July 27 2007. The transfer fee is estimated to be €16 million. As part of the deal, defender Marco Andreolli moved to A.S. Roma in a co-ownership deal.Chivu's skill from set-pieces has added another dimension to his already well-rounded game. He has scored a number of free-kicks for both Ajax and Roma and with his deft left-foot shots as he continues to enhance his reputation as one of the finest defenders in Italy.International careerIn 1999, Chivu was chosen to represent the Romanian Under-20 team.Chivu has played for Romania more than 50 times, and he is currently captain of his country. He played for Romania in Euro 2000 and Euro 2008.Personal lifeChivu can speak Italian, Dutch and English as well as his native Romanian. He is currently in a relationship with Adelina Elisei (partner). According to the Calcio Italia magazine, Chivu has been involved in opening football schools around Romania for the past few years, as he says "I hope that he is proud when he looks down on me" in reference to his father who was a youth coach.Manager of the Romanian national football team, Victor Piturca, recently declared in a talk show that Chivu and his friend, goalkeeper Bogdan Lobont, are smokers despite the fact that they are professional football players.Honours'''With Inter Milan:Italian Serie A: 2007-08'''With AS Roma:Coppa Italia: 2006-2007'''With Ajax Amsterdam:Eredivisie champions: 2001-02KNVB Cup: 2001-02Johan Cruijff-schaal: 2002Personal awards:Dutch Footballer of the Year: 2002Romanian Footballer of the Year: 2002UEFA Team of the Year: 2002Marco van Basten Trofee : 1999/2000Club statisticsurl=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/stats?id=11000&amp;cc=5739 | title=Cristian Chivu | last= |first= | work=ESPN | date=2007-05-07 | accessdate=2007-07-14ClubSeasonDomestic LeagueDomestic CupsCounts for appearances and goals during the KNVB CupContinental gamesCounts for appearances and goals at the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and UEFA Intertoto Cup.TotalAppGoalsAppGoalsAppGoalsAppGoalsInternazionale Milano07-082602060340Total2602060340AS Roma06-07260708041005-06272704038204-05102401015203-042222040282Total8562001701226Ajax02-03266--12038601-02321--6038100-01265--4030599-00231--40271Total10713--26013313Universitatea Craiova99-006000000098-992630000263Total323--00323CSM Resita97-98232000023296-9710000010Total242--00242Career Totals2742422049034524Last updated May 26, 2008ReferencesExternal linksCristian Chivu's official websiteInter.it profileFootballDatabase provides Cristian Chivu's profile and statsGoal.com profile      Gheorghe Hagi| title=Romanian Footballer of the Year| years=2000| after= Cosmin Contra     Cosmin Contra| title=Romanian Footballer of the Year| years=2002| after= Adrian Mutu     [[Johann Vogel]]|
