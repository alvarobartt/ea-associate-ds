It belongs to a group of more terrestrial species, often called chats.It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in forest and scrub in Europe and south-west Asia. The distribution is more southerly than the very closely related Thrush Nightingale Luscinia luscinia. It nests on the ground within or next to dense bushes. It winters in southern Africa. At least in the Rhineland (Germany), the breeding habitat of nightingales agrees with a number of geographical parameters.

It is plain brown above except for the reddish tail. It is buff to white below. Sexes are similar.Nightingales are named so because they frequently sing at night as well as during the day. The name has been used for well over 1,000 years, being highly recognizable even in its Anglo-Saxon form - 'nihtingale'. It means 'night songstress'. Early writers assumed the female sang; in fact, it is the male. The male nightingale is known for his singing, to the extent that human singers are sometimes admiringly referred to as nightingales; the song is loud, with an impressive range of whistles, trills and gurgles. Its song is particularly noticeable at night because few other birds are singing. This is why its name (in several languages) includes "night". Only unpaired males sing regularly at night, and nocturnal song is likely to serve attracting a mate. Singing at dawn, during the hour before sunrise, is assumed to be important in defending the bird's territory. Nightingales sing even more loudly in urban or near-urban environments, in order to overcome the background noise. The most characteristic feature of the song is a loud whistling crescendo, absent from the song of Thrush Nightingale. It has a frog-like alarm call.The eastern subspecies L. m. hafizi and L. m. africana have paler upperparts and a stronger face-pattern, including a pale supercilium.CultureJohn Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale" has attracted high praise, the upper limit of which may be "one of our shorter English lyrics that still seems to me... the nearest to perfection, the one I would surrender last of all"&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages".. Reprinted from the Encyclopædia Britannica.The love of the nightingale for the rose is also widely used, often metaphorically, in Turkish literature (especially in poems of the Ottoman period) as well as in Persian literature.A Provençal folk song, "The Nightingale Which Flies", inspired Tchaikovsky when composing his Humoresque opus 10-2.ReferencesExternal linksInternet Bird Collection: Nightingale videos.
