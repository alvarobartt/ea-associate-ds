It is in the north-central part of the Mexican republic, It borders Coahuila to the north, Nuevo Leon to the north-east, Tamaulipas to the east, Veracruz to the east, Hidalgo, Queretaro, and Guanajuato to the south,and Zacatecas to the north-west. At the 2005 census the population was 2,410,414. The largest University in the State is the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí (UASLP).The native peoples of the state include the Huastecs and Pame people.In addition to the state capital San Luis Potosí, the state's largest cities include Ciudad Valles, Matehuala, and Rioverde.The state is at the center of an international ecological scandal, facing the illegal operation of Minera San Xavier, a subsidiary of Metallica Resources at the town of its foundation, Cerro de San Pedro, just 20 kilometers away from the capital of the state , with a known poisonous technique banned in first world countries, open pit mining leaching by cyanide.GeographySan Luis Potosí is bounded on the east by Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas and Veracruz, on the south by Hidalgo, Querétaro and Guanajuato, and on the west by Zacatecas.The state lies mostly on the Mexican Plateau, with the exception of the southeastern corner of the state, where the tableland breaks down into the tropical valley of the Panuco River. The surface of the plateau is comparatively level, with some low mountainous wooded ridges. The Sierra Madre Oriental runs north and south through the state, and separates the Mexican Plateau from the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. The Sierra Madre Oriental is home to the Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests. The Panuco River originates on the Plateau, and flows eastward through a gap in the Sierra Madre to drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The easternmost portion of the state lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain, and covered by the Veracruz moist forests.The Panuco and its tributaries drain the southern and southeastern portion of the state. The northern and central portion of the state, including the capital, lie on an interior drainage basin which does not drain to the sea.The mean elevation is about 6,000 ft., ensuring a temperate climate. The state lies partly within the arid zone of the north, while the southern half receiving a more liberal rainfall through the influence of the nortes, which deliver significant amounts of rain. The rainfall, however, is uncertain at the western and northern regions, and much of the state is poorly provided with rivers. The soil is fertile and in favorable seasons large crops of wheat, maize, beans and cotton are grown on the uplands. In the low tropical valleys, sugar, coffee, tobacco, peppers and fruit are staple products. Stockraising is an important industry and hides, tallow and wool are exported. Fine cabinet and construction woods are also exported to a limited extent.At one time San Luis Potosi ranked among the leading mining provinces of Mexico, but the revolts following independence resulted in a great decline in that industry. The area around Real de Catorce has some of the richest silver mines in the country. Other well-known silver mining districts are Peñón Blanco, Ramos and Guadalcázar. The development of Guadalcazar dates from 1620 and its ores yield gold, copper, zinc and bismuth, as well as silver. In the Ramos district, the Cocinera lode was said to have a total yield of over $60,000,000 in the first decade of the 20th century.Municipalities The State of San Luis Potosí is divided into 58 municipalities (Spanish: municipios), each headed by a municipal president (mayor).Major communitiesCiudad VallesMatehualaRioverdeSan Luis PotosíSoledad de Graciano SánchezVilla de ReyesEscalerillasRequetemuGovernors The current governor is Marcelo de los Santos Fraga (2003-2009) of the PAN party (Partido Accion Nacional).IndustryGeneral Motors now has a plant under construction, San Luis Potosí Assembly, to employ up to 1800 and assembly up to 160,000 vehicles per year.Famous PeopleArts and SciencesJulian Carillo Trujillo - Discovered The Thirteenth Sound, Born In Ahualulco, San Luis Potosi.Jesús Silva Herzog - Economist and member of the National College of Mexico, father of Jesús Silva Herzog FloresFrancisco González Bocanegra - Author of the Mexican National AnthemManuel Jose Othón - PoetEdward JamesJorge Carrillo m.d.JournalistsJulio Hernández López - Columnist of La JornadaJesús Blancornelas - Founder of ZetaPoliticsPonciano ArriagaMiguel Barragán - President of MexicoCarlos Jongitud BarriosGonzalo Martínez Corbala - Ambassador to Chile during the CoupLuis Ernesto DerbezAlfonso Lastras RamirezSalvador Nava MartínezFrancisco Xavier Salazar SaenzAntonio Rocha CorderoGonzalo N.
