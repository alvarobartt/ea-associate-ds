The Arecibo message was beamed via frequency modulated radio waves into space at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope on 16 November 1974. It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13 some 25,000 light years away because M13 was a large and close collection of stars that was available in the sky at the time and place of the ceremony. The message consisted of 1679 binary digits, approximately 210 bytes, transmitted at a frequency of 2380&nbsp;MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10&nbsp;Hz, with a power of 1000kW. The cardinality was chosen because it is a semiprime (the product of two prime numbers), to be arranged rectangularly as 73 rows by 23 columns. The alternate arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, produces jumbled nonsense. The message forms the image shown on the right, or its inverse, when translated into graphics characters and spaces. The entire transmission lasted 1679 seconds and was not repeated.Dr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others. The message consists of 7 parts that encode the following:the numbers one (1) through ten (10)the atomic numbers of the elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, which make up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)the formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNAthe number of nucleotides in DNA, and a graphic of the double helix structure of DNAa graphic figure of a man, the dimension (physical height) of an average man, and the human population of Eartha graphic of Earth's solar systema graphic of the Arecibo radio telescope and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dishBecause it will take 25,000 years for the message to reach its intended destination of stars (and an additional 25,000 years for any reply), the Arecibo message was more a demonstration of human technological achievement than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials. In fact, the stars that the message was aimed at will no longer be there when it arrives. According to the Cornell News press release of Nov. 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact, but to demonstrate the capabilities of newly installed equipment.ExplanationNumbers1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10

X X X X X X X X  X  X &lt;-least-significant-digit markerThe numbers from 1 to 10 appear in binary format (the bottom row marks the beginning of each number).Even knowing binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious due to the way they have been written. To read the first seven digits, ignore the bottom row, and read them as three binary digits from top to bottom, with the top digit being the most significant.The readings for 8, 9 and 10 are a little different, as they have been given an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image). This is probably intended to show that numbers too large to fit in a column can be written in several contiguous ones, where the contiguous columns do not have the base marker.DNA elementsH C N O P

These are the atomic numbers of hydrogen (H), carbon ©, nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and phosphorus (P), the components of DNA.The numbers 8 and 15 are written in a logical extension of binary encoding, rather than with the contiguous-columns method shown in the message's number figures at the top:Nucleotides[[Deoxyribose]] [[Adenine]] [[Thymine]] Deoxyribose

This corresponds to the horizontally written binary 14 multiplied by the wavelength of the message (126&nbsp;mm). The element on the right depicts the size of human population in 1974, around 4.3 billion. In this case, the number is oriented horizontally rather than vertically, with the least-significant-digit marker to the upper left in the image.Planets               Earth
