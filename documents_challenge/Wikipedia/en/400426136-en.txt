However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient and medieval India, most notably of the Mughal Empire which was part of Punjab Region from 1799 to 1849. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the Indian Empire from Calcutta to Delhi. Unlike Calcutta, which was located on the eastern coast of India, Delhi was located in northern India and the Government of British India felt that it would be easier to administer India from Delhi rather than from Calcutta. George V, the then Emperor of India, made the announcement the capital of the Raj was to be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.New Delhi was laid out to the south of the Old City which was constructed by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.
