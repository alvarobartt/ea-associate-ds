In Prague in 1981, he beat Italian Giuseppe Saronni and France's Bernard Hinault. He was also second in the 1973 world championship.Maertens also won the 1977 Vuelta a España, taking more than half the stages; 13 in total, and took the spinters' maillot vert in the Tour de France three times (1976 Tour de France, 1978 Tour de France and 1981 Tour de France). In 1976 he won a record-equalling eight stages of the Tour de France; the following year (1977), he took seven stages in the Giro d'Italia.Outside the Grand Tours, his stage race victories included Paris-Nice (1977), the Quatre Jours de Dunkerque (1973, 1975, 1976 and 1978), the Tour of Andalucia (1974, 1975), Tour of Belgium (1974, 1975), Tour de Luxembourg (1975), Tour of Sardinia (1977) and Vuelta y Catalunya (1977).However, despite his sprinting dominance during the 1970s, Maertens did not win a one-day Classic, coming closest with second places in the Ronde van Vlaanderen (1973) and Liège-Bastogne-Liège (1976). He was disqualified from second place in the 1977 Ronde for an illegal bike change on the Koppenberg climb. His other major one-day road race victories included:Gent-Wevelgem (1975, 1976)Paris-Brussels (1975)Paris-Tours (1975)Amstel Gold Race (1976)Rund um den Henninger Turm (1976)Züri-Metzgete (1976)Omloop &quot;Het Volk&quot; (1977, 1978)Grote Scheldeprijs (1973)Maertens is believed to have been one of the best sprinters in the world, and is credited with having nurtured another great sprinter Seán Kelly during the latter's early professional career. He was also an accomplished rider in individual time trials, winning the Grand Prix des Nations in 1976.He also won the season-long Super Prestige Pernod International competition in 1976 and 1977.Maertens was known to have pushed high gears, which some critics say caused him to burn out early and retire at young. In response, he said that the higher gears allow him to descend without too much strain to his heart.A year after his fabulous 1981 season his career was all but on the rocks & as reigning World Champion he failed to start the 1982 edition of the race at Goodwood , the official line was that he injured his knee on a gate.In the 1973 world championship in Barcelona, Spain, fellow Belgian Eddy Merckx accused Maertens of having chased him in the final lap while Merckx had a good chance of staying away, resulting in Italy's Felice Gimondi winning the title. Maertens responded that Merckx had sabotaged his ride because Maertens was riding Shimano components while the other two used Campagnolo. In recent interviews Maertens and Merckx said they have since reconciled their differences.After retirement Maertens and his wife Carine had many hard years after losing much of their money and being pursued by tax authorities. Maertens was also angry when Belgian television used his photograph as a backdrop to discussions about drug-taking in the sport. He told the French newspaper L'Équipe that "like everyone else", he had used amphetamines in round-the-houses races but he insisted that he had ridden without drugs in important races - not least because he knew he would be tested for them. He previously worked as curator of the Belgian national cycling museum in Roeselare, and now works at the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders Museum), in Oudenaarde.The bicycle shop Maertens Sport in Evergem on the outskirts of Gent is owned by Freddy's brother Mario.Palmarès1971 National Amateur Road Race Championship, World Amateur Road Race Championship19731st, Overall, Quatre Jours de DunkerqueWinner Stage 5b1st, Scheldeprijs, World Road Race Championship2nd, Ronde van Vlaanderen5th, Paris-Roubaix19741st, Overall, Tour de LuxembourgWinner Stages 1 & 21st, Overall, Vuelta a AndalucíaWinner Prologue a-b, stages 1, 2, 4, 5 & 61st, Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen1st, Stages 2, 3 & 4, Ronde van België1st, Stage 3b, Quatre Jours de Dunkerque4th, Amstel Gold Race5th, Paris-Tours19751st, Paris-Tours1st, Paris-Brussels1st, Gent-Wevelgem1st, Overall, Ronde van BelgiëWinner Stages 1b & 21st, Overall, Vuelta a AndalucíaWinner Prologue, stages 5, 6 & 7b1st, Overall, Quatre Jours de DunkerqueWinner Stage 3b1st, Prologue, stages 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4 & 7b, Dauphiné Libéré2nd, Amstel Gold Race3rd, National Madison Championship (with Walter Godefroot)4th, Flèche Wallonne5th, Giro di Lombardia5th, Overall, Paris-NiceWinner Stage 21976 World Road Race Championship National Road Race Championship, Dilsen1st, Amstel Gold Race1st, Rund um den Henninger-Turm1st, Züri-Metzgete1st, Gent-Wevelgem1st, Grand Prix des Nations1st, Overall, Quatre Jours de DunkerqueWinner Stage 2b1st, Brabantse Pijl1st, Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen1st, Trofeo Baracchi (with Michel Pollentier)1st, Critérium des As1st, Six Days of Dortmund (with Patrick Sercu)2nd, Liège-Bastogne-Liège3rd, Flèche Wallonne3rd, National Madison Championship (with Marc Demeyer)4th, Overall, Paris-NiceWinner Prologue, stages 2, 3, 4, 6a & 6b5th, Ronde van Vlaanderen7th, Overall, Tour de SuisseWinner Prologue, stage 1 & Points Classification8th, Overall, Tour de France:Winner Prologue, stages 1, 3, 7, 18a, 18b, 21 & 22aWinner Points ClassificationWinner Super Prestige Pernod1977 National Derny Championship1st, Omloop Het Volk1st, Overall, Vuelta a España:Winner overall classificationWinner Prologue, stages 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11a, 11b, 13, 16 & 19Winner Points Classification1st, Overall, Paris-NiceWinner Stages 1a, 1b, 2 & 7b1st, Overall, Setmana Catalana de CiclismeWinner Stages 1, 4, 5a & 5b1st, Trofeo Laigueglia1st, Overall, Giro di SardegnaWinner Stage 11st, Overall, Volta Ciclista a CatalunyaWinner Prologue, stages 1, 3, 4 & 7a1st, Stage 1, Tour de Suisse1st, Six Days of Antwerp (with Patrick Sercu)2nd, National Omnium Championship3rd, Paris-Roubaix, European Omnium Championship5th, Milano-San Remo5th, Liège-Bastogne-Liège5th, Amstel Gold RaceGiro d'Italia:Winner Prologue, stages 1, 4, 6a, 6b, 7 & 8aWinner Super Prestige Pernod19781st, Omloop Het Volk1st, Overall, Quatre Jours de DunkerqueWinner Stages 2a & 2b1st, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen1st, Tour du Haut Var1st, Stage 7a, Dauphiné Libéré1st, Six Days of Antwerp (with Danny Clark), European Omnium Championship4th, Paris-Roubaix4th, Amstel Gold Race13th, Overall, Tour de France:Winner Stages 5 & 7Winner Points Classification14th, Overall, Tour de SuisseWinner Stage 51981 World Road Race Championship66th, Overall, Tour de France:Winner Stages 1a, 3, 12a, 13, & 22Winner points classificationWinner Intermediate Sprints ClassificationSee alsoList of doping cases in cyclingExternal linksOfficial Tour de France results for Freddy MaertensFurther reading"Fall From Grace" by Freddy Maertens and Manu Adriaens, ISBN 1-898111-00-6, 1993, Ronde Publications, Hull.
