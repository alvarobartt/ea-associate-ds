Audio Bullys are an electronic music group from the United Kingdom, consisting of Simon Franks and Tom Dinsdale.The duo released their debut album Ego War in 2003 to positive reviews which helped to establish them as one of the best new acts in dance music. The album fused elements of breaks, hip-hop, punk, garage and house with clever beats and samples.In 2005 they released Generation, the follow-up to their debut album. Despite reaching number 3 in the UK Singles Chart with their 2005 hit, "Shot You Down", which samples the Nancy Sinatra version of the song "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)", the album was poorly received. Generation was seen as a step away from what made Ego War appealing due to the pace being slower and a number of tracks being downbeat in mood. In a 2008 interview, Simon Franks suggested that they listened to their label, Virgin, too much: "We should never have listened to anyone else". "Virgin admitted they didn't know how to market house music, and it slowly turned into us making this slower album. The daft thing is, Shot You Down was the big hit, this old-school club track, but it was followed by a moody, dark record. It confused everyone."In making Generation, the group worked with Suggs of Madness collaborating on the track "This Road".Their new album, 'Sunday Night Fever', is due out in September 2008.DiscographyAlbumsHooligan House (2003)Ego War (2003) #19 UKGeneration (2005) #33 UKSunday Night Fever (2008)SinglesFrom Ego War:"We Don't Care" (2003) #15 UK"The Things"/"Turned Away" (2003) #22 UK"Way Too Long" (2003)Compilations/Mixed CDs"Hooligan House: The Sound of 2003" (2002) (Muzik Magazine Mix CD)"Back to Mine" (2004)Guest appearance:"Break Down The Doors" (Morillo featuring Audio Bullys) (2004) #44 UKFrom Generation:"Shot You Down" (featuring Nancy Sinatra) (2005) #3 UK. # 18 AUS"I'm In Love" (2005) #27 UK"All Sing Along" (featured in Microsoft Zune ad)Non-album single"Drop It" (2006) #200 UK"Flickery Vision EP" (2007)"Let The Beats Roll (featuring Tim Deluxe)"Gimme That Punk (2008)RemixesThe Prodigy - "Out of Space"Armand van Helden Ft.
