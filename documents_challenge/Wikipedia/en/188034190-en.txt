Analcime or analcite (from the Greek analkimos - "weak") is a white, grey, or colourless tectosilicate mineral. Analcime consists of hydrated sodium aluminium silicate in cubic crystalline form. Its chemical formula is NaAlSi2O6·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Minor amounts of potassium and calcium substitute for sodium. A silver bearing synthetic variety also exists (Ag-analcite).Analcime is usually classified as a zeolite mineral, but structurally and chemically it is more similar to the feldspathoids. Analcime occurs as a primary mineral in analcime basalt and other alkaline igneous rocks. It also occurs as cavity and vesicle fillings associated with prehnite, calcite, and zeolites. , US]]Locations include the Cyclopean Islands east off Sicily and near Trentino in northern Italy; Victoria in Australia; Kerguelen Island in the Indian Ocean; in the Lake Superior copper district of Michigan, Bergen Hill, New Jersey, Golden, Colorado in the United States; and at Cape Blomidon, Nova Scotia and Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec in Canada; and in Iceland.See alsoList of mineralsReferencesHurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy, 20th ed., ISBN 0-471-80580-7Mineral GalleriesMindat.orgWebmineral.comCategory:Zeolites Category:Sodium minerals Category:Aluminium mineralsde:Analcim es:Analcima eu:Analzima fr:Analcime it:Analcime he:אנלציט lb:Analcim hu:Analcim nl:Analciem pl:Analcym sk:Analcím fi:Analsiimi sv:Analcim uk:Анальцим
