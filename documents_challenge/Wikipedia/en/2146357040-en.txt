It has a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout, an all-aluminium body and chassis, and a V6 gasoline engine featuring Honda's VTEC system.DevelopmentIn 1984 Honda commissioned Pininfarina to design the HP-X ('H'onda 'P'ininfarina 'X'perimental),&lt;/ref&gt; which had a mid-mounted 2.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 configuration.The production NSX was designed by a team led by Chief Designer Ken Okuyama and Executive Chief Engineer Shigeru Uehara, who was also in charge of the S2000 project. Its first public appearances as the NS-X were at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1989, and at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1989.Honda Worldwide | July 12, 2005 &quot;Honda to Discontinue Production of the NSX Sports Car&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Japanese Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima was involved with the NSX's development, performing many duties related to chassis tuning. Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna and American Bobby Rahal also participated in the car's development.St. Antoine, Arthur. "The Asphalt Jungle: Ayrton's Car." Motor Trend. Senna was given a NSX by Honda, although details of this car and its fate are unclear. Honda's breakthrough engineering in the NSX was a major contributor to the design of the McLaren F1 as mentioned in an interview with McLaren designer Gordon Murray. Honda - The Power of Dreams. "The moment I drove the NSX, all the benchmark cars--Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini--I had been using as references in the development of my car vanished from my mind. Of course the car we would create, the McLaren F1, needed to be faster than the NSX, but the NSX's ride quality and handling would become our new design target." The NSX was also the world's first all-aluminum and aluminum monocoque chassis production car, and was also marketed as the "Everyday Supercar" thanks in part to its ease of use, quality and reliability, traits that were unheard of in the supercar segment at the time.Manufacture and releaseUpon its release in 1990, the NSX was a design ahead of its time, at only  in height only  taller than the legendary Ford GT40. The car showcased Honda's racing technology, exemplified by the NSX's ultra-rigid, ultra-light aluminium monocoque chassis, aluminium suspension, titanium connecting rods, forged pistons and high-revving capabilities — the redline was at a lofty 8,000 rpm. Today it is still known by many as the most reliable exotic car with many examples exceeding 100,000 miles without any reliability issues. The car's strong chassis rigidity and cornering/handling capabilities were the results of Ayrton Senna's direct input with NSX's chief engineers while testing at the Honda owned Suzuka Circuit during its final development stages. The NSX was initially assembled at the purpose-built Takanezawa R&D Plant in Tochigi from 1989 to early 2004, when it was moved to Suzuka Plant for the remainder of its production life. The cars were assembled by approximately 200 experienced, hand-picked staff from various Honda factories. Honda designed the NSX in search of the perfect balance between power and reliability and thus produced a powerful naturally aspirated engine suitable for the abuse of road racing.One of the first magazine articles show the lightweight 3.0L 270 HP NSX producing a best 0-60 mp/h time of 5.03 seconds and 13.47 seconds for the quarter mile."Sports Car International - December 1990." NSX Prime, 1997-2005.Also on a Ferrari 348 to NSX comparison, a 0-60 time of 5.2 seconds was recorded for the 1991 NSX."Sports Car International - August 1990" NSX Prime, 1997-2005. This Ferrari level performance made the NSX known as the "First Japanese Exotic Super car".Wheels magazine Australia awarded the Honda NSX the 1991 Car of the Year award.Despite the current age of the NSX, it still has a strong base of fans and supporters. Honda and many NSX enthusiasts describe the vehicle as a supercar based on its body type, drivetrain layout, low seating position, packaging, and especially car handling. Others disagree, claiming the NSX does not qualify for exotic car/supercar status because the car's power rating is not as high as modern supercars, although its rated 270 horsepower (200 kW) at debut in 1990 was only 30 horsepower (22 kW) shy of the  heavier Ferrari 348, the NSX's direct rival. Because of its lighter weight, the NSX was slightly faster than the 348 in straight-line acceleration. At one time, it featured the highest per-litre specific output of any road-going naturally aspirated V6 engine in the world, and even now it is exceptionally fast for the motor's relatively low power output versus comparable "supercars." Post-1997 3.2&nbsp;L North American Acura examples are known to achieve a 13.3 second quarter-mile time "Sports Car International - December 1998." NSX Prime, 1997-2005. (1997-2005 model year NSX-T; the  lighter Zanardi Edition NSX is closer to 13.2 seconds "Acura NSX Zanardi Edition." Car & Driver, July 1999.), while the Japanese NSX-R (2002+) is known to perform a 12.9 second quarter-mile time. This ability is a result of the high 8,000 rpm redline, flat power curve, short gear ratios, light weight and mid-engine layout, along with the light power increase.On July 20, 2005, days after the announcement of the closure of current NSX production, Honda CEO Takeo Fukui announced that a new NSX was under development and would sport a Formula One-inspired V10 motor, with speculation that it might have the SH-AWD (Super Handling All Wheel Drive) system introduced on the Acura RL. In addition, he stated it would be ready within three to four years. The last US production model NSX was sold in the summer of 2006 in Spokane, Washington. It was originally supposed to be put in Honda's museum, but was not. Jay Leno also showed interest in the car, but backed down so it was shipped to Spokane and sold.First generation NSX-R ([[Japanese Domestic Market]])Beginning in 1992 Honda produced a limited number of 483 ''NSX-R''s exclusively for the Japanese domestic market (JDM). Major changes include a blueprinted engine producing  in stock form, a different final ratio for the gearbox, a more aggressive suspension and an extensive weight reduction to  from . The NSX-R was very track oriented as it lacked sound deadening, audio and air conditioning in an effort to reduce weight. However, these items were available for a hefty premium as optional items. Production ended in 1995.NSX-TIn 1995 the NSX-T with a targa top roof was released in Japan as a special order option. In North America, the NSX-T replaced the standard coupe entirely as the only trim available, with the notable exceptions of the Zanardi Edition NSX in 1999 and a handful of special ordered post-1997/pre-2002 3.2 liter coupes. The removable roof reduced the chassis rigidity of the NSX and added about 100 pounds (45 kg) of structural reinforcements. In addition to this major change, the suspensions have also been softened to improve ride, comfort, and tire wear, at the expense of ultimate handling. The suspension redesign was also intended to reduce the sudden-oversteer problems that plagued most mid-engined vehicles. All roofs were now body-colored instead of black, although in Japan the two-tone black roof/body color was still available as an optional feature. Finally available in the manual transmission version NSX was electric power steering, previously found in the automatic version exclusively.1997 performance-enhancing changes (Worldwide)1997 brought the biggest changes to the performance of the current generation NSX for the Japanese domestic versions and abroad. For 1997 engine displacement increased from 3.0&nbsp;L to 3.2&nbsp;L. This new 3.2&nbsp;L C32B engine gave it slightly more rated power: from  to  while torque increased from  to  (manual transmission only). The 4-speed automatic model still used the 3.0 litre engine and power output. Another big change was the adoption of the 6-speed manual transmission. The combination of slightly-increased power and torque, 6-speed manual gearbox, and optimized gear ratio produced improved straight-line acceleration. The new NSX rang up better numbers than the power and torque improvements may suggest over previous model NSXs. 0-60 mph time dropped from 5.4 seconds to as low as 5.0 seconds for the NSX-S Zero. Other notable changes include a brake rotor size increase from  to  — which necessitated larger wheels and tires, a new aluminium alloy to further reduce weight and increase rigidity, and a transponder in the key.NSX-S, S-Zero ([[Japanese Domestic Market]])Along with the engine enlargement in 1997, Japan exclusively received the NSX type S (NSX-S) and NSX type S Zero (NSX-S-Zero), weighing in at  and  respectively. Both had a stiffer suspension than the normal NSX.Unlike the standard Type S, the S-Zero does not offer Air Conditioning, navigation, and stereo system as an option. The suspension is stiffer than the standard Type S by using the NA1 Type R (1992 to 1995) suspension. The Best Motoring did a sub 12.4x second 1/4 mile, which is quite a remarkable achievement when compared to cars such as the Ferrari F355 and Porsche 996 Turbo. Changes were also made to the interior's manual transmission boot shifter, replacing the original material from leather to mesh to save approx .28 grams.Alex Zanardi Edition NSXProduced exclusively for the United States, the Alex Zanardi Edition NSX was introduced in 1999 to commemorate Alex Zanardi's two back-to-back CART Champ Car championship wins for Honda / Acura in 1997 and 1998. Only fifty-one examples were built, and they were available only in New Formula Red to reflect the colour of the Champ Car Zanardi drove for Chip Ganassi Racing.The Zanardi Edition was similar to the Japanese market NSX Type S. Visible differences between the Zanardi Edition and the Type S were the Zanardi's left-hand drive, black leather and suede seats with red stitching, airbag-equipped Acura steering wheel, and a brushed-aluminium plaque with an engraved Acura logo, Zanardi's signature, and a serial number on the rear bulkhead.Zanardi Number 0 was a press car that also appeared in auto shows across the country. In a handling test in Road and Track's June 1999 issue, this Zanardi NSX placed second against the Dodge Viper GTS-R, Lotus Esprit, Porsche 911 Carrera 4, Ferrari F355 Spyder, and Chevrolet Corvette C5 Coupe. The car was also featured in Car and Driver's July 1999 issue before being sold to a private individual. Zanardi Number 1 belongs to Zanardi himself and was not given a North American VIN. The car is rumored to have been modified by Honda with hand-activated throttle, braking, and shifting mechanisms to accommodate Zanardi's paraplegia resulting from his Lausitzring crash in 2001. Zanardi numbers 2 through 50 were sold to the general public through dealers.&quot;Facelifted&quot; NSX (Worldwide)The biggest exterior changes for the NSX came in 2002 when it received a facelift with fixed headlights and various other cosmetic refinements such as xenon HID headlamps (see photo from LA Autoshow 2003). The fixed roof NSX was dropped for the 2002 model year. The suspension was revised and the NSX received larger wheels and tires. In addition, the NSX was available in a number of exterior colors with either a matching or black interior to provide a number of possible color combinations.Second generation NSX-R ([[Japanese Domestic Market]])A second iteration of the Type-R dubbed NSX-R was released in 2002, again exclusively in Japan. The second generation NSX-R had a more aggressive rear spoiler and hood vent, along with larger yet lighter wheels to reduce weight to . The rear spoiler was said to be the largest one-piece carbon-fibre spoiler in production cars. Under the body, panels and air fences in the front along with a small rear diffuser serve to produce balanced "negative lift" or downforce.-Tire size comparison:First-Gen NSX-R: F205/50 R16, R225/50 R16 Second-Gen NSX-R: F215/40 R17, R255/40 R17-The subtle aerodynamic changes along with the larger tires made the second generation NSX-R easier to drive with less tendency to over-rotate ultimately making it faster around the race track.A more agile, more responsive, and quicker limited edition NSX called the NSX-R GT was later released. This model was limited to a production run of five cars. This NSX was created to help Honda comply with the Super GT production-based race car homologation requirements. It is easily identifiable by the non-functional snorkel attached to the roof of the car (the snorkel is fully functional in the Super GT race cars), lower and widened body, and more aggressive aerodynamic components.Second generation NSX-S (JDM)The second iteration NSX-S, sold exclusively in Japan, continues with the face-lifted NSX keeping the weight at .In motorsport]]Safety carSince the beginning of the NSX's production, the car has been used as a safety car at the Suzuka circuit, even for the Japanese Grand Prix in its early years of production, and is still used at the circuit. The car is also used for the same role at Twin Ring Motegi, the other circuit owned by Honda. 24 Hours of Le MansThe NSX made three appearances at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 1994, 1995 and 1996.Three Honda NSXs were entered in the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans. Cars numbers 46, 47 and 48 were prepared and run by team Kremer Racing Honda, with Team Kunimitsu assisting and driving the number 47 car. All were in the GT2 class, and all completed the race, but placed 14th, 16th and 18th. 24 Hours of LeMans, 1994.Three Honda NSXs were entered in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans. Honda's factory team brought two turbocharged NSXs which were entered in the GT1 class numbered 46 and 47. Car 46 finished but was not classified for failing to complete 70% of the distance of the race winner. Car 47 did not finish due to clutch and gearbox failure. The third NSX, number 84, was prepared as a naturally aspirated car and run by Team Kunimitsu Honda in the GT2 class. This NSX, driven by Keiichi Tsuchiya, Akira Iida, and Kunimitsu Takahashi, placed 8th overall and first in the GT2 class after completing 275 laps. This NSX was featured in the game Gran Turismo. 24 Hours of LeMans, 1995.For the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans, only the Team Kunimitsu Honda NSX returned with the same drivers. It completed 305 laps to finish in the 16th position overall, and third in the GT2 class. 24 Hours of LeMans, 1996. [[Image:RAYBRIG NSX GT500 2002.jpg|thumb|The 2002 SuperGT Raybrig NSX GT500]]Super GTFor use in the Super GT, formerly the All Japan GTC and JGTC, the NSX has been highly modified (as allowed by series technical regulations) with chassis development by Dome, engine development by Mugen, for Honda.Externally the NSX shape has developed race by race, season to season to the demands of increasing aerodynamic downforce within the regulations. The most notable change is the position of the V6 engine, which is mounted longitudinally instead of transversely as per the roadcar. Similar to the setup used in modern Lamborghinis, the gearbox is located in the center tunnel under the cockpit and is connected to the rear differential by a driveshaft. Engines can either be turbocharged or naturally aspirated, depending on the class and on the rules.The NSX continues to be used as the works Honda car in the GT500 class, even though it is no longer in production.ReferencesExternal linksHonda NSX official websiteHonda Japan NSX official websiteHonda Japan SUPER GT official websiteNsxPrime.com Largest US Owners Forum &amp; Technical Database NSX Category:Honda Verno Category:Sports cars Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive vehicles Category:1990s automobiles Category:2000s automobiles de:Honda NSX es:Honda NSX fr:Honda NSX io:Honda NSX it:Honda NSX nl:Honda NSX ja:ホンダ・NSX no:Honda NSX pl:Honda NSX pt:Honda NSX ru:Honda NSX zh:本田NSX
