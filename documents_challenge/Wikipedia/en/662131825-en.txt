Ouest-France Editions At the time of the birth of Madame de Sévigné, about 1620, the city counted 7,500 inhabitants. The population reached 14,000 inhabitants in 1762. This population was contained within the medieval boundaries of the city, which was a third the size of the modern Vitré. This made for a population density at the time of nearly 30,000 inhabitants per km².In 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, Vitré's population reached 10,850 inhabitants. In the post-revolution period there was a significant drop in population, to 8,904 inhabitants by 1861. In 1911 a moderate increase brought the figure to 10,613. The First World War and its subsequent economic trials would reduce the population to 8,506. By 1999 the population again had reached 18th century levels, with 15,313 inhabitants and 18,000 in 2006. The three cantons of Vitré (Vitré-west, Vitré-East and Argentré-du-Plessis) counted 44,623 inhabitants in 1999. The greater Vitré-Community counts 55,464 inhabitants, including the canton of Châteaubourg.Inhabitants of Vitré are called Vitréens.HistoryEarly settlementThe site of Vitré was occupied in Gallo-Roman times. The name Vitré comes from the Gallo-Roman name "Victor" or "Victrix", after the owner of a farm in the region. The year 1000 marked the formal birth of Vitré, when the duke of Brittany Geoffrey I bestowed feudal powers upon Riwallon Le Vicaire, who was charged with keeping this strategic area as a buffer zone of the "Marches of Brittany". A small wooden motte-and-bailey castle, on a feudal mound, was built on the Sainte-Croix hill. The castle was burned down on several occasions, and eventually was bequeathed to the Benedictine monks of Marmoutiers. A stone castle was built in 1070 by Robert Ier on the current site, on a rocky outcrop dominating the Vilaine's river valley. Certain parts of the original stone castle still are visible today.In the 13th century, the castle was enlarged and equipped with robust towers and curtain walls. The castle combined the triangular site of the outcropping on which it was built a structure in the style of the castles of Philippe Auguste. During this period the "Vieil Bourg," including the church of Notre-Dame, developed on the eastern side of Vitré. The city was encircled with fortified ramparts and ditches. It was at this time that the "walled city" took its current form. The Baron directed the construction of the "privileged boroughs" around the walled city. These boroughs defined the linear layout of the streets of Vitré's present neighborhoods. Since the 13th century, Vitré has joined together all of the elements of the traditional medieval city: a fortified castle, religious buildings, churches, colleges, and suburbs.Middle Ages  In the 15th century, the castle was modified to keep up with developments in artillery design. It was decommissioned from a military post to become a comfortable residence for Jeanne of Laval-Châtillon and her son Anne de Montmorency. At the same time, many half-timbered houses and private mansions were built inside the city. These medieval districts are characterized by their sturdy frame construction and their sinuous and dark streets, as well as by a network of lanes. From a defense perspective, these narrow streets were a confusing obstacle to taking the city. The frontages of the houses are made either of half-timbering or stone. The corbellings (projection of the higher floors over the street) helped saved space. They shielded pedestrians from bad weather, and they channeled rainwater into the central gutters, helping preserve the wooden facades.The names of the Vitré's streets often originated from the trade guilds in the area: for example, "Baudrairie Street" was a gathering-place for "baudroyors" (leatherworkers), and there is also a "Street of Pottery".The historical center of the city is the Place du Marchix or Market Square near the Convent of the Benedictines. The current Place of the Castle was the forecourt of the castle. The Place de Notre-Dame formerly hosted a "Market of Fabrics." Vitré, a prosperous city since the 15th century, had a brotherhood for promoting the international trade of textiles, founded in 1472.RenaissanceVitré was a city with an economy among the most flourishing of any city in the Duchy of Brittany. Its peak came in the 16th century when the brotherhoods of the Merchants of Overseas sold their hemp fabric throughout Europe. The merchants built large private mansions, producing the Renaissance elements that now punctuate the closed city. Henri IV passed through Vitré in 1598. He was struck by the opulence of these middle-class men, vitréens, and he exclaimed: "If I were not King of France, I would like to be a middle-class man of Vitré! ".During the Wars of Religion, at the end of 16th century, the Protestant city was besieged for five months by the troops of the League under the command of the duke of Mercoeur, governor of Brittany. During the 17th century, the barons of Vitré deserted the town for the Court of Versailles. The city lost its notoriety and became a quiet place.This situation lasted through 18th century and until the arrival of the railroad in the middle of the 19th century. In addition, the end of the 18th century was marked by the Chouannerie, the end of the seigniory of Vitré and the beginning of a new and important period for the city, its role as a sub-prefecture.The 19th and 20th centuriesTo prepare for the arrival of the railroads, the city decided to destroy the southern fortifications of the city to open up the closed city and to improve visibility. The Door "d'En-Haut" (1835), "Gâtesel" (1839) and "d'En-Bas" were destroyed to make way for developments in the south of the closed city.Vitré has been a railway hub since the first lines were opened on April 15, 1857 on the Paris-Brest line. The construction of the station was carried out in 1855 in the form of a small neo-gothic manor house in the downtown area, just south of the closed city. The city was literally cut in two by this important railway influence. However, in spite of these industrial developments, the city developed little and remained a small market town within an agricultural area. Moreover, it lost its statute of sub-prefecture in 1926.Vitré did not suffer massive destruction during the two World Wars, and preserved its historical inheritance, with the exception of Fougères, which underwent a terrible bombardment in June 1944, destroying a good part of it. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Vitré experienced an economic boom along with the rest of France.From 1950 on, Vitré grew extensively. During "the thirty glorious years," Vitré experienced massive rural migration, like many other towns of France.This migration triggered new building developments, including modern six-story buildings in the "Maison Rouge" district. The city has considerably developed and extended with industrial areas and suburbs. The population of Vitré expanded from 9,611 inhabitants in 1954 to around 17,000 today, an increase of 80% over half a century. Inner-city areas are protected to conserve the town's rich heritage of art and architecture. In 1999, Vitré obtained the label "Town of Art and History" because of its rich cultural inheritance. The town's monuments attract many tourists each year.MonumentsCastlesChâteau de Vitré (11th-20th century)Remparts, Claviers' Tower, Bridole's TowerRochers-Sévigné CastleChâteau-Marie (17th century)Hôtel Ringues de la Troussanais (Renaissance)Medieval streets (Beaudrairie, Poterie, d'Embas, etc.) and places (Marchix, Station, Château, Notre-Dame, etc.)Religious heritageSaint-Nicolas Chapel (near Castle of Vitré)Notre-Dame Church (14th century) gothicTower of the ancient Saint-Martin's Church (15th century)Saint-Martin Church (19th century)Sainte-Croix Church (17th-19th century)Protestant ChurchConvent of Bénédictins (Tribunal)Convent of Augustins (17th century)Chapels, calvaries situated in the city and countrysideOther monumentsMenhir "La Pierre Blanche" (Beauvais Road to Pocé-les-Bois)Hôtel Sévigné-Nétumières (18th Century)The Station (19th century)Old barracks of 70e régiment d'infanterieThe Grand ParkMiscellaneousVitré was the birthplace of:François Dollier de Casson second founder of MontrealPierre Landais, Breton politician (15th century)Jacques Collebaut, composerTancrède Abraham, painterEdouard Frain de La Gaulayrie, curator of Vitré and historian.Bertrand d'Argentré, historian of the BretagneJacquet of Mantua or Jacques Colebault, Renaissance composerPierre-Olivier Malherbe, European explorerClaude-Étienne Savary, translator of the KoranArthur Le Moyne de La Borderie, historian of the BretagneAuguste Pavie et Charles Rabot, explorers, the first: Laos and Cambodia, the second: Kola and SvalbardMorvan Marchal, Breton nationalist, creator of the modern Bretagne flagRené AlexandrePierre Méhaignerie, deputy-mayor of Vitré, former minister and European deputyVitré ConcertsMonsters of Death, 28th September 1991Vitre Jazz Festival, March 2006TransportationLocated east of Brittany, the city of Vitré is crossed by the expressway which prolongs motorway A 11, while the motorway of the Estuaries.
