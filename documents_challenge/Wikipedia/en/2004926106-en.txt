Tauranga is  south-east of Auckland,  east of Hamilton and  north of Rotorua,The "City of Tauranga" was reproclaimed in 2004, after status was lost after 1989 Local Body reforms. The City of Tauranga includes the major suburbs/areas of Tauranga City's Central Business District, The Avenues, Matua, Tauriko(being built), Otumoetai, Bethlehem, Greerton, Ohauiti, Maungatapu and Welcome Bay, as well as the city's northern coastal strip of Mount Maunganui, Omanu, Arataki, Bayfair and Papamoa.Major growth is occurring in this city (the fastest growing in New Zealand), with Papamoa expected to be a small city in itself by 2020, with a population the size of Nelson. (According to SmartGrowth, from Census growth figures and Statistics NZ).LocationTauranga is located around a large harbour which extends along the western Bay of Plenty, and is protected by Matakana Island and the extinct volcano of Mauao.The name Tauranga comes from Māori, it roughly translates to "a sheltered anchorage".Due to its sheltered position on the east coast, Tauranga enjoys a warm, dry climate. This has made it a popular location to retire to. During the summer months the population swells as the holidaymakers descend on the city, especially along the popular white coastal surf beaches from Mount Maunganui to Papamoa.Situated along a faultline, Tauranga & the Bay of Plenty experience infrequent seismic activity, and there are a few volcanoes around the area (mainly dormant). The most notable of these are White Island and Mauao (Mount Maunganui), nicknamed "The Mount" by many locals).Much of the countryside surrounding Tauranga is horticultural land, used to grow a wide range of fresh produce for both domestic consumption and export. The area is particularly well known for growing tangelos (a grapefruit / tangerine cross), avocados, and kiwifruit. Recent years have seen the establishment of boutique vineyards and wineries.The Port of Tauranga is New Zealand's largest export port, with brisk but seasonal shipping traffic. It is a regular stop off for both container ships and luxury cruise liners.PopulationIt is the ninth largest New Zealand city and the centre of the 6th largest urban area, It is expected to be the 5th largest urban area within a few years surpassing Dunedin due to Tauranga having the fastest growing population in New Zealand.AttractionsGreater Tauranga is a very popular retirement and tourism destination. It features many natural attractions and scenery.Due to the temperate climate, outdoor activities are very popular in Tauranga, including golf, tramping (hiking), mountain biking and white water rafting. The Bay of Plenty coastline features miles of golden sandy beaches, and watersports are very popular pastimes. The most common include swimming, surfing, fishing, diving, kayaking & kitesurfing. Tourists also enjoy dolphin-watching on specially run boat trips.The Montana Jazz Festival takes place in Tauranga every Easter, with dozens of live acts, good food and excellent wine.HistoryFirst settlersThe earliest known settlers arrived from the Takitimu and Mataatua waka in the 12th century. It was named "Tauranga", meaning "landing place".VTours - Downtown Tauranga&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Early tradingTraders in flax were active in the Bay of Plenty during the 1830s; some were transient, others married local women and settled permanently. The first permanent trader was James Farrow, who traveled to Tauranga in 1829, obtaining flax fibre for Australian merchants in exchange for muskets and gunpowder. Farrow acquired half an acre of land on 10 January 1838 at Otumoetai Pā from the chiefs Tupaea, Tangimoana and Te Omanu, the earliest authenticated land purchase in the Bay of Plenty.http://ourcity.tauranga.govt.nz/heritage/history/traders/&lt;/ref&gt;MissionariesDuring the 1820s, missionaries from the Bay of Islands visited the Tauranga district to obtain supplies of potatoes, pigs and flax. In 1840, a Catholic mission station was established. Bishop Pompallier was given land within the palisades of Otumoetai Pā for a church and a presbytery. The mission station closed in 1863 due to land wars in the Waikato district.Māori WarsThe Tauranga Campaign took place in and around Tauranga, from 21 January 1864 to 21 June 1864, during the Māori Wars. The Battle of Gate Pa is the most well-known.Modern ageTauranga is the fastest growing city in New Zealand. The population as of the census in 2006 was over 109,100 people, meaning that the city has tripled in size in a little over 25 years. The population increase is due mostly to retirees settling in the city, and sun and surf seekers. It is also a popular lifestyle city. Although the population has increased dramatically, the city is proportionally underrepresented in businesses other than retail which is over-saturated, and the CBD reflects a city of less than half the population as that of Tauranga. This is mainly because of many outer suburb areas having shopping centres including Fraser Cove, Fashion Island and Palm Beach Plaza spreading retail dollars thin in the area as property values and rents are very high. Tauranga has earned the nickname "ten dollar Tauranga" in the past, due to low wage rates, but wages have increased and even the minimum wage is now $12 per hour.Under the Local Government (Tauranga City Council) Order 2003,http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/regs/regs/text/2003/2003275.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Tauranga became (legally) a city for a second time from 1 March 2004.GeographyClimate |accessdate =1971 – 2000 Education Tauranga is home to the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic as well as a branch of the University of Waikato.State secondary schools include:Aquinas College a co-educational state-integrated Catholic school founded in 2003 for years 7 through 13.Tauranga Boys' College, with over 1500 boys.Tauranga Girls' College, with over 1500 girls.Otumoetai College, with around 1900 pupils.Bethlehem College-A Christian educational institution for kindergarten, primary and secondary level studentsMount Maunganui College a co-educational secondary school.Christian educational institutions in Tauranga include Bethlehem Campus, a college for both children and adults established in 1988; Tauranga Adventist School,a state integrated Christian community school catering for Year 1 to 8 students and established in 1974; and Aquinas College, a Catholic college established in 2003.Notable residentsHilda Hewlett - pioneer aviatorPhil Rudd - drummer for AC/DCRichard O'Brien - author of The Rocky Horror Show (spent his formative years here)Les Munro - Dambusters veteran.Bob Clarkson - Member of Parliament and successful property developer and landlordSheryl Jordan - Prominent New Zealand Teen Fiction/Fantasy authorTim Balme - Actor, directorWinston Peters - Former MP for Tauranga, leader of NZ First, politicianSister cities Yantai, China Hitachi, Ibaraki, JapanSister citiesSee alsoPort of TaurangaTauranga BotanicaReferencesExternal linkswww.tauranga.co.nz Your portal for everything in Tauranga, NZ...
