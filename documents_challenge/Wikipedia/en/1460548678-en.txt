Though most of his work has been in film and television, it also includes stage performances; most notably, as the ambivalent gay lawyer Louis Ironson in Declan Donnellan's 1992 and 1993 Royal National Theatre London premières of Parts One (''Millennium Approaches) and Two (Perestroika) of Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, and as Ben, one of two hitmen, playing opposite Lee Evans as Gus, in Harry Burton's 2007 critically-acclaimed 50th-anniversary revival of Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter's 1957 two-hander The Dumb Waiter at Trafalgar Studios. excerpts from several reviews, including some cited below and in [[The Dumb Waiter#Recent productions].]Personal background and educationJason Isaacs was born on 6 June 1963, in Liverpool, Lancashire, in England, to Jewish parents, who later emigrated to Israel, spending his earliest childhood years in an "insular" and "closely-knit" Jewish community of Liverpudlians, of which his Eastern European great-grandparents were founder-members. Rpt. from Jewish Journal of Los Angeles, 14 July 2000. The third of four sons, Isaacs attended a Jewish school and a cheder twice a week as a young adult. When he was 11, he moved with his family to Northwest London, attending the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, in Elstree, Hertsmere, Hertfordshire (Herts), where he was in the same year as film reviewer Mark Kermode. He describes his childhood as "preparation" for portraying the "unattractive", villainous characters whom he has most often played.Following his more traditionally-inclined brothers, who became a doctor, a lawyer, and an accountant, Isaacs studied law at Bristol University (1982–1985), but he became more actively involved in the drama society, eventually performing in over 30 plays and performing each summer at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, first with Bristol University and then, twice, with the National Student Drama Company. After graduating from Bristol he went immediately to train at London's Central School of Speech and Drama (1985–1988).He and his partner, BBC documentary filmmaker Emma Hewitt, whom he began dating at the Central School, have lived together since 1988 and have two daughters: Lily (born 23 March 2002) and Ruby (26 August 2005). Although unmarried, he refers to Hewitt as his "wife".Despite Isaacs' recent screen celebrity as Lucius Malfoy, he maintains a relatively-modest, "calm, sedate and suburban" life, which he prefers to the "hideously compromised lives" of the more rich and famous: "I imagine like most of us that I'd like obscene amounts of money but the people I met and worked with who have those obscene amounts of money and have obscene amounts of fame have awful lives. Really. I mean hideously compromised lives...." Described as an "invisible star" who can still travel by the London Underground to film premières unrecognized, he has observed: "They just think, who's that t*** in black tie? As soon as I get on the red carpet they start screaming and screaming. ... It's laughable because when it's all over I go home on the Tube as well."&lt;/ref&gt; "I can go anywhere. No one knows who I am. I can go on the tube and bus and wander through the streets."CareerAfter completing his training as an actor, Isaacs almost immediately began appearing on the stage and on television; his film debut was in a minor role as a doctor in Mel Smith's The Tall Guy (1989). He was initially known as a TV actor in the UK, with starring roles in the ITV drama Capital City (1989) and the BBC drama Civvies (1992) and guest roles in series such as Taggart and Inspector Morse in 1992. He also played Michael Ryan in ITV1's adaptation of Martina Cole's novel Dangerous Lady, directed by Jack Woods and produced by Lavinia Warner, in 1995..On stage he portrayed the "emotionally waffling" gay Jewish lawyer Louis Ironson in Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, at the Royal National Theatre, in its London première, performing the role in both parts, Part One: Millennium Approaches, in 1992, and Part Two: Perestroika, in 1993. When auditioning for that role, he told the producers, "Look, I play all these tough guys and thugs and strong, complex characters. In real life, I am a cringing, neurotic Jewish mess. Can't I for once play that on stage?"His first Hollywood role was in the Bruce Willis blockbuster Armageddon (1998). Initially called upon to take a fairly substantial role, Isaacs was eventually cast in a much smaller capacity as a planet-saving scientist so that he could accommodate his commitment to Divorcing Jack (1998), a comedy thriller he was making with future fellow Harry Potter cast member David Thewlis.After portraying a priest opposite Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes in Neil Jordan's acclaimed adaptation of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair (1999), Isaacs played the "memorable" villain, Colonel William Tavington, in Roland Emmerich's Revolutionary War fictional film epic The Patriot (2000). Starring opposite Mel Gibson as the film's hero, and Heath Ledger as Gibson's screen son, Isaacs portrays a sadistic British army officer who kills Ledger's character, among many other soldiers. Although his work in the film earned him comparisons to Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Amon Göth in Schindler's List (1993) and mention of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, reaching beyond being typecast as an historical villain, Isaacs chose to play a drag queen in his next project, Sweet November (2001), a romantic comedy-drama starring Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves.Isaacs has appeared in many other films, most notably as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series of films (2002–present). Regarding the Harry Potter books by J. K. Rowling, Isaacs has said: "I went off and read the books after the audition and I read all four books in one sitting – you know – didn't wash, didn't eat, drove around with them on the steering wheel like a lunatic. I suddenly understood why my friends, who I'd thought were slightly backward, had been so addicted to these children's books. They're like crack." In "The Naked and the Dead", an article published in the San Francisco Chronicle, on 26 November 2006, Neva Chonin names the character Lucius Malfoy one of the 12 "Sexiest Men Who Were Never Alive" and Isaacs one of the 13 "Sexiest Men Who Are Real and Alive".Prior to the making of the film, when asked whether or not he would be in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), Isaacs replied, "I hope so - you'll have to ask David [[David Heyman]]. I can't bear the idea that somebody else would get to wear my Paris Hilton wig, but you never know." Isaac also talked to J. K. Rowling on the inclusion of Lucius Malfoy in the then as-yet unpublished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, so that he would have a part in the seventh and final film: "The character does not appear in the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince; but ... joked, 'I fell to my knees and begged ... It didn't do any good. I'm sure she doesn't need plot ideas from me. But I made my point. We'll see. Like everybody else, I'm holding my breath to July to see what's in there. I just want to bust out of prison, that's all. I don't want to stay in Azkaban most of my life.'&nbsp;" However, on 12 September 2008, AceShowBiz.com revealed that Isaacs is indeed reprising his role of Lucius Malfoy as a cameo appearance in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), where he is seen in a moving portrait. Afterwards, Isaacs will be reprising the role again in both parts of David Yates's film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (expected release, 2010 and 2011).He has also appeared in Dragonheart (1996), Event Horizon (1997) , Black Hawk Down (2001), Jackie Chan's The Tuxedo (2002), and as George Darling and Captain Hook in P. J. Hogan's adaptation of Peter Pan (2003), and as the voice of Admiral Zhao in the animated Nickelodeon series Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005).Isaacs played the leading role of Sir Mark Brydon, the British Ambassador to the United States in the BBC Four miniseries The State Within (2006), for which he was nominated for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television for the 65th Golden Globe Awards. On British television, he also portrayed actor Harry H. Corbett in The Curse of Steptoe, part of "a season of new one-off dramas for BBC Four revealing the stories behind some of Britain's best loved television entertainers, and their achievements," first broadcast in March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On American television, Isaacs appeared in three episodes of The West Wing in 2004, prior to developing his most notable TV serial role, as Michael Caffee in Brotherhood (2006–present).Between 2 February and 24 March 2007, Isaacs played Ben, opposite Lee Evans (Gus), in the critically-acclaimed 50th-anniversary production of Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter, at Trafalgar Studios, in London, his first theatre performance since appearing in The Force of Change (2000). He posed for photographs after his performance on 3 March 2007.Issacs plays Major Briggs, an American military officer, opposite Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear, in the upcoming film of Paul Greengrass's thriller Green Zone (2009), a fictionalized drama set in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein based on the book Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Baghdad's Green Zone (2006), by Rajiv Chandrasekaran, for which production began in Morocco, in January 2008.In 2007 he was cast in Jan de Bont's then-still-upcoming film "Stopping Power", to play its star John Cusack's "nemesis", but, on 31 August 2007, ''Variety reported that the film, also planned for release in 2009, had been canceled after a financial backer pulled out.Selected workFilmYearFilmRoleAwards and nominations1989The Tall GuyDoctor #21994Shopping]]''Market Trader1995Solitaire For TwoHarry1996DragonheartLord Felton1997Event Horizon]]''D.J.1998Armageddon]]''Dr. Ronald Quincy, ResearchDivorcing Jack]]''Cow Pat KeeganSoldier]]''MekumSt. Ives]]''Alain de Keroual de Saint-Yves1999The End of the AffairFather Richard Smythe2000The Patriot]]''British Colonel William Tavington2001Sweet November]]''Chaz WatleyBlack Hawk Down]]''US Army Captain Mike Steele2002Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''Lucius Malfoy]]PassionadaCharles BeckResident Evil]]''Dr. William Birkin (uncredited)The TuxedoClark DevlinWindtalkersMajor Mellitz2003Peter Pan]]''George Darling]] and Captain Hook2004Nouvelle-FranceGénéral James WolfeResident Evil: ApocalypseDr. William Birkin2005The ChumscrubberMr. ParkerElektra]]''DeMarco (uncredited)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''Lucius Malfoy]]Nine Lives]]''DamianTennis, Anyone...?Johnny Green2006Friends with MoneyDavid2007Grindhouse]], in the ''faux trailer "Don't"Bearded ManHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''Lucius Malfoy2008Good]]''MauriceLa Conjura de El EscorialAntonio Pérez2009"Green Zone"]]Major BriggsHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''Lucius Malfoy]]2010"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I"]]Lucius Malfoy]]2011"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"]]Lucius Malfoy]]Some of the information in this table was obtained from TelevisionYear(s)of appearanceProgramme or seriesRoleAwards and nominations1989A Quiet Conspiracy1989This Is David LanderFrench Doctor1989(2 seasons)Capital CityChas Ewell1989BoonMike Puckett1990TECXEdward Latham1991AshendenAndrew Lehman1991Eye ContactMichael1992CivviesFrank Dillon1992(1 episode)Inspector Morse (1997 – 2000)"Cherubim and Seraphim"Dr. Desmond Collier1992(1 episode)Taggart (1983–present)"Double Exposure"Barr1993(1 episode)Highlander: The Series (1992 – 1998)"The Lady and the Tiger"Immortal Zachary Blaine1995A Relative StrangerPeter Fairman1995Dangerous LadyMichael Ryan1995(TV movie)Loved UpDes1996 (TV movie)GuardiansJim Reid1996 (TV movie)Burn Your PhoneThe Killer1997(TV movie)The FixTony Kaye1998The Last Don IIFather Luca Tonarini2004(3 episodes)The West Wing (1999 – 2006)"Gaza""Memorial Day""N.S.F.
