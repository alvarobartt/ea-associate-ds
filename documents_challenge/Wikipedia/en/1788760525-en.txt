"Cebuano" redirects here. For the inhabitants of Cebu, see Cebuano peopleCebuano (Cebuano: Sinugbuanon, "language of the Cebuanos") is an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines by about 20,000,000 people (according to Ethnologue). It is a member of the Visayan languages, and is thus also commonly referred to as Visayan (Cebuano: Binisaya, "language of the Visayans"). The name came from the Philippine island of Cebu, the site of the second-largest metropolitan area in the country. Cebuano is given the ISO 639-2 three letter code ceb, but has no ISO 639-1 two letter code.Geographic distributionCebuano is spoken natively by the inhabitants of Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, western parts of Leyte and Biliran islands, southern third of Masbate island and throughout the most of Mindanao. It is also spoken in a few towns and islands in Samar. Until 1975, Cebuano surpassed Tagalog in terms of total number of speakers, but Cebuano still has more native speakers than Tagalog. Migrations from Cebu, Bohol, and Negros Oriental mostly to Mindanao and vice versa increase the Cebuano-speaking population of the Philippines. Some dialects of Cebuano give different names to the language. Residents of Bohol may refer to Cebuano as Bol-anon while Cebuano-speakers in Leyte may call their dialect Kana. Speakers in Mindanao and Metro Manila refer to the language simply as Binisaya or Bisaya.Cebuano is also spoken by Warays in Samar and Leyte, Porohanon in Poro, Ilonggos in Negros Oriental, Eskaya in Bohol, and by native (like Atas, Bagobos, Butuanons, Maranaos, and Tausugs) and migrant Filipino ethnic groups (like Ilocanos and Ilonggos), foreign ethnic groups (like Spaniards, Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans), and other peoples in Mindanao as second language. Cebuano is a language with the Verb Subject Object sentence order, in which the first term in the sentence is the term given emphasis. Nouns and adjectives are joined by the nga connector with their order arbitrary as long as the nga connector is in between them. Orthography and phonology Cebuano has 21 phonemes. There are sixteen consonants: p, t, k,  (the glottal stop), b, d, g, m, n, ng, s, h, w, l, r, and y. There are five vowels: i, e, a, o, and u.VowelsBefore the arrival of the Spanish, Cebuano had three vowel phonemes: , , and . This was later expanded to five vowels with the introduction of Spanish words. The vowels o''' and '''u are still mostly allophones, however, with u''' always being used when it is the beginning of a syllable, and '''o always used when it ends a syllable. But there are some exceptions, like kamatuoran (truth) and hangtúd (until). "E" originally appeared only in a few words such as "babaye" (girl/woman), "dayeg" (praise, complement), "parayeg" (loving), and "pangadye" (prayer) and only in last syllables as "E" was mostly an allophone of "I" in final syllables. With the influence of Spanish, more words with e has been added with the introduction of loanwords.The vowels are: an open front unrounded vowel similar to English "f'a'ther" an open-mid front unrounded vowel similar to English "b'e'd" a close front unrounded vowel similar to English "mach'i'ne" a close-mid back rounded vowel similar to English "f'o'rty" a close back unrounded vowel similar to English "fl'u'te"ConsonantsBelow is a chart of Cebuano consonants. All the stops are unaspirated. The velar nasal occurs in all positions including at the beginning of a word.Bilabial]]Dental]]Palatal]]Velar]]Glottal]]NasalPlosiveVoicelessVoicedFricativeFlapLateralApproximantStressAccent is also a distinguisher of words, so that dápit means "to invite", while dapít means "near" or "nearby place". Consonants d and ɾ were once allophones, but cannot interchange, like kabungturan (uplands) [from bungtód, mountain] is correct but not *kabungtudan and tagadihá (from there) [from dihá, there] is correct but not *tagarihá.GrammarNounsWhile Cebuano nouns are not inflected, they are usually preceded by case markers. There are three types of case markers: kinsa (nominative), tag-iya (genitive), and gitagan-an.Unlike English or Spanish which are nominative-accusative languages, Cebuano is an ergative-absolutive language. This may have led to a misconception about Cebuano as being often spoken in a passive voice.Kinsa or nominative markers mark the topic of most sentences and both the topic and complementary predicate of an equational sentence. Tag-iya or genitive markers mark the owner of the thing or the doer of an action. Gitagan-an markers are similar to prepositions in English. They mark things such as location and direction. Furthermore, noun markers are divided into two classes: one for names of people (personal) and the second for everything else (general).Below is a chart of case markers. Mga (pronounced maˈŋa) marks the plural.&nbsp;KinsaTag-iyaGitagan-angeneral singularangsasageneral pluralang mgasa mgasa mgapersonal singularsini*kangPersonal pluralsila si/ silangnila ni/ nilang*kanila ni/ kanilang*Tag-iya case functions like an adjective. Sometimes an adjective acts as a complementary predicate. When a ''tag-iya case noun is a complementary predicate it uses kang in singular and ila ni/ilang in plural.''Examples:Miabot si Manang Kcy. has-arrived Manang Kcy "Manang Kcy has arrived."Gwapo si Roland Christian. Handsome is Roland Christian. "Roland Christian is Handsome."Nakit-an ni Nicoy si Janx. did-see Nicoy Janx "Nicoy saw Janx."Mangadto silang Karlatoot ug Susiedear sa balay ni Jedd. Will-go Karlatoot and Susiedear to-the house of Jedd "Karlatoot and Susiedear will go to Jedd's house."Hain ang mga libro? At-where the those book(s) "Where are the books?"To-a kang Williever ang yawe. At with Williever the keys "Williever has the keys."PronounsLike nouns, personal pronouns are categorized by case.&nbsp;KinsaTag-iya(primary)*Tag-iya(modifier)**Oblique1st person singularakoakoa***nakokanako2nd person singularikawimohanimokanimo3rd person singularsiya / syaiyaha /iyaniyakaniya1st person plural inclusivekitaatoa / atonatokanato1st person plural exclusivekamiamoa / amonamokanamo2nd person pluralkamoinyohaninyokaninyo3rd person pluralsilailahanilakanila*There are two sets of tag-iya case and they function similarly except that the primary tag-iya would need the unifying linker nga and... **the modifier tag-iya cannot be used as complementary adjective. ***The final syllable of a primary tag-iya pronoun is mostly dropped.When the pronoun is not the first word of the sentence, the short form is more commonly used than the full form.&nbsp;KinsaTag-iya(primary)Tag-iya(modifier)Oblique1st person singularko*akokonako2nd person singularkaimomonimo3rd person singularsiyaiyaniyaniya1st person plural inclusiveta**atonatonato1st person plural exclusivemiamonamonamo2nd person pluralkamoinyoninyoninyo3rd person pluralsilailanilanila*When the object is a second person pronoun do not use ko, use ta instead. **When the object is a second person pronoun ta means first person singular. Examples:Misulat ko. "I wrote."Gisulatan ko niya. "He/She wrote me a letter."Akong ihatag niya. "I will give it to him/her."Modifier tag-iya pronouns follow the word they modify. Primary tag-iya pronouns can take the place of the modifier tag-iya pronoun but they precede the word they modify.'''Ang balay ko. Ang akong balay.''' "My house."Especial attention should be given to the short form ta. When the subject is second person it mean first person singular.Mahal ta ka. "I love you."Tagaan ta mo og kwarta. "I will give you money."Nakit-an ta mo gahapon sa tindahan. "I saw you at the store yesterday."Higala ta ka. "You are my friend."The inclusive pronoun kita refers to the first and second persons. It may also refer to a third person(s).The exclusive pronoun kamí refers to the first and third persons but excludes the second.Wala tay bugas. "We (you and I) don't have rice."Wala miy bugas. "We (someone else and I, but not you) don't have rice."The short form is often used when the pronoun is not the first word in the sentence.The pronouns are gender neutral, hence siyá means either he or she.Demonstrative PronounsCebuano demonstrative pronouns are as follows.&nbsp;KinsaTag-iyaGitagan-an*Nearest to speaker (this, here)kiri(ri)**iringariNear speaker and addressee (this, here)kini(ni)ininganhiNearest addressee (that, there)kana(na)ananganhaRemote (yon, yonder)kadto(to)atongadto*The ng- form can be replaced with the d- form so intead of ngari, nganhi, nganha, ngadto one can use diri, dinhi, dinha, didto. **The one in parenthesis is the short form which is often used when a pronoun is not the first word in the sentence. Examples:Unsa ni? What this? "What's this?"Kinsa nang tawhana? Who that man? "Who is that man?"Gikan ni Pedro ning sulata. From (ni=adjective) Pedro this letter "This letter is from Pedro."Mangaon sila didto. Will-eat they there "They will eat there."Mikaon ana ang bata. Ate that the child. "The child ate (some of) that."VerbsCebuano verbs are morphologically complex and take on a variety of affixes reflecting focus, aspect, mode, and others.AspectCebuano verbs conjugate for aspect rather than for tense. Cebuano verbs indicate whether you are still going to start the act or not going to start it anymore. There are three types of aspect: imperative, incepted, and incepting.imperative aspect - for giving commandsincepted aspect - past actions and present actions that are not habitual. While habitual may have been started somewher in the past or the present, the fact that you are still have to start it again in the future make it in the incepting aspect.incepting aspect - future actions and habitual actionsExamples on INCEPTED ASPECT:Past actions 1. I '''went' to Europe.'' The act had been started in the past therefore the Cebuano translation is: ''Miadto ko sa Uropa .'' 2. I finally '''found' you,'' The act had been started in the past therefore the Cebuano translation is: ''Nakaplagan ra gyud'' ta ka.Present actions 1. I '''am going' to the kitchen.'' The act has been started before the statement is spoken therefore the Cebuano translation is: ''Nagpadulong ko sa kusina.'' 2. Peter '''finds' Miriam.'' The act has been started before the statement is spoken therefore the Cebuano translation is: ''Nakaplagan ni Pedro si Miriam.''Examples of INCEPTING ASPECTFuture actions 1. I '''will return' this Christmas.'' The act has not happen yet therefore is has not yet started: ''Mobalik ko karong Pasko.'' 2. She '''will find' you.'' The act has not happen yet therefore is has not yet started: Iya kang '''makit-an.'''Habitual actions 1. She '''goes' to the shore every morning.'' Although the act had already happened she will still have to start the same act again and again (every morning) so the act itself is still to be started or pagasugdan pa and therefore: ''Moadto siya matag buntag sa baybayon.'' 2. He always '''finds' her there.'' Although the act had already happened she will still have to start the same act again and again (always) so the act itself is still to be started or pagasugdan pa and therefore: Kanunay siya niyang '''makaplagan' didto.''FocusAn interesting feature of verbs in Cebuano and in other Philippine languages is its orientation (focus) system. This means that the role or relationship of the topic (marked by the absolutive marker) is reflected in the verb.There are nine common orientation types: um verbs, pag verbs, pang verbs, ka verbs, magka verbs, on verbs, an verbs, i verbs and reciprocative.um verbsFormimperativeinceptedinceptingwala base-(um)-mi-mo-mo-Function - this form is used for either of the following conditionsone is emphasising that the action happen in an instanceone is emphasising that the doer willed the actType of topic - the doer is the topic.pag verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala basepag-nag-mag-mag-Functions - expresses actions that eitherhappen for a duration of timedo not imply doer intentionType of topic - talks about the doerpang verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala basepang-nang-mang-mang-Function - pluritive form of um verbsType of topic - talks about the doerka verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala baseka-na-ma-ma-Function - talks about changesType of topic - the topic is the one who undergoes the changemagka verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala basenonenagka-magka-magka-Function - talks about a slow but steady changeType of topic - the topic is the one who undergoes the changereciprocating verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala basepag-in-aynag-in-aymag-in-aymag-in-ayFunction - reciprocating actionsType of topic - at least two persons/things doing reciprocating actions to each otheron verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala base-agi--on-aFunction - the direct object is often the topic, mostly misunderstood as similar to English passive voicean verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala base-igi-an-an-iFunction - the indirect object is often the topic, mostly misunderstood as similar to English passive voicei verbsFormsimperativeinceptedinceptingwala basei-gi-i-i-Function - the instrument used is often the topic, mostly misunderstood as similar to English passive voicemoodsThere three moods in Cebuano: intuitive, non-intuitive, and aptativeintuitive - the intuitive mood is the normal mood of the verb, the one whose form you have just learned.non-intuitive - the non-intuitive mood is used to express unexpected or unintended actions.

However if nga follows a word ending in a vowel or glottal stop or the letter N, then it becomes suffixed to that word as ''-ng''. The adjective often come before the word it modifies but it can also come after it.Ex: maayong buntag = a good morning 'dakong panon ' = a large crowd mga matang malulot = beautiful eyesA noun however always comes after the word it modifies.Ex: balay nga bato = stone house hangin nga habagat = southeast monsoonSuperlative are expressed by adding the affix kina--an or the particle labing Ex: kinamaayohan = best kinadak-an = largest labing malulot = the most prettyComparative are express by adding the particle mas or labawng.Enclitic ParticlesCebuano has enclitic particles that have important information conveying difference nuances in meaning.Below is a list of some enclitic particles.na and pana: now, already, yetpa: still, else, in addition, yetman: particle used for disregarding reasons or results; even, even if, althoughpud,sad: too, alsolamang (lang): limiting particle; only or justdaw, kuno: a reporting particle that expresses that the information in the sentence is second-hand; they say, he said, reportedly, supposedly, etc.gyud: politeness particleba: used in yes-and-no questions and optionally in other types of questionssa: for now, for a minute and yet (in negative sentences).kaha: expresses wonder; I wonder; perhaps (we should do something) (also optionally used in yes-and-no questions and other forms of questions)kay: expresses cause; becausediay: expresses that the speaker has realized or suddenly remembered something; realization particletingali: expresses uncertainty; probably, perhaps, seemsunta: expresses hope, unrealized condition (with verb in incepting aspect), used in conditional sentences.Ten types of sentences1) equational ( topic = predicate ) ~ in this sentence type you can interchange the topic and the predicate without changing the thought of the sentence  a) &quot;Mao kini ang Kabisay-an&quot;.              = This is the Visayas.
  b) &quot;Siya si Oscar.&quot;                        = He is Oscar.
  c) &quot;Mao ’na ang amoang balay&quot;              = That is our house.2) non-equational ( topic  "I will not work tomorrow."Dili dato tong babayhana. "The woman is not rich."Wala negates existentials and incepted verbs.Wala koy kwarta. "I do not have money."Wala ko motrabaho tibuok adlaw. "I did not work the whole day."Ayaw is used in expressing negative commands.Ayaw og hilak. "Don't cry."Ayaw mo pagdagan-dagan dinhi. "Don't run here."Interrogative WordsUnsa? What?Asa? Where?

How much?Diay ba? Really?The use of asa and hainAsa and hain&mdash;both mean where&mdash;have distinct uses in formal Cebuano usage.Asa is used when asking about a place.Asa ka padulong? (Where are you going?)Asa ta molarga? (Where are we traveling to?)Hain is used when asking about a person or thing.Hain na ang gunting? (Where is the pair of scissors?)Hain na si Arsenia? (Where is Arsenia?)In spoken Cebuano, however, asa is commonly used to replace hain. You rarely hear hain being used, except by older generations of Cebuano-speakers. This phenomenon is analogous to Tagalog-speakers not distinguishing between saan (asa) and nasaan (hain) in colloquial speech and instead using saan for both.Vocabulary and borrowed wordsCebuano has long borrowed words from Spanish, such as krus [cruz] (cross), swerte (originally suerte, meaning "luck"), guapa (meaning "beautiful"), merkado (originally mercado, meaning "market"), and brilyante (originally brillante, which translates as "brilliant"). It has several hundred loan words from English as well, which are altered to conform to the limited phonemic inventory of Cebuano: brislit (bracelet), hayskul (high school), syápin (shopping), and dráyber (driver). There are also words from other languages like Arabic like Salámat (meaning "thanks"), or Hukom (originally from "Hukm", meaning "judge") and Islamic words used in Mindanao like Imam, Syarip, dyihad, and Islam, and Sanskrit Mahárlika (from ''Mahardikka, meaning "nobility") and Karma.NumbersCardinalOrdinal1usàúna2duhàika-duhà3tulòika-tulò4upàtika-upàt5limàika-limà6unòmika-unòm7pitòika-pitò8walòika-walò9siyàmika-siyàm10napú'ô/napuloika-napú'ô/ika-napulo11napú'ô'g usá/napulo'g/napulo ug usá/onse (Spanish words are used for numbers greater than 10)ika-napú'ô'g usá/ika-napulo'g usá/ika-napulo ug usá/ika-onse20kawhaan/bente30katlo-an/trenta100usa ka gatos/syento1000usa ka libo/mil100,000usa ka gatos ka libo/syento-mil500,000lima ka gatos ka libo/tunga sa milyon/singko-syento-mil1000000usa ka milyonNote: Shorter terms are the one mostly used.Common expressionsI am Sean.

To some extent, there was active resistance shown against its usage. For instance, the Philippine national anthem is sometimes sung in Cebuano and not in Filipino in the island province of Cebu. This resistance does not aim to threaten the country's national sovereignty and in fact is often done as a patriotic act by Cebuano-speaking Filipinos.Historically, Cebu is the first and oldest Spanish settlement in the Philippines. Long before Manila fell into the hands of the Spanish Conquerors in the 16th century, Cebu was already an established trading and military post for the Spaniards.Linguistically, Cebuano is recently, the country's second most widely used language. During the independence, it was the first largest linguistic group. Cebuano, though originally spoken only in the islands around Cebu, Bohol, and Siquijor and several enclaves in the northern shore of Mindanao is now being spoken in many parts of Mindanao as well and in the western half of the islands of Leyte and Biliran and the eastern half of the island of Negros.Strategically, due to its geographical location, Cebu is the alternate gateway to Manila adding significance to its language. Cebuano is the native language of more regions than Tagalog, being the language with the most native speakers in Region VII (Central Visayas), Region IX (Western Mindanao), Region X (Northern Mindanao), Region XI (Davao Region), Caraga Region, and Region XII (Southern Mindanao), and lingua franca speakers in latter 5 regions and even Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). There are also significant number of speakers in Region VI (Western Visayas, mostly in San Carlos City and neighboring areas) and Region VIII (Eastern Visayas, mostly in western Leyte and Southern Leyte). By comparison, Tagalog is the language of the majority in the NCR, Region IV-A, Region IV-B, and Region III (Central Luzon, where Kapampangan and Ilocano also dominate some areas).See alsoCebuano grammarBoholano dialectVisayan languagesBisalogBislishCebuano literatureVicente Sotto, the "Father of Modern Cebuano Journalism, Literature & Language"Languages of the PhilippinesExternal linksEthnologue report for CebuanoA Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan by John U.
