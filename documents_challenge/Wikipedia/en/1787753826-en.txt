An extension of the Saimaa Canal passes through the town. The town became an industrial center in the end of the 19th century with the A. Ahlström paper mills. During the Finnish Civil War in 1918 the town was taken over by the "Reds", but because of its isolated location in rural Finland, it was soon taken by the "Whites".Twin townsVarkaus is twinned with:External linkshttp://www.varkaus.fiCategory:Municipalities of Northern Savonia Regionde:Varkaus et:Varkaus es:Varkaus fr:Varkaus ga:Varkaus it:Varkaus nl:Varkaus pl:Varkaus pt:Varkaus ro:Varkaus ru:Варкаус se:Varkaus fi:Varkaus (kaupunki) sv:Varkaus
