He currently plays for Portsmouth as a striker. His height of 6&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in (2.01&nbsp;m) makes him the tallest man ever to play for the England national team, as well as the tallest player currently in the Premier League.  He is currently dating model Abbey Clancy.Club careerEarly lifeAlthough born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Crouch's family soon moved south to London. When Crouch was four, the family moved again, this time to Singapore, although they stayed there for only a year before returning to London. A keen footballer from an early age, he became a ballboy at the age of ten. As a child, he attended some Chelsea games with his father. Later, he told the Liverpool official website that despite this, he and his friends at the time were fans of Queens Park Rangers.After attending Drayton Manor High School in Hanwell, Crouch signed a professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur on 2 July 1998, after having played for their youth side. However, he did not make any appearances for their first team and was loaned out to other clubs, having brief spells at Dulwich Hamlet in the Isthmian League and, in the summer of 2000, IFK Hässleholm in Sweden.QPR and PortsmouthOn 28 July 2000, Tottenham sold Crouch to Queens Park Rangers (QPR) for £60,000. He made an immediate impression with QPR, scoring ten league goals in the 2000–01 season, but it was not enough to prevent the team's relegation to Division&amp;nbsp;2 (now Football League One).Relegation meant that QPR had to sell many of their best players to support their diminished finances, and Portsmouth bought Crouch from them for £1.25&nbsp;million. Crouch scored 18 league goals in 37 starts for Portsmouth &mdash; benefiting from the crossing of Robert Prosinečki &mdash; and that in a side that for much of the season looked destined for mid-table mediocrity.Aston VillaIn March 2002, FA Premier League side Aston Villa made a successful £5&nbsp;million bid for Crouch. He scored on his home debut for Villa, the equalising goal against Newcastle United, and managed to net twice in seven games. However, Crouch failed to hold down a regular place in the Aston Villa side in the following 2002–03 season.Looking for first team football, he was loaned to Norwich City from September to December 2003. Although he scored only four times in 15 appearances, he was highly impressive and remains to this day popular with Norwich City supporters. So popular, in fact, he had a song made up about him ("He's tall, he's lean, he's a freaky goal machine"). Crouch was sent off for retaliation during Norwich's 3–1 win at Walsall, but nonetheless his spell at Norwich renewed interest in his abilities from other clubs. At the end of the three-month loan he returned to Aston Villa, and scored a brace against Leicester City, a late winner at Middlesbrough and the opener at Bolton. Norwich City recognised his contribution to the 2003–04 season that saw them win the First Division Championship by awarding him a championship medal. He was presented with the medal on the pitch prior to City's match against his new club Southampton FC at Carrow Road in November 2004. When he came on as substitute for Southampton later that afternoon, he received a very good reception from the home crowd.Villa sold Crouch in July 2004 to Southampton for a fee of £2 million. Crouch signed a four-year deal with Southampton. He scored just six goals in 37 Premiership games for Aston Villa.SouthamptonDespite intially being back-up to first choice strikers James Beattie and Kevin Phillips, Harry Redknapp's arrival and the sale of Beattie saw Crouch become the main attacking focus of the Southampton team. He scored many key goals in Southampton's relegation battle, including memorable goals against Liverpool in a 2–0 home win, Arsenal in a 1–1 home draw and 2 away to Middlesbrough in a 3–1 victory. He also scored a late winning penalty to knock former club and Saints' arch-rival Portsmouth out of the FA Cup. His form for the Saints eventually resulted in him receiving his first England call up. After scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances during the 2004–05 season, his future was cast into doubt when Southampton were relegated from the English Premiership. On 19 July 2005, Southampton agreed to sell Crouch for £7 million to Liverpool, on a four-year contract.LiverpoolCrouch underwent intense media scrutiny due to a goal drought during his first months at Liverpool. For 19 games, spanning four months, he was unable to score. Crouch was praised for other facets of his game, such as his touch on the ball, but his first goal for the club evaded him. The fact that Crouch possessed "good touch for a big man" in fact became something of a media cliché during this time. Early in his Liverpool career the supporters composed a new chant; "He's big, he's red, his feet stick out the bed, Peter Crouch, Peter Crouch."The drought finally ended on 3 December 2005 when he scored against Wigan Athletic. He dedicated the goal to childhood friend, Darren McGirl, who encouraged him during this difficult period. Although this first goal was originally given as an own goal, it was later awarded to Crouch on appeal; he went on to score a second goal in the same game. Prior to these goals, Crouch had played over 24 hours of football for Liverpool without scoring. In addition to this, he also had to deal with unpleasant taunts from crowds at matches, as he had throughout his footballing career, who often chanted "freak" at him due to his unusual height.He went on to score several more goals that season, including the only goal in the fifth round of the FA Cup (2005–06) against Manchester United, Liverpool's first victory over them in the FA Cup post-World War II. On 13 May, he helped Liverpool to win the 2006 FA Cup final against West Ham, providing a crucial assist for Steven Gerrard to score the second Liverpool goal.Three months later, in the curtain-raiser to the 2006–07 season, he headed the winning goal for Liverpool in the club's 2–1 victory over Chelsea in the FA Community Shield. In their 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign he scored his first goals in European club competition. On 13 January 2007, he scored two goals in an away game against Watford, the first time he had scored twice in an away league game for Liverpool. Crouch sustained a broken nose when playing against Sheffield United in February 2007. Although he played in some subsequent games, on 9 March 2007 it was announced that he would undergo surgery on the injury which would keep him out of football for a month. On 31 March, he returned to action after the operation and scored the first hat-trick of his club career, against Arsenal in a 4–1 Liverpool victory. This was also a so-called "Perfect Hat-Trick", consisting of goals scored from his right foot, left foot and head.He later participated in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, coming on as a substitute for Javier Mascherano. He ended the 2006–07 season as Liverpool's top goalscorer in all competitions, with eighteen goals. At the start of the 2007–08 season he has had restricted opportunities to play for Liverpool due to the arrival of other strikers, but scored against Toulouse in a Champions League qualifying win in August, his eighth goal in his past ten appearances in that competition, and then also scoring the first and last goals of an 8–0 win over Besiktas in the first round of the Champions League in November. This match is now the highest margin by which a team has won in the Champions League. In April, he scored a vital goal in a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, helping Liverpool maintain fourth spot against rivals Everton.Return to PortsmouthOn 7 July 2008, after weeks of speculation, it was announced that Crouch had verbally agreed to join former club and FA Cup holders Portsmouth in a deal estimated to be worth up to £11 million. Crouch passed his medical the following day, and, on 11 July, Crouch's transfer was officially unveiled at a Portsmouth news conference. Portsmouth paid £9 million up front, with up to £2m to be added dependent on various targets being reached. He was given the number 9 shirt by manager Harry Redknapp, which he had previously worn during his first spell at the club. On 30 August 2008, Crouch scored his first goal since his return to Portsmouth in his third Premiership appearance, against Everton at Goodison Park. As with his first Liverpool goal there was a degree of uncertainty as to whether he would be credited with the goal as it appeared Jermain Defoe's chip had crossed the goaline before Crouch scored from the follow-up. On 3 September, it was confirmed that the goal would be officially credited to Crouch and not Defoe. Crouch then went on to net his first goal at Portsmouth's Fratton Park home ground in the Premier League against Tottenham Hotspur on September 28.Some Portsmouth fans even made their own version of Norwich and Liverpool's song up, with some fans singing "He's big, he's blue, his girlfriend's tasty too, Peter Crouch, Peter Crouch!"On 2 October 2008, Crouch scored twice in extra time in a UEFA Cup match away to Vitória Guimarães to help Portsmouth reach the group stages of the competition.International careerYouth internationalCrouch was capped for the England Under-20 team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, with team-mates including Stuart Taylor, Ashley Cole, Andrew Johnson and Matthew Etherington. However, the team finished bottom at the group stage, with three losses and having scored no goals. He was later a part of David Platt's England Under-21 team, which went to the finals of the European Under–21 Championship in Switzerland in May 2002, where he scored once.Breakthrough into senior teamIn May 2005, he was handed his first call-up to the England senior squad by manager Sven-Göran Eriksson for the team's tour of the United States, making his debut against Colombia. He went on to make two appearances during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign for England: starting against Austria in a 1–0 victory and coming on as a substitute against Poland in a 2–1 win. In the latter appearance, Crouch's introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England's own supporters.On 1 March 2006, he scored his first goal for England, the equaliser in a 2–1 friendly win over Uruguay. He did this whilst bizarrely wearing two different squad numbers on his shirt &mdash; #21 on the front (his designated squad number for the match), and the incorrect #12 on the back.In May 2006, Crouch was included in the 23 man England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was expected to be a significant figure in the team due to Wayne Rooney's foot injury. On 30 May 2006, he played in a pre-World Cup friendly against Hungary, scoring the third goal in England's 3–1 win. He followed his goal with an unusual robotic dancing-style goal celebration &mdash; see below. On 3 June he again played for England in a pre-World Cup friendly against Jamaica, scoring a hat-trick. Between his second and third goals he took a penalty kick hoping to gain a hat-trick, but he put the ball over the bar. England went on to win 6–0, Crouch securing his hat-trick in the 89th minute with a fine finish &mdash; his fifth goal in three England games.World Cup 2006After his displays in England's friendlies, Crouch partnered Michael Owen in attack for England's opening 2006 FIFA World Cup game against Paraguay on 10 June 2006. England won the game 1–0 and Crouch kept his place in the starting line-up for the following match against Trinidad and Tobago, against whom he scored his first competitive international goal. The goal provoked some controversy as replays showed Crouch to be pulling on Brent Sancho's long hair, holding the defender down, to gain an advantage.Crouch was rested for England's third group game against Sweden as Rooney returned from injury to join the starting line-up. However, Michael Owen suffered an injury in the opening minute of the game and Crouch replaced him, playing the remainder of the match.In England's 1–0 second round victory against Ecuador, Crouch remained an unused substitute as Eriksson switched the team to a new formation with Wayne Rooney as a lone striker. However, after Rooney's dismissal for a foul in England's quarter-final against Portugal, Crouch came on as a substitute for Joe Cole.The year after the tournament, retired English referee Graham Poll claimed that FIFA had specifically warned referees at the event to pay close attention to Crouch, claiming that "he's a real pain and he's getting away with too much."Euro 2008 qualifyingCrouch remained a part of the England set-up under Eriksson's successor as manager, Steve McClaren, and started McClaren's first game in charge, a friendly against Greece in August 2006. He scored twice in England's 4–0 victory. Two further goals followed in England's next match, a 5-0 win over Andorra in their opening qualifying match for the 2008 European Championships on 2 September 2006. These goals made Crouch the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year.He added a further goal to his tally with the winner in England's 1–0 qualifying victory away to Macedonia on 6 September. An operation needed for a nose injury he sustained playing for Liverpool prevented him from playing in England's two qualifying matches in March 2007. He returned to the England squad for their games against Brazil and Estonia in late May and early June 2007, scoring in the qualifying game against the latter.Crouch was England's top scorer in the qualifying campaign with five goals, but this did not prevent England finishing only third in their group and failing to progress to the finals of the competition.Miscellaneous informationNicknamesAlthough generally known as "Crouchie", other nicknames he has been given by fans and the media in England have included "RoboCrouch" and "Crouchinho" (a parody of Ronaldinho), despite "Crouchinho" translating from Portuguese as "little Crouch". He has been also referred to as "Mr. Roboto" by Univision's commentators and as "Pantera Rosa" ("Pink Panther") by Fox Sports en Español commentators. According to ITV4 show World Cuppa, he is also called "El Esparagus". Mark Lawrenson announced on Match of the Day that his nickname was "coathanger, apparently".Robotic dancingIn the summer of 2006, Crouch briefly became particularly celebrated in the English media for his unusual robotic dancing goal celebration. A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England team-mate David Beckham's house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on May 30. Two days after the match, Crouch repeated the dance at the request of Prince William during an England training session attended by the Prince. He again performed the dance, at the prompting of his team-mates, after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June. The dance was briefly a celebrated pop culture event, garnering much media coverage. The Daily Mirror newspaper claimed that the dance was inspired by the lyrics to the Arctic Monkeys' hit single "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor".On 12 June, Crouch announced he would only perform his robotic dance again if England were to win the World Cup, saying "It's not about robotic dancing. It is about scoring goals and winning matches. It's an important time for everyone now". In September 2006, he was quoted in The Observer newspaper as saying that: "It was funny at the time, but I didn't want to carry on doing it until it became unfunny. I've stopped doing it for the time being, but if I ever score a really big goal you never know." On 6 August 2007, Crouch insisted that he would never use the Robot dance again unless he scored in the UEFA Champions League Final.Statistics  |- |2000||IFK Hässleholm||||8||3||colspan="2"|-||colspan="2"|-||0||0||8||3  |- |2000-01||Queens Park Rangers||First Division||42||10||3||2||2||0||0||0||47||12 |- |2001-02||Portsmouth||First Division||37||18||1||0||1||1||0||0||39||19 |- |2001-02||rowspan="3"|Aston Villa||rowspan="3"|Premier League||7||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||2 |- |2002-03||14||0||0||0||0||0||4||0||18||0 |- |2003-04||16||4||0||0||2||0||0||0||18||4 |- |2003-04||Norwich City||First Division||15||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||15||4 |- |2004-05||Southampton||Premier League||27||12||5||4||1||0||0||0||33||16 |- |2005-06||rowspan="3"|Liverpool||rowspan="3"|Premier League||32||8||6||3||1||0||8||1||47||12 |- |2006-07||31||9||1||0||1||1||13||7||46||17 |- |2007-08||17||5||3||2||3||0||8||4||31||11 |- |2008-09||Portsmouth||Premier League||7||3 ||0||0||1||0||2||2||10||5 253||'78'||'19'||'11'||'12'||'2'||'35'||'14'||'319'||'105' |International goalsScores and results list England's goal tally first.#DateVenueOpponentScoreResultCompetition12006-03-01Liverpool, EnglandURU1-12-1Friendly match22006-05-30Manchester, EnglandHUN3-13-1Friendly match32006-06-03Manchester, EnglandJAM3-06-0Friendly match42006-06-03Manchester, EnglandJAM5-06-0Friendly match52006-06-03Manchester, EnglandJAM6-06-0Friendly match62006-06-15Frankfurt, GermanyTRI1-02-02006 FIFA World Cup72006-08-16Manchester, EnglandGRE3-04-0Friendly match82006-08-16Manchester, EnglandGRE4-04-0Friendly match92006-09-02Manchester, EnglandAND1-05-0UEFA Euro 2008 Qual.]]102006-09-02Manchester, EnglandAND5-05-0UEFA Euro 2008 Qual.]]112006-09-06Macedonia]]MKD1-01-0UEFA Euro 2008 Qual.]]122007-06-06Talinn, EstoniaEST2-03-0UEFA Euro 2008 Qual.]]132007-11-16Vienna, AustriaAUT1-01-0Friendly match142007-11-21London, EnglandCRO2-22-3UEFA Euro 2008 Qual.]]Career honoursNorwich2003–04 Football League First Division (Level 2)LiverpoolWinner2006 FA Cup2006 FA Community ShieldRunner Up2005 FIFA Club World Championship2007 UEFA Champions LeagueReferences and notesExternal linksOfficial Liverpool profilePeter Crouch Profile &amp; Statistics from Yahoo SportPeter Crouch Profile from CarlingCareer information at ex-canaries.co.uk      Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Macclesfield Category:English footballers Category:Football (soccer) strikers Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Tottenham Hotspur F.C. players Category:Dulwich Hamlet F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:England international footballers Category:England B international footballers Category:2006 FIFA World Cup playersar:بيتر كراوتش bn:পিটার ক্রাউচ bg:Питър Крауч ca:Peter Crouch cs:Peter Crouch da:Peter Crouch de:Peter Crouch et:Peter Crouch es:Peter Crouch fr:Peter Crouch ga:Peter Crouch ko:피터 크라우치 id:Peter Crouch it:Peter Crouch he:פיטר קראוץ' lt:Peter Crouch hu:Peter Crouch mr:पीटर क्राऊच ms:Peter Crouch nl:Peter Crouch ja:ピーター・クラウチ no:Peter Crouch pl:Peter Crouch pt:Peter Crouch ro:Peter Crouch ru:Крауч, Питер simple:Peter Crouch sk:Peter Crouch fi:Peter Crouch sv:Peter Crouch vi:Peter Crouch tr:Peter Crouch zh:彼得·克劳奇
