  Apoptygma Berzerk is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a unique brand of upbeat, danceable synthpop, and haunting ballads backed with electronic rhythms, winning awards and top-10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk (abbreviated to APB or Apop) has toured Europe, North America, and Israel with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton and Icon of Coil.The name "Apoptygma Berzerk" either has a secret meaning or does not mean anything, depending on which interview you read. Front-man and original member Stephan Groth claims that it was randomly picked out of a dictionary (apoptygma being an old Greek word meaning "piece of drapery"). The band's name is pronounced a-pop-'tig'-ma.The band was formed by Groth and Jon Erik Martinsen in 1989. They recorded a few demos, including Victims of Mutilation. Jon Erik left the band shortly afterwards feeling uncomfortable with the direction of the band's music.MembersStephan Groth (Grothesk) - front-man and original member, largely responsible for the "APB sound"Geir Bratland - KeyboardFredrik Brarud - DrumsAudun Stengel (Angel) - GuitarAnders Odden - Guitar (rejoined the band late 2003 after having left it some years before to pursue his own musical projects)Jon Erik Martensen - former member 1989-90s] & co-writer of some of HarmonizerPer Aksel Lundgreen - former member and live keyboardist 1991-1994 & co-writer of "Wrack'em To Pieces" and "Electronic Warfare". Also responsible for the bands booking and promotion from 1991-1994.StyleThe first two albums, Soli Deo Gloria and 7 were a similar style of electropop and EBM. Welcome to Earth included a few tracks that sound experimental, getting away from the band's roots slightly. Harmonizer featured a softer, more synthpop-oriented direction when compared to previous albums, and the latest album You and Me Against the World represents an almost complete change in style for the band. It features a more mainstream, Indie rock-oriented sound, and the complete departure from the band's traditional electric synthpop and EBM roots that started with 7.Many albums feature a hidden track that can be accessed by fast forwarding through many minutes of silence on the last album track. For instance, on 7'', one can hear a remix of ''Nonstop Violence after Love Never Dies (Part II).The band also features cover songs on several of their albums. For example, on 7'' a cover of OMD's "Electricity" is featured; similarly, on ''Welcome to Earth, the band has a cover of Metallica's &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. You and Me Against the World has a cover of "Cambodia" by Kim Wilde. They have also made a cover of Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence and Marilyn Manson's "Coma White".DiscographyDemosVictims Of Mutilation (Cassette) 1990 Slusk Records.
