It is known primarily as the birthplace of several Mafia bosses, both fictional and real.HistoryAfter the Arab conquest of southern Italy and during the Emirate of Sicily, the town was dominated by Arabs, who gave it the name Qurlayun. The Normans later achieved prominence after the Norman conquest of southern Italy.A lookout tower built between the 11th and 12th century, known as Saracena, still stands, in reference to the Arabs who were known as Saracens. The view from the tower includes the Cascata delle Due Rocche, a sheer drop following the path of the Corleone river.At one time the town was surrounded by defensive walls that connected the Castello Soprano and Castello Sottano. The Castello Sottano is better preserved than the Soprano, but it cannot be visited since it serves as a Franciscan retreat.Corleone was known as “Courageous Civitas” because of its position on the front line in all wars fought in Sicily. Halfway between Palermo and Agrigento, the town controlled one of the main arteries and was therefore one of the most strategic locations on the island.Corleone became a royal property around the end of the 14th century, and later passed into the feudal holdings of Federico Ventimiglia.Remarkable demographic growth was reported in the 15th and 16th centuries, following the arrival of several religious orders.In 1943, the Duke of Aosta created the title of Count of Corleone, awarded to Arturo Faini for his merits in the Italian occupation of Ethiopia.Main sightsThe Chiesa Madre (“Mother Church”), dedicated to St. Martin Bishop, was started in the late 14th century. Its appearance today has been influenced by numerous changes and renovations. Its interior has a nave and aisles divided into various chapels containing precious artwork, including a wooden statue representing San Filippo d’Agira from the 17th century, a statue representing San Biagio (16th century), and a fine marble panel depicting the Baptism of Christ from this same period.The Chiesa dell'Addolorata is a church of the 18th century, dedicated to the Basilian abbot and patron saint San Leoluca, the Chiesa di Santa Rosalia, and the small Sant’Andrea (the latter two from the 17th century), all with important frescoes and paintings, are notable landmarks. The Santuario della Madonna del Rosario di Tagliavia, a religious building from the 19th century, is now a destination for pilgrims on Ascension Day.Corleone todayBeginning in the 1960s, the town became famous for its Mafia, being the town in which some well-known clans had their headquarters (the Clan dei Corleonesi). Mafiosi born or taking up residence in Corleone have included Michele Navarra, Luciano Leggio, Leoluca Bagarella, Salvatore Riina and Bernardo Provenzano.The most notable event in Corleone was the arrest in 2006 of Bernardo Provenzano "Boss of Bosses", who had been in hiding for more than 40 years. This gave rise to much celebration. "Liberation Day" on April 11 (the date of Provenzano's capture) and naming a street "11 Aprile" shows just how much the arrest has affected Corleone.In literature and filmThe name of the town was used as the adopted surname of the title character in Mario Puzo's book and Francis Ford Coppola's film, The Godfather. In the novel, Vito Andolini emigrates from the village of Corleone. In the theatrical release of The Godfather, Part II, young Vito is assigned the Corleone surname while passing through immigration at Ellis Island. Many European immigrants passing through Ellis Island at that time had similar name alterations. Shy and unable to speak English, Vito is unable to respond when asked for his proper name, and is given the last name of Corleone by an immigration official. In the first and third movie of the series, various members of the Corleone family visit the town of Corleone.Coincidentally, the grandparents of Al Pacino (who played Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy of films), emigrated from Corleone, Sicily, in the same generation as Don Vito Corleone from the film.See alsoPeople from CorleoneMafia Members from Corleone by FamilyReferencesCategory:Municipalities of the Province of Palermobg:Корлеоне co:Curliuni de:Corleone et:Corleone el:Κορλεόνε es:Corleone eo:Corleone fr:Corleone hr:Corleone it:Corleone he:קורלאונה lt:Korleonė nl:Corleone ja:コルレオーネ nap:Corleone no:Corleone pl:Corleone pt:Corleone ro:Corleone scn:Cunigghiuni (PA) sr:Корлеоне fi:Corleone sv:Corleone (stad) tr:Corleone vo:Corleone
