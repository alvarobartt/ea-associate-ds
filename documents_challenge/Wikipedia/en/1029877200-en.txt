of Vibia Sabina.]]Vibia Sabina (c. 86-136 or 137) was a Roman Empress, wife and third cousin to Roman Emperor Hadrian. She was born about 86 AD to Salonina Matidia, niece of Roman Emperor Trajan and Lucius Vibius Sabinus, a man of consular rank. Sabina along with her grandmother, mother, her sister Matidia Minor and half sisters lived and were raised in the household of Trajan and his wife Pompeia Plotina.She married Hadrian in 100, at the Roman Empress Pompeia Plotina's request, for Hadrian to succeed her great uncle, in 117. Sabina's mother was also fond of Hadrian and allowed him to marry her daughter.They had no children and had an unhappy marriage. Sabina was said to have remarked that she had taken steps to see she never had children by Hadrian because they would "harm the human race". It seems that she once aborted a child of theirs. Sabina was strong and independent and her beliefs in marriage didn't sit well with the Emperor. Sabina had an affair with one of Hadrian's slave boys. In 128, she was awarded with the title of Augusta.She died in 136 or 137, before her husband, of unknown causes. There are rumours that Hadrian poisoned her, however there is not enough evidence to prove this.External links  Category:Roman empresses Sabina Category:2nd century Romans Category:86 births Category:130s deathsde:Vibia Sabina es:Vibia Sabina fr:Sabine (épouse d'Hadrien) it:Vibia Sabina mk:Вибија Сабина nl:Vibia Sabina pl:Vibia Sabina pt:Vibia Sabina sv:Vibia Sabina tr:Vibia Sabina
