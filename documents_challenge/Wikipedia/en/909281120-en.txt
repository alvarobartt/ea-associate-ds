 |variants with their own articles=The Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard (French for "battle standard") is a French carrier-borne strike fighter aircraft designed for service with the French Navy.Design and developmentThe Super Étandard is a development of the earlier Étendard IVM that was originally to have been replaced by a navalised version of the SEPECAT Jaguar, the Jaguar M, until this plan was stalled by political problems. The prototype first flew on 28 October 1974. The French Navy initially ordered 60 of the new model, which were delivered in June 1978 and the Argentinian Navy ordered 14. The Super Étendard had been developed in parallel with a new air-launched version of Aérospatiale's anti-shipping missile, the AM 39 Exocet, and these were supplied to Argentina as well.Operational historyFranceThe first operational missions took place in Lebanon during Operation Olifant. On 22 september 1983, French Navy bombed and destroyed Syrian forces positions after a few artillery rounds were fired at the French peace keepers. On 17 november 1983, the same airplanes attacked and destroyed a Hizbollah training camp in Baalbeck after a terrorist attack on French paratroopers in Beirut.From 1991, the original Étendard IVMs were withdrawn from French service, and the Super Étendards underwent continuous modernisation through the 1990s to enable them to use the latest generation of laser-guided precision weapons. These uprated aircraft, designated Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) participated in NATO's "Allied Force" operations over Kosovo in 1999, flying over 400 combat missions with 73% of the assigned objectives destroyed : the best performance of all the air forces involved in the missions over Kosovo. The SEM also flew strike missions in Operation Enduring Freedom.Operation Héraclès starting 21 november 2001 saw the deployment of the ''Charles de Gaulle'' and its Super Étendard in Afghanistan. Operation Anaconda, starting on 2 march 2002 saw extensive use of the Super Étendard in support of French and allied ground troops. Super Étendard's returned to operations over Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. One of their main roles was to carry laser designation pods to illuminate targets for Dassault Rafales.All Super Étendards are expected to be retired from French service by 2010, to be replaced from 2006 onwards with Dassault's Rafale M.[[Image:040617-N-8213G-154.jpg|thumb|left|Argentine Navy Super Étendard commencing touch and go landing aboard [[USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76)|USS Ronald Reagan]] aircraft carrier.]]ArgentinaThe Argentine Navy decided to buy 14 Super Étendards in 1980, after the United States put an arms embargo in place &mdash; due to the Dirty War &mdash; and refused to supply spare parts for their A-4Q Skyhawks. Argentine pilots utilised French flight trainers between November 1980 and August 1981 in France, but at the time of the Falklands War, they had received only 45 hours of actual flight time in the aircraft.USMC: Offensive Air Operations of The Falklands War Between August and November 1981, five Super Étendards and five Exocets were shipped to Argentina. All five of the missiles were used during the conflict, with one missile destroying [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS Sheffield]] and one the merchant aircraft transporter ''Atlantic Conveyor''. Two missiles were used in each of those attacks. The fifth missile was launched in an attack intended to strike against the aircraft carrier [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS Invincible]] but the attacking aircraft failed to find their target. (A sixth Exocet, which damaged [[HMS Glamorgan (D19)|HMS Glamorgan]], was a land-launched ship's missile, set up in an improvised truck-trailer platform by Argentine technicians.An interview with CL (R) Ing. Julio Pérez, chief designer of Exocet truck-based launcher)IraqFive Super Étendards were loaned to Iraq in 1983 while the country waited on deliveries of the Dassault Mirage F1s that had been ordered. These aircraft used Exocets with some success against Iranian tankers, 51 attacks in total in the Persian Gulf before being returned to France in 1985. At least two were shot down during the spring and summer of 1984 by Iranian F-14s, while Iran claims to have shot down a third one. Of the two aircraft destroyed one was indeed shot down, the other was only damaged but crashed whilst trying to return to base. Only three aircraft were returned to France.Operators's Super Étendard]]:Argentine Navy - 14 (2 in service)French Navy Aviation Navale - 60 (to be replaced by Rafale M)Iraqi Air Force - 5 (1983 - 1985)Specifications&lt;!-- (which variant ?) --&gt;See alsoReferences and  tags and the tag below -- External links Category:French fighter aircraft 1970-1979 Super Étendard Category:Falklands War aircraftde:Dassault Super Étendard es:Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard fr:Dassault Super-Étendard gl:Dassault Super Étendard it:Dassault Super Étendard hu:Super Étendard nl:Dassault Super-Étendard ja:シュペルエタンダール no:Dassault Super Étendard pl:Dassault Super Étendard pt:Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard ro:Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard ru:Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard fi:Dassault Super Étendard sv:Dassault Super-Étendard th:ดัซโซลท์-เบร์เกต์ ซูเปอร์ เอตังดาร์ท vi:Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard
