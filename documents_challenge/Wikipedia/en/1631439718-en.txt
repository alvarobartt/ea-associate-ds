The island was formed as a volcano 1.5 to 2.5 million years ago, the result of a geologic hotspot in the mantle under the oceanic plate that formed the whole of the Society Archipelago. It is theorized that the current bays were formerly river basins that filled during the Holocene searise.HistoryCharles Darwin was inspired for his theory regarding the formation of coral atolls when looking down upon Moorea standing on a peak on Tahiti. He described it as a "picture in a frame," referring to the barrier reef encircling the island.Don the Beachcomber lived here for some time until his houseboat was destroyed by tropical cyclones.Research facilitiesThe University of California, Berkeley maintains the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station on the west coast of Cook's Bay. The Gump station is also home to the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research Site (MCR LTER). The project, funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), is a partnership between the University of California Santa Barbara and California State University, Northridge that includes additional researchers from UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Diego and the University of Hawaii. The Moorea Coral Reef LTER is part of the National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network. The LTER Program was established by the NSF in 1980 to support research on long-term ecological phenomena. The Moorea Coral Reef LTER became the 26th site in the LTER network in September 2004.See alsoList of volcanoes in French PolynesiaSociety IslandsWindward Islands (Society Islands)==References== External linksOfficial site (Tahiti Tourisme Board)Moorea Travel InformationMap of MooreaDirectory: direct links about MooreaPhotogallery of MooreaMoorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research SiteU.C.
