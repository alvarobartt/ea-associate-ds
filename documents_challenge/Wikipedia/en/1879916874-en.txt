  | place of death =Rome | place of burial = | Flavius Iulius Popilius Nepotianus Constantinus (died 30 June 350), commonly Nepotian, was a member of the Constantinian dynasty, and a short-lived usurper of the Roman Empire. He ruled the city of Rome for twenty-eight days, before being killed by his rival usurper Magnentius' general Marcellinus.BackgroundNepotianus was the son of Eutropia, half-sister of Emperor Constantine I, and of Virius Nepotianus. On his mother's side, he was the grandson of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and Flavia Maximiana Theodora.EventsAfter the revolt of Magnentius, Nepotianus proclaimed himself "emperor" and entered Rome with a band of gladiators on 3 June 350. After attempting to resist Nepotianus with an undisciplined force of Roman citizens, the defeated Praefectus urbi Titianus (or Anicius, or Anicetus), a supporter of Magnentius, fled the city.Magnentius quickly dealt with this revolt by sending his trusted magister officiorum Marcellinus to Rome. According to Eutropius, Nepotianus was killed in the resulting struggle (on 30 June), his head put on a lance and brought around the city. In the following days, his mother Eutropia was also killed, during the persecution of the supporters of Nepotianus, most of whom were senators.References[http://www.roman-emperors.org/nepot.htm DiMaio, Michael, "Nepotian (350 A.D.)", DIR]Aurelius Victor De Caesaribus 42.6, Epitome 42.3Eutropius x.11Zosimus, ii.59Category:4th century Roman usurpers Category:Constantinian dynasty Category:Roman urban prefects Category:Year of birth missing Category:350 deathsbg:Непоциан de:Nepotianus es:Nepociano fr:Népotien it:Nepoziano mr:नेपोटियानस nl:Nepotianus pl:Nepocjan sr:Непоцијан tr:Nepotianus
