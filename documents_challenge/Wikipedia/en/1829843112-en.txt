"Qazaq" was included in a 13th century Turkic-Arabic dictionary, where its meaning was given as "independent" or "free".. Both Kazaks and later Cossacks adopted Turkic social term "qazaq" as their name. The Kazakhs began using this name during either the 15th or 16th century.Barthol'd, Vasiliĭ Vladimirovich. Four Studies on the History of Central Asia, vol. 3, trans. V. and T. Minorsky. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962, p. 129In the 19th century, one etymological theory presented was that the name came from the Kazakh legend of the white goose (Qaz means goose, Aq means white).Grodekov, Nikolaĭ Ivanovich. Kirgizy i Karakirgizy Syr'-darinskoi oblasti, vol. 1, Iuridicheskii byt' '' Tashkent, 1889, p. 1 In this creation myth, a white goose flying over the great steppes was impregnated by the rays of the Sun, giving birth to the first Kazak.Humphreys, An. ''Central Asia (Lonely Planet Guide) Sydney:Lonely Planet Publications, 2004, ISBN 978-0864426734 This version was rejected by linguists, because in Turkic languages, an adjective is put before a noun, therefore, "white goose" would be Aqqaz, not Qazaq. Another of the theories on the origin of the word "Kazakh" (originally "Qazaq") is that it comes from the ancient Turkic word "qazğaq", first mentioned on the 8th century Turkic monument of Uyuk-Turan. According to the notable Turkic linguist Vasily Radlov and the orientalist Veniamin Yudin, the noun "qazğaq" derives from the same root as the verb "qazğan" ("to obtain", "to gain"). Therefore, "qazğaq" defines a type of person that seeks profit and gain.Yudin, Veniamin P. Tsentralnaya Aziya v 14-18 vekah glazami vostokoveda.

Fair to light-brown skin tends to be the norm. Among physical traits are aquiline noses, epicanthic fold and high cheekbones. Hair colour among Kazakhs varies from prevalent jet black to red and sandy brown. Hazel, green and blue eyes are not uncommon.Many are also skilled in the performance of Kazakh traditional songs. One of the most commonly used traditional musical instruments of the Kazakhs is the dombra, a plucked lute with two strings. It is often used to accompany solo or group singing. Another popular instrument is kobyz, a bow instrument played on the knees. Along with other instruments, these two instruments play a key role in the traditional Kazakh orchestra. A famous composer is Kurmangazy, who lived in the 19th century. A famous singer of the Soviet epoch is Roza Rymbaeva, she was a star of the trans-Soviet-Union scale. A famous Kazakh rock band is Urker, performing in the genre of ethno-rock, which synthesises rock music with the traditional Kazakh music.Languages in performing songs]] The Kazakh language is a member of the Turkic language family, as are Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Uyghur, Turkish, Azeri, Turkmen, and many other living and historical languages spoken in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Xinjiang, and Siberia.Kazakh belongs to the Kipchak (Northwestern) group of the Turkic language family. Kazakh is characterized, in distinction to other Turkic languages, by the presence of  in place of reconstructed proto-Turkic * and  in place of *; furthermore, Kazakh has  (alveodental affricate) where other Turkic languages have  (glide).Kazakh, like most of the Turkic language family lacks phonemic vowel length, and as such there is no distinction between long and short vowels.Kazakh was written with the Arabic script during the 19th century, when a number of poets, educated in Islamic schools, incited revolt against Russia. Russia's response was to set up secular schools and devise a way of writing Kazakh with the Cyrillic alphabet, which was not widely accepted. By 1917, the Arabic script was reintroduced, even in schools and local government.In 1927, a Kazakh nationalist movement sprang up but was soon suppressed. At the same time the Arabic script was banned and the Latin alphabet was imposed for writing Kazakh. The Latin alphabet was in turn replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1940.Kazakh is one of the principal languages spoken in Kazakhstan, along with Russian. It is also spoken in the Ili region of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China, where the Arabic script is used, and in parts of Mongolia.Kazakh tribalism[[Image:Жуз.svg|thumb|250 px|left|Approximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh jüz in the early 20th century.1897 %1911 %1926 %1939 %1959 %1970 %1979 %1989 %1999 %2006 %73.960.859.538.030.032.636.039.753.459.2Kazakh minoritiesIn China Kazakhs, called Hāsàkè Zú in Chinese (哈萨克族; literally "Kazakh people" or "Kazakh nationality") are among 56 minority groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. In China there is one Kazakh autonomous prefecture, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, three Kazakh autonomous counties, Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County in Gansu, Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County and Mori Kazakh Autonomous County in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Many Kazakhs in China are not fluent in Standard Mandarin, China's official language, instead speaking the Kazakh language.Since the early 21st century, Mamuer Rayeskan, a young Kazakh musician from Qitai, Xinjiang now living in Beijing, has achieved some renown for his reworking of Kazakh folk songs with his group IZ, with which he sings and plays acoustic guitar, dombra, and Jew's harp.In RussiaIn Russia, the Kazakh population lives in the regions bordering Kazakhstan. The 2002 Russian census recorded 655,000 Kazakhs living in the Astrakhan, Volgograd, Samara, Orenburg, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, Omsk, Novosibirsk and Altai Krai regions. Since they, their ancestors, and other Turkic peoples populated these areas long before Russian colonisation, Russian Kazakhs are irredenta. During the 1920s, however, significant numbers of Kazakh families were left outside the designated Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic; after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, they acquired Russian citizenship.Other countriesMongolia: Majority of Kazakhs live in Bayan-Ölgiy Province. The Kazakh folk music is well known and loved in Mongolia. Most of Mongolian Kazakhs belong to "Middle juz" (Orta juz), the largest among three juzes.Uzbekistan: Significant Kazakh population lives in Karakalpakstan and Tashkent oblast. Since the fall of Soviet Union, vast majority of Kazakh people are returning to Kazakhstan, mainly to Manghistau Oblast'. Most Kazakhs in Karakalpakstan are descendants of one of the branches of "Junior juz" (Kişi juz)-Adai tribe.Iran: Iranian Kazakhs live mainly in the Golestan province in northern Iran. گلستان&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; According to ethnologue.org, in 1982 there were 3000 Kazakhs living in the city of Gorgan.Ethnologue report for Iran&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;http://www.golestanstate.ir/layers.aspx?quiz=page&amp;PageID=23&lt;/ref&gt; Since fall of Soviet Union number of Kazakhs in Iran decreased due to emigration to their historical Motherland."قزاق&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;See alsoList of Kazakh historical figuresDemographics of KazakhstanNotes and referencesExternal linksKazakh Language Courseware from University of Arizona Critical Languages SeriesEthnographic map of KazakhstanKazakhs in France - AKFTWorld Association of the Kazakhshttp://sana.gov.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=342Massagan.com (The largest web site in kazakh language)Suhbat (Atameken Toby)Secrets of the Dead: Amazon Warrior Women (PBS)[http://www.orientalistica.ru/resour/runica/collection/e3a.htm Turk monument of Uyuk-Turan mentioning the word "qazğaq"]   Category:Kazakhstani people Category:Turkic peoples Category:Ethnic groups in China Category:Ethnic groups in Russia Category:Ethnic groups in Kazakhstan Category:Ethnic groups in Kyrgyzstan Category:Ethnic groups in Mongolia Category:Ethnic groups in Tajikistan Category:Ethnic groups in Turkmenistan Category:Ethnic groups in Uzbekistan Category:Muslim communitiesbg:Казахи ca:Kazakhs cv:Казахсем cs:Kazaši de:Kasachen es:Kazajo (etnia) eo:Kazaĥoj fa:قزاق‌ها fr:Kazakhs ko:카자흐족 it:Kazaki ka:ყაზახები kk:Қазақтар ky:Казактар lt:Kazachai mk:Казаси nl:Kazachen ja:カザフ no:Kasaker pl:Kazachowie pt:Cazaques ro:Cazaşi ru:Казахи sr:Казаси sh:Kazasi fi:Kazakit sv:Kazaker vi:Người Kazakhs tr:Kazak Türkleri uk:Казахи zh:哈薩克族
