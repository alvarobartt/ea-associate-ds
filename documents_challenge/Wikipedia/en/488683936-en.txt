For other uses of the term, see inner circle.  Inner Circle is a Jamaican reggae group. The group was formed in 1968 by the brothers Ian and Roger Lewis in Jamaica. They are responsible for the 1989 song "Bad Boys," which serves as the theme song for Fox Network's long-running television program COPS. However, at first they covered soul and R&amp;B hits from the United States, and then also a few reggae songs, predominantly from Bob Marley.CareerThe band released its debut album in 1974 on the famed record label, Trojan Records, and resigned in 1979 to Island Records, where the internationally successful album Everything Is Great originated. This album reached top 20 in the UK and preceded their other chart success by some years.The original Inner Circle included Ibo Cooper (keyboards), Stephen Cat Core (guitar), Funky Brown (vocals), Prilly (vocals), Ian and Roger Lewis, and Mr. Lewis. The band's residence was originally on Holborn Road in New Kingston. In latter years they had a horn section that included Douglas Gutherie on alto sax and Leighton Johnson on trumpet; both were former members of the Excelsior High School band. During that time the band toured extensively to North America and Bermuda. At the end of this time, Ibo and Cat started their own band, Third World, whose hits included, "Now That We Found Love" and "Ninety Six Degrees in the Shade". Ibo, Cat, and Funky Brown were at this time students of the University of the West Indies studying for various degrees.The band were joined by New York Session guitarist 'Joe Ortiz' (http://www.heaven-on-earth-cds.com) dubbed by the band as GITZY who added the first touches of hard rock, jazz, and blues to the group. Joe recorded at Compass Point Studios for the Eveything Is Great Album on Island Records and later joined the group for their European Tour in 1978-1980. Joe also played on the title track for the album New Age Music. Wherever you find a greatest hits album, Joe will most likely feature - particularly on the live recordings which were made during the UK leg of the European tour.Jacob Miller, the frontman and lead singer, was killed in a car crash on March 23, 1980. The band appeared in the reggae cult film Rockers in 1978.After the loss of Jacob Miller, Inner Circle broke up, but in 1982 the band released another album called Something So Good. In 1986 Ian and Roger Lewis re-established Inner Circle with the singer Calton Coffie, and the band experienced a comeback with the album Black Roses.In 1987, Inner Circle released the song "Bad Boys." Since then, the band calls itself "The Bad Boys of Reggae". They had another big hit with the 1993 song "Sweat (A La La La La Long)", which was a #3 hit in the UK while "Bad Boys" had languished at #52. It was their second (and last) American hit, reaching #16 on the Billboard Hot 100.The lead singer Calton Coffie was ill for a long period in 1995 and decided after his recuperation to start a solo career. The current singer Kris Bentley took his place.Today, members of the group run Circle House, one of the most popular and respected recording studios in Miami.Present day band members and FamiliesInner Circle currently consists of the following five members:Ian Lewis (born 1 November 1956 / Bass guitar, vocals) Wife: Antoinette Lewis Children: Kahli Lewis, Gamal Lewis, Abebe LewisJr. Jazz (Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar)Bernard (Touter) Harvey (born 25 October 1955 / Keyboards, vocals) Children: Adrian Harvey, Alyssa HarveyLancelot Hall (born 7 February 1960 / Drums, percussion, vocals)Roger Lewis (born 29 June 1956 / Guitar, vocals)Children: Sherane LewisDiscographyStudio albums1974 Rock The Boat1975 Blame It To The Sun1976 Reggae Thing1977 Ready For The World1978 Heavyweight Dub1978 Killer Dub1979 Everything Is Great1980 New Age Music (final album with Jacob Miller)1982 Something So Good1986 Black Roses1987 One Way1990 Rewind!, Pt.2: The Singers1991 Identified1992 Bad To The Bone1994 Bad Boys1994 Reggae Dancer (final album with Calton Coffie)1996 Da Bomb1998 Speak My Language1999 Jamaika Me Crazy2000 Big Tings2001 Jah Jah People2001 Barefoot In Negril2004 This Is Crucial Reggae2008 ''State Of Da World ''Live album1999 Forward Jah-Jah People (Highlights from the ninth Cartagena Festival 1990)SinglesYearSongU.S. Hot 100]]U.S. R&B]]UK Singles]]Album1979"Everything Is Great"--37Everything Is Great"Stop Breaking My Heart"--501987Bad Boys]]"85852Bad Boys1992"Sweat (A La La La La Long)"167331993"Rock With You"98--1994]]Games People Play]]"84-67Reggae Dancer1998]]"Not About Romance"92--Speak My Languagede:Inner Circle es:Inner Circle (banda) fr:Inner Circle hu:Inner Circle nl:Inner Circle ja:インナー・サークル (バンド) pl:Inner Circle fi:Inner Circle sv:Inner Circle Category:Musical groups established in 1968 Category:Reggae musical groups
