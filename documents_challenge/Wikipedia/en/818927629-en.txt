Zealand is connected to Funen by the Great Belt Bridge and to Sweden by the Oresund Bridge.The capital of Denmark, Copenhagen, is partly located on the eastern shore of Zealand and partly on Amager. Other cities on the island include Roskilde and Elsinore.Mythological Originscarving Zealand from Sweden.]] In Norse mythology, the island was created by the goddess Gefjun after she tricked Gylfi, the king of Sweden, as told in the story of Gylfaginning. She removed a piece of land and transported it to Denmark, and it became the island of Zealand. The vacant area was filled with water and became Mälaren.Den Store Danske Encyklopædi, article Gefion However, since modern maps show a similarity between Zealand and the Swedish lake Vänern, it is sometimes identified as the hole left by Gefjun.GeographyOn June 5, 2007, the regional subsidiary of national broadcaster Danmarks Radio reported that a hill, Kobanke, situated in the southeast near the town Rønnede in Faxe municipality, with a natural point of terrain at 122.9 m (403.21 feet), was the highest natural point on Zealand. Gyldenløveshøj, south of the city Roskilde has a height of 126 m (413.4 feet), but that is due to a man-made hill from the 1600s and its highest natural point is only 121.3 m (397.96 feet).Cities, towns and villagesAllerødBallerupBirkerødCopenhagen (København)EgebjergElsinore (Helsingør)EspergærdeFrederiksbergFrederikssundFrederiksværkHaslevHelsingeHillerødHolbækHundestedHumlebækKalundborgKokkedalKongens LyngbyKøgeNykøbing SjællandNæstvedPræstøRingstedRoskildeRørvigSkovlundeSlagelseSlangerupSolrødSorøTisvildeVallensbækVordingborgÅlsgårdeReferencesCategory:Geography of Copenhagen Category:Islands of Denmarkbs:Zeland bg:Шеланд ca:Sjælland cs:Sjælland da:Sjælland de:Seeland (Dänemark) et:Sjælland es:Selandia eo:Sjælland eu:Sjaelland fr:Seeland (Danemark) gl:Selandia ko:셸란 섬 hr:Zeland id:Sjælland is:Sjáland it:Zelanda (isola) lt:Zelandija hu:Sjælland nl:Seeland ja:シェラン島 no:Sjælland nn:Sjælland pl:Zelandia (wyspa) pt:Zelândia (Dinamarca) ro:Zealand ru:Зеландия (остров) simple:Zealand fi:Själlanti sv:Själland vi:Zealand tr:Sjaelland uk:Зеландія (острів) zh:西兰岛
