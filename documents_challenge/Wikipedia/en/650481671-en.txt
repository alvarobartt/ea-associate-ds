  The whirligig beetles are a family (Gyrinidae) of water beetles that normally live on the surface of the water. They get their common name from their habit of swimming rapidly in circles when alarmed, and are also notable for their divided eyes which can see both above and below water.They are also known for their grouping behavior, a survival mechanism which helps them to avoid predation. Their places in the group are thought to be determined by a number of factors, including hunger, sex, species, water temperature, age, parasite level and stress level. Research being done on their behavior serves as a model to study the significance of chemical defense in relation to their position in the group, which relates to such fields as nanotechnology.They have a bubble of air trapped underneath their abdomens which allows them to dive and swim under the water for a long time. They bite and their bites cause a localised allergic reaction in susceptible individuals.
