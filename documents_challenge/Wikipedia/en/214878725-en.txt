With a height of  above sea level, it is the highest mountain in Australia (not including its external territories). It was named by the Polish explorer Count Paul Edmund Strzelecki in 1840, in honour of the Polish national hero General Tadeusz Kościuszko, because of its perceived resemblance to the Kościuszko Mound in Krakow.Australian Geographical Name DerivationsThe name of the mountain was formerly spelled "Mount Kosciusko," an Anglicisation; but the version "Mount Kosciuszko" was officially adopted in 1997 by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales. The common Australian pronunciation of Kosciuszko,  "kozzy-OS-ko", differs from the pronunciation in Polish,  "kosh-CHOOSH-ko".Various measurements of the peak originally called by that name showed it to be slightly lower than its neighbour, Mount Townsend, and the names were thereupon transposed by the New South Wales Lands Department, so that Mount Kosciuszko still remains the name of the highest peak of Australia, and Mount Townsend ranks as second. The 1863 picture by Eugene von Guerard hanging in the National Gallery of Australia titled "Northeast view from the northern top of Mount Kosciusko" is actually from Mt Townsend.Reaching the summitLike many of Australia's highest peaks, Mount Kosciuszko is not particularly difficult to climb. There is a road to Charlotte Pass, from which it is a nine kilometre walk up a path to the summit. Anybody with a modest level of fitness should be able to climb it. Until 1976 it was possible to drive to Rawson's Pass close to the summit. The walking track to Mount Kosciuszko from Charlotte Pass is in fact that road, which was closed to public motor vehicle access due to environmental concerns. This track is also used by cyclists as far as Rawson's Pass, where they must leave their bicycles if they continue to the summit.The peak may also be approached from Thredbo, which is a shorter (6.5 kilometres) and not very difficult walk and is supported by a chairlift ride year round. From the top of the chairlift there is a raised mesh walkway to the summit to protect the native vegetation and prevent erosion. Both tracks meet at Rawson's Pass for the final climb to the Kosciuszko summit. Australia's highest public toilet was built in 2007 at Rawson's Pass at an altitude of 2100 metres as over 100,000 people are now visiting the mountain each summer with human waste management becoming a serious issue.&lt;/ref&gt; The peak and the surrounding areas are snow-covered in winter and spring (usually beginning in June and continuing until October or later). The road from Charlotte Pass and the track from Thredbo are marked by snowpoles and provide a guide for cross-country skiers.Higher peaks exist within territory administered or claimed by Australia but outside the Australian mainland:Mawson Peak (2745 m.) on Heard IslandDome Argus (4030 m.), Mount McClintock (3490 m.) and Mount Menzies (3355 m.) in the Australian Antarctic Territory.Gallery Image:Kosciuszko01.JPG|Mount Kosciuszko from south side Image:Kosciuszko06.JPG|Mount Kosciuszko from north side Image:Kosciuszko05.JPG|East side of the mountain Image:Kosciuszko02.JPG|The plate of the top Image:Kosciuszko04.JPG|The monument of the top Image:Kosciuszko03.JPG|Lake Coopatamba, the lake on the highest place in the Australian continent Image:Kosciusko06.JPG|A view of Mount Kosciuszko Image:Thredbo.JPG|Thredbo from the mountain Notes and referencesSee alsoMount TownsendExternal linksMt.
