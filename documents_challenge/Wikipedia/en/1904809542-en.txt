Curzio Malaparte (June 9, 1898 - July 19, 1957), born Kurt Erich Suckert, was an Italian journalist, dramatist, short-story writer, novelist and diplomat. His chosen surname, which he used since 1925, means "he of the bad place" and is a pun on the word "Bonaparte".BiographyBorn in Prato, Tuscany, to a Lombard mother and a German father, he was educated at Collegio Cicognini and at the La Sapienza University of Rome. In 1918 he started his career as a journalist.Malaparte fought in World War I, earning a captaincy in the Fifth Alpine Regiment and several decorations for valor, and in 1922 took part in Benito Mussolini's March on Rome. In 1924, he founded the Roman periodical La Conquista dello stato ("The Conquest of the State", a title which would inspire Ramiro Ledesma Ramos' La Conquista del Estado). As a member of the Partito Nazionale Fascista, he founded several periodicals and contributed essays and articles to others, as well as writing numerous books, starting from the early 1920s, and directing two metropolitan newspapers.In 1926 he founded with Massimo Bontempelli (1878-1960) the literary quarterly 900. Later he became a co-editor of Fiera Letteraria (1928-31), and an editor of La Stampa in Turin. His confessional war novel, La rivolta dei santi (1921), criticized corrupt Rome as the real enemy. In Tecnica del colpo di Stato (1931) Malaparte attacked both Adolf Hitler and Mussolini. This led to Malaparte being stripped of his National Fascist Party membership and sent to internal exile from 1933 to 1938 on the island of Lipari.He was freed on the personal intervention of Mussolini's son-in-law and heir apparent Galeazzo Ciano. Mussolini's regime arrested Malaparte again in 1938, 1939, 1941, and 1943 and imprisoned him in Rome's infamous jail - Regina Coeli.Shortly after his time in jail he published books of magical realist autobiographical short stories, which culminated in the stylistic prose of Donna Come Me (Woman Like Me) (1940).His remarkable knowledge of Europe and its leaders is based upon his experience as a correspondent and in the Italian diplomatic service. In 1941 he was sent to cover the Eastern Front as a correspondent for Corriere della Sera. The articles he sent back from the Ukrainian Fronts, many of which were suppressed, were collected in 1943 and brought out under the title Il Volga nasce in Europa ("The Volga Rises in Europe"). Also, this experience provided the basis for his two most famous books, Kaputt (1944) and The Skin (1949).Kaputt, his novelistic account of the war, surreptitiously written, presents the conflict from the point of view of those doomed to lose it. Malaparte's account is marked by lyrical observations, as when he encounters a detachment of Wehrmacht soldiers fleeing a Ukrainian battlefield: When Germans become afraid, when that mysterious German fear begins to creep into their bones, they always arouse a special horror and pity. Their appearance is miserable, their cruelty sad, their courage silent and hopeless.According to D. Moore's editorial note, in The Skin: Malaparte extends the great fresco of European society he began in Kaputt. There the scene was Eastern Europe, here it is Italy during the years from 1943 to 1945; instead of Germans, the invaders are the American armed forces. In all the literature that derives from the Second World War, there is no other book that so brilliantly or so woundingly present triumphant American innocence against the background of the European experience of destruction and moral collapse.The book was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church, and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.From November 1943 to March 1946 he was attached to the American High Command in Italy as an Italian Liaison Officer. Articles by Curzio Malaparte have appeared in many literary periodicals of note in France, the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States.After the war, Malaparte's political sympathies veered to the left, and he became member of the Italian Communist Party. In 1947 Malaparte settled in Paris and wrote dramas without much success. His play Du Côté de chez Proust was based on the life of Marcel Proust, and Das Kapital was a portrait of Karl Marx. Cristo Proibito ("Forbidden Christ") was Malaparte's moderately successful film - which he wrote, directed, and scored in 1950. It won the "City of Berlin" special prize at the Berlin Film Festival in 1951. In the story, a war veteran returns to his village to avenge the death of his brother, shot by the Germans. It was released in the United States in 1953 as Strange Deception and voted among the five best foreign films by National Board Of Review.He also produced the variety show Sexophone and planned to cross the United States on bicycle. Just before his death, Malaparte completed the treatment of another film, Il Compagno P. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Malaparte became interested in the Maoist version of Communism, but his journey to China was cut short by illness, and he was flown back to Rome. Io in Russia e in Cina, his journal of the events, was published posthumously in 1958. Malaparte's final book, Maledetti toscani, his attack on bourgeois culture, appeared in 1956. He died of cancer.Main writingsTecnica del colpo di Stato (1931)Donna Come Me (1940) translated as Woman Like Me, Troubador Italian Studies, 2006 ISBN 1-90523-784-7The Volga Rises in Europe (1943) ISBN 1-84158-096-1Kaputt (1944) ISBN 0-8101-1341-4La Pelle (1949) translated as The Skin ISBN 0-8101-1572-7Du Côté de chez Proust (1951)Maledetti toscani (1956) - translated as Those Cursed Tuscans, Ohio University Press, 1964Directed[http://www.immaginapienza.it/cinema/artecultura/cinema/Il_Cristo_Proibito/il_cristo_proibito.html The Forbidden Christ] (1950)See alsoCasa MalaparteReferencesMalaparte: A House Like Me by Michael McDonough, 1999, ISBN 0-609-60378-7)The Appeal of Fascism: A Study of Intellectuals and Fascism 1919-1945 by Alastair Hamilton (London, 1971, ISBN 0-218-51426-3)Kaputt by Curzio Malaparte, E.
