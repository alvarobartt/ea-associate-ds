 Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-103) is one of the three currently operational orbiters in the Space Shuttle fleet of NASA, the space agency of the United States. (The other two are Atlantis and Endeavour.) When first flown in 1984, Discovery became the third operational orbiter, and is now the oldest orbiter in service. Discovery has performed both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions.HistoryThe spacecraft takes its name from previous ships of exploration named Discovery, primarily [[HMS Discovery (1774)|HMS Discovery]], the sailing ship that accompanied famous explorer James Cook on his third and final major voyage. Others include Henry Hudson's ship Discovery which he used in 1610–1611 to search for a Northwest Passage, and [[RRS Discovery|RRS Discovery]], a vessel used for expeditions to Antarctica in 1901-1904 by Scott and Shackleton (and still preserved as a museum). The shuttle shares a name with Discovery One, the fictional Jupiter spaceship from the films 2001: A Space Odyssey and 2010.Discovery was the shuttle that launched the Hubble Space Telescope. The second and third Hubble service missions were also conducted by Discovery. She has also launched the Ulysses probe and three TDRS satellites. Discovery has been chosen twice as the return to flight orbiter, first in 1988 as the return to flight orbiter after the [[STS-51-L|1986 Challenger disaster]], and then for the twin return to flight missions in July 2005 and July 2006 after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|2003 Columbia disaster]]. Discovery also carried Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time, back into space during STS-95 on October 29, 1998, making him the oldest human being to venture into space.Had the planned missions from Vandenberg Air Force Base for the United States Department of Defense gone ahead, Discovery would have flown these missions.Current statusDiscovery is currently in the Orbiter Processing Facility for post-flight processing after the successful completion of STS-124. The next flight of Discovery will be STS-119. Rollover to the VAB is tentatively scheduled for January 5, 2009.FlightsDiscovery has flown 35 flights, spent 310,6 days in space, completed 4,888 orbits, and flown 117,433,618 miles (195,938,294 km) in total, as of June 2008. Discovery is the orbiter fleet leader, having flown more flights than any other orbiter in the fleet. Discovery flew all three "return to flight" missions after the ''Challenger'' and ''Columbia'' disasters: STS-26 in 1988, STS-114 in 2005, and STS-121 in 2006.STS-41-D: First flight.STS-51-D: Carried first sitting United States Member of Congress into space, Senator Jake Garn (R-UT).STS-26: Return to space after ''Challenger'' disaster (STS-51-L).STS-31: Launch of Hubble Space Telescope.STS-60: First Russian launched in an American spacecraft (Sergei Krikalev).STS-95: Second flight of John Glenn, oldest man in space and third sitting Member of Congress to enter space.STS-92: The 100th Space Shuttle Mission.STS-114: Return to space after ''Columbia'' disaster (STS-107).STS-121: First Shuttle launch on the 4th of July Holiday, Return to Flight mission.STS-116: First night time launch of a shuttle since the ''Columbia'' disaster. Last Shuttle launch from LC-39BSTS-120: Longest mission so far for this space shuttle.Flights listing#DateDesignationNotesLength of journey11984 August 30STS-41-DLEASAT F2]].6 days, 00 hours, 56 minutes, 04 seconds21984 November 8STS-51-ALaunched two and rescued two communications satellites including LEASAT F1.7 days, 23 hours, 44 minutes, 56 seconds31985 January 24STS-51-CDOD]] Magnum ELINT satellite.3 days, 01 hours, 33 minutes, 23 seconds41985 April 12STS-51-DLaunched two communications satellites including LEASAT F3.6 days, 23 hours, 55 minutes, 23 seconds51985 June 17STS-51-GSultan Salman al-Saud]] becomes first Saudi Arabian in space.7 days, 01 hours, 38 minutes, 52 seconds61985 August 27STS-51-ILaunched two communications satellites including LEASAT F4.

If the Contingency Logistic Flight STS-133 by Endeavour is not flown, Discovery will be the last space shuttle to fly on mission STS-132. NASA expects to launch the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle on the new Ares I rocket by 2014.Gallery Image:07042007 SpaceShuttle Discovery.jpg|STS-121 launches, the only Independence Day shuttle launch for NASA.
