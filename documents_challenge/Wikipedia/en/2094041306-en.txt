He was the son of John I of Portugal and his wife, Philippa of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt. His was named in honor of his great-grandfather, King Edward III of England.As an infante, Duarte always followed his father, King João I, in the affairs of the kingdom. He was knighted in 1415, after the Portuguese capture of the city of Ceuta in North Africa, across from Gibraltar. He became king in 1433 when his father died of the plague and he soon showed interest in internal consensus. During his short reign of five years, Duarte called the Cortes (the national assembly) no less than five times to discuss internal affairs and politics. He also followed the politics of his father concerning the maritime exploration of Africa. He encouraged and financed his famous brother, Henry the Navigator who founded a "school" of maritime navigation at Sagres and who initiated many expeditions. Among these, that of Gil Eanes in 1434 first rounded Cape Bojador on the northwestern coast of Africa, leading the way for further exploration southward along the African coast.The colony at Ceuta rapidly became a drain on the Portuguese treasury and it was realised that without the city of Tangier, possession of Ceuta was worthless. When Ceuta was lost to the Portuguese, the camel caravans that were part of the overland trade routes began to use Tangier as their new destination. This deprived Ceuta of the materials and goods that made it an attractive market and a vibrant trading locale, and it became an isolated community.In 1437, his brothers, Henry (Henrique) and Fernando, persuaded Duarte to launch an attack on Morocco in order to get a better African base for future Atlantic exploration. The expedition was not unanimously supported: Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra and Infante João were both against the initiative; they preferred to avoid conflict with the king of Morocco. They proved to be right. The resulting attack on Tangier was successful, but at a great cost of men. Duarte's youngest brother, Fernando, the Saint Prince was captured, kept as a hostage, and he died later in captivity in Fez. Duarte died soon after the Tangier attack of the plague, like his father and mother (and her mother) before him.Another less political side of Duarte's personality is related to culture. A reflective and scholarly infante, he wrote the treatises O Leal Conselheiro (The Loyal Counsellor) and ''Livro Da Ensinanca De Bem Cavalgar Toda Sela'' (The Art of Riding on Every Saddle) as well as several poems. He was in the process of revising the Portuguese law code when he died.Ancestors+'Duarte's ancestors in three generations'Duarte of PortugalFather:John I of PortugalFather's father:Peter I of PortugalFather's father's father:Afonso IV of PortugalFather's father's mother:Beatrice of CastileFather's mother:Teresa LourençoFather's mother's father:Lourenço MartinsFather's mother's mother:Sancha MartinsMother:Philippa of LancasterMother's father:John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of LancasterMother's father's father:Edward III of EnglandMother's father's mother:Philippa of HainaultMother's mother:Blanche of LancasterMother's mother's father:Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of LancasterMother's mother's mother:Isabel de BeaumontMarriages and descendantsDuarte married Eleanor of Aragon, a daughter of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Leonor Urraca of Castile, in 1428.NameBirthDeathNotesBy Eleanor of Aragon (Queen of Portugal) (c. 1402-February 19 1445); married on September 22 1428)Infante João (John)October 1429b.
