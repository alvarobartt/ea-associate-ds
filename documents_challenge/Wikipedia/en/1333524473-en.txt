The Sword-leaved Helleborine, Cephalanthera longifolia, is a terrestrial orchid found in much of western and southern Europe. It is common in some parts of its range, such as southern France and Spain, but endangered particularly in northern areas such as Belgium.The long, narrow tapering leaves give the plant its common name. The plant reaches a height of about 25 cm in typical conditions. The infloresence consists of 8-20 bell-shaped flowers of about 1cm in size, often not full open. It can be found in bloom from April to August, depending on location and altitude. It typically grows in damp woodland places.In the UK it is a declining species, and conservation work is being carried out at a number of sites to safegaurd it.In 2007 it was listed as a priority species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The charity Plantlife International is leading on this work in the UK.See alsoGalley Down WoodExternal linksDen virtuella floran - Distribution category:orchid species ca:Curraià blanc co:Cephalanthera longifolia de:Langblättriges Waldvöglein et:Valge tolmpea es:Cephalanthera longifolia fr:Céphalanthère à feuilles étroites hsb:Mječikojta ptačulinka it:Cephalanthera longifolia he:סחלבן החורש lt:Kardalapis garbenis hu:Kardos madársisak nl:Wit bosvogeltje no:Hvit skogfrue pl:Buławnik mieczolistny fi:Miekkavalkku
