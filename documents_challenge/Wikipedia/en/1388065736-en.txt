William Lassell (June 18 1799 &ndash; October 5 1880) was an English astronomer.Born in Bolton, he made his fortune as a beer brewer, which enabled him to indulge his interest in astronomy. He built an observatory near Liverpool with a  reflector telescope, for which he pioneered the use of an equatorial mount for easy tracking of objects as the earth rotates. He ground and polished the mirror himself, using equipment he constructed.In 1846 Lassell discovered Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself by German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. In 1848 he independently co-discovered Hyperion, a moon of Saturn. In 1851 he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, two new moons of Uranus.When Queen Victoria visited Liverpool in 1851, Lassell was the only local she specifically requested to meet.In 1855, he built a  telescope, which he installed in Malta because of the better observing conditions compared to England.He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1849, and served as its president for two years starting in 1870.Lassell died in Maidenhead in 1880. Upon his death, he left a fortune of £80,000 (equivalent to millions of American dollars by today's standards).Lassell crater on the Moon, a crater on Mars and a ring of Neptune are named in his honour.External linksBiography and other topicsShort biography and picturesObituaries[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/AN.../0098//0000108.000.html AN 98(1881) 108] (in German)[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=MNRAS&amp;year=%3F%3F%3F%3F&amp;volume=..41&amp;letter=.&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=189&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES MNRAS 41(1881) 188]Lassell, William Lassell, William Lassell, William Lassell, William Lassell, William Lassell, William Lassell Lassell, Williamcs:William Lassell cy:William Lassell da:William Lassell de:William Lassell el:Ουίλιαμ Λάσελ es:William Lassell fr:William Lassell ko:윌리엄 라셀 it:William Lassell la:Gulielmus Lassell lb:William Lassell nl:William Lassell ja:ウィリアム・ラッセル nds:William Lassell pl:William Lassell pt:William Lassell ru:Лассел, Уильям simple:William Lassell sk:William Lassell sl:William Lassell fi:William Lassell sv:William Lassell
