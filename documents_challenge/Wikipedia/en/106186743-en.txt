with north highlighted and at top]] This is about the direction; for other uses, see North (disambiguation).North is one of the four cardinal directions, specifically the direction that, in Western culture, is treated as the fundamental direction:North is used (explicitly or implicitly) to define all other directions.The (visual) top edges of maps usually correspond to the northern edge of the area represented, unless explicitly stated otherwise or landmarks are considered more useful for that territory than specific directions.Definitions North can mean:true north, the direction along the earth's surface toward one pole of the earth's rotation, namely the pole that is clearly on one's left when standing at the Equator while facing the rising sun.magnetic north, the direction along the earth's surface in which horizontal magnetic field strength has its most positive value (but the eventual next &quot;flipping&quot; of the magnetic poles, perhaps in a few thousand years, implies this awkward wording: "the north magnetic pole will later lie in the southern hemisphere".)a loosely specified direction, usually within half a right angle of true north, especially when stating travel instructions in an area where directions of travel are constrained by an approximately rectangular grid of streets, hallways, etc.; this is often called 'grid north' or 'plan north'.the orientation of a traveller with respect to a visible or otherwise definite continuous two-way route, such that sustained travel over the whole of the route produces a change of position to a location further north, even if that involves travelling a part of the route in another direction, even straight south; often termed "northbound".pertaining to the part of a route mainly or exclusively used by northbound traffic, where southbound traffic is separated by barriers, or where both are encouraged to stay mostly in one portion by Rules of the road; often termed "northbound".used euphemistically to refer to the direction of travel toward a goal, such as in football, the direction toward the opponents goal is north, and when players are moving crossways and not making progress toward the goal, they are said to be moving "east-west".EtymologyThe word north is traced to the Old High German nord, and the Proto-Indo-European unit ''ner-'', meaning "left" (or "under"). (Presumably a natural primitive description of its concept is "to the left of the rising sun".)Latin borealis is from Greek boreas "north wind, north", in mythology (according to Ovid) personified as the son of the river-god Strymon, and father of Calais and Zetes; septentrionalis is from septentriones, "the seven plow oxen", a name of Ursa Maior. Greek arktikos "northern" is named for the same constellation (c.f. Arctic).Other languages have sometimes more interesting derivations. For example, in Lezgian kefer can mean both 'disbelief' and 'north', since north of Muslim Lezgians there are areas inhabited by non-Muslim Slavic peoples. In many languages of Mesoamerica, 'north' means also 'up'.Magnetic north and declinationMagnetic north is of interest because it is the direction indicated as north on a properly functioning (but uncorrected) magnetic compass. The difference between it and true north is called the magnetic declination (or simply the declination where the context is clear). For many purposes and physical circumstances, the error in direction that results from ignoring the distinction is tolerable; in others a mental or instrument compensation, based on assumed knowledge of the applicable declination, can solve all the problems. But simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound, and as likely to reflect popular misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism.== Roles of north as prime direction == The visible rotation of the night sky about the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to up. Thus the choice of the north as corresponding to up in the northern hemisphere, or of south in that role in the southern, is, prior to world-wide communication, anything but an arbitrary one. On the contrary, it is of interest that Chinese culture even considered south as the proper top end for maps.In Western culture:Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the topGlobes of the earth have the North Pole at the top, or if the earth's axis is represented as inclined from vertical (normally by the angle it has relative to the axis of the earth's orbit), in the top half.Maps are usually labelled to indicate which direction on the map corresponds to a direction on the earth,usually with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north,occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively,occasionally with a compass rose, but if so, usually on a map with north at the top and usually with north decorated more prominently than any other compass point.Up is a metaphor for north. The notion that north should always be up and east at the right was established by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy. The historian Daniel Boorstin suggests that perhaps this was because the better-known places in his world were in the northern hemisphere, and on a flat map these were most convenient for study if they were in the upper right-hand corner.Roles of east and west as inherently subsidiary directionsWhile the choice of north over south as prime direction reflects quite arbitrary historical factors, east and west are not nearly as natural alternatives as first glance might suggest. Their folk definitions are, respectively, "where the sun rises" and "where it sets". Except on the Equator, however, these definitions, taken together, would imply thateast and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question, andthey would each move slightly from day to day and, in the temperate zones, markedly over the course of the year.Reasonably accurate folk astronomy, such as is usually attributed to Stone Age peoples or later Celts, would arrive at east and west by noting the directions of rising and setting (preferably more than once each) and choosing as prime direction one of the two mutually opposite directions that lie halfway between those two. The true folk-astronomical definitions of east and west are "the directions, a right angle from the prime direction, that are closest to the rising and setting, respectively, of the sun (or moon).==See also=="The North", a sense of the term that refers to the Northern part of the world, as contrasted to the SouthNordicityThe world's most northern bagpipe orchestra, city, capital, zoo etc.NordicismSeptentrionalismArcticCategory:Orientationaf:Noord als:Norden ar:شمال az:Şimal ba:Төньяҡ be:Поўнач be-x-old:Поўнач bs:Sjever br:Norzh bg:Север ca:Nord ceb:Amihanan cs:Sever co:Nordu da:Kompasretning#Nord de:Norden et:Põhi el:Βορράς myv:Пелеве ёнкс es:Norte eo:Nordo eu:Ipar fa:شمال fr:Nord fur:Nord gan:北 gl:Norte ko:북쪽 hi:उत्तर hr:Sjever id:Utara is:Norður it:Nord he:צפון pam:Pangulu sw:Kaskazini ku:Bakur la:Septentrio lt:Šiaurė ln:Nola lmo:Nòrd hu:Észak mr:उत्तर दिशा ms:Utara nl:Noord (windstreek) ne:उत्तर ja:北 no:Nord nn:Nord nrm:Nord oc:Nòrd pl:Północ pt:Norte ro:Nord qu:Chincha ru:Север simple:North sk:Sever (svetová strana) cu:Сѣверъ sl:Sever sr:Север sh:Sever fi:Pohjoinen sv:Norr ta:வடக்கு te:ఉత్తరం th:ทิศเหนือ vi:Hướng Bắc tr:Kuzey bug:Manorang uk:Північ vec:Nord wa:Bijhe (costé del Daegne) yi:צפון zh-yue:北 bat-smg:Šiaurė zh:北
