He was educated at the Technical University of Munich from 1925 to 1927 and then entered the Technical University of Berlin, where he posited that microscopes using electrons, with waves 1,000 shorter than those of light, could provide a more detailed picture of an object than a microscope utilizing light, in which magnification is limited by the size of the wavelengths. In 1931, he built an electron lens and used several of these in a series to build the first electron microscope in 1933.Ruska worked at Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG as a research engineer from 1937 to 1955 and then served as director of the Institute for Electron Microscopy of the Fritz Haber Institute from 1955 to 1972. Concurrently, Ruska served at the institute and as professor at the Technical University of Berlin, from 1957 until his retirement in 1972. In 1986, he won half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his many achievements in electron optics; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer won a quarter each for their design of the scanning tunneling microscope. He died in West Berlin in 1988.External linksErnst Ruska: Official Nobel pageHomepage of the Ruska family Category:1906 births Category:1988 deaths Ruska, Ernst Ruska, Ernst Ruska, Ernst Ruska, Ernst Category:Microscopistsbn:আর্নস্ট রুস্কা bg:Ернст Руска ca:Ernst Ruska cs:Ernst Ruska de:Ernst Ruska es:Ernst Ruska eo:Ernst Ruska fr:Ernst August Friedrich Ruska io:Ernst Ruska id:Ernst Ruska it:Ernst Ruska sw:Ernst Ruska ku:Ernst Ruska nl:Ernst Ruska ja:エルンスト・ルスカ oc:Ernst Ruska pl:Ernst Ruska pt:Ernst Ruska ro:Ernst Ruska ru:Руска, Эрнст Август sk:Ernst Ruska fi:Ernst Ruska sv:Ernst Ruska ta:ஏர்ணஸ்ட் ருஸ்கா tr:Ernst Ruska zh:恩斯特·鲁斯卡
