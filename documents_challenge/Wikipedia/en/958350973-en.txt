Orbit's remixes carry his signature electronic sounds and techniques, making them sought after by fans of his solo work.Orbit also produced a version of Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings" (the original arrangement of which features as the main theme of the soundtrack to Platoon). Adagio was lifted from the successful album Pieces in a Modern Style which was a compilation of classical re-workings. Orbit's version of the track was itself remixed in 1999 by Ferry Corsten and became a big club music hit as well as reaching #4 in the UK Singles Chart.He has worked with girl groups All Saints ("Pure Shores", "Black Coffee") and Sugababes and Pink ("Feel Good Time" from Charlie's Angels 2).

His remix is called "Electrical Storm (William Orbit Mix)." He has also worked with Swedish duo Roxette in the song "Entering Your Heart."He founded Guerilla Records in 1989.Orbit has also created several radio shows. In the late 1990s, he had a series on Los Angeles-based KCRW, called Stereo Odyssey.Orbit's song, "Time To Get Wise" was used in the 2004 film What the Bleep Do We Know!?, and the song's title was used as a tag line for the film.In 2005, Orbit's most recent album, Hello Waveforms was released on the Sanctuary label. Subsequently he produced two tracks — "Louise" and "Summertime" — for Robbie Williams' 2006 album, Rudebox. At this time, he also mixed several tracks on Laurie Mayer's most recent album, Black Lining.In the fall of 2006, "Purdy," a track Orbit co-composed with Laurie Mayer and Rico Conning, was used as the soundtrack in a television ad campaign for H&amp;M which starred Madonna and was directed by her and Dan Cadan.In 2007, Orbit composed his first orchestral suite for a full orchestra.
