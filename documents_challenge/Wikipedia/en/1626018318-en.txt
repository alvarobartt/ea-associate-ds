However, following the competition, Goldfever tested positive for the prohibited substance betamethasone. The International Equestrian Federation found Beerbaum guilty of breaking the rules, stripping both him and his German team of their medals, dropping Germany down to bronze. Beerbaum believed the substance to have been present in an ointment administered to the horse due to a skin irritation, and the FEI agreed that the substance provided no competitive advantage. However, in accordance to the rule, Beerbaum was disqualified.RecordOlympic GamesTeam Gold medal at the 1988 Olympic Games: 17.25 penalties (The Freak)Individual Gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games: 0 penalties (Classic Touch)Team Gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games: 1.75 penalties (Ratina Z)Team Gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games: 15 penalties (Goldfever)Disqualified, losing team gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games—''See "Doping Offense" above'' (Goldfever)World ChampionshipsBronze medal team, individually 5th place at the 2006 World Equestrian Games in Aachen, Germany (L'Espoir)4th place team, 22nd individually at the 2002 World Equestrian Games in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (Gladdys S)Gold medal team, 5th individually at the 1998 World Equestrian Games in Rome, Italy (Priamos)Gold medal team, 4th individually at the 1994 World Equestrian Games in The Hague, Netherlands (Ratina Z)Silver medal team, 73rd individually at the 1990 World Equestrian Games in Stockholm, Sweden (Gazelle)European ChampionshipsTeam Silver, Individual Bronze at the 2007 CH-EU in Mannheim, Germany (Goldfever 3)Team Gold, Individual Silver at the 2003 CH-EU in Donaueschingen, Germany (Goldfever 3)Team Bronze, Individual Gold at the 2001 CH-EU in Arnhem, Netherlands (Gladdys S)Team Gold, Individually 26th at the 1999 CH-EU in Hickstead, Britain (Champion du Lys)Team Gold, Individual Gold at the 1997 CH-EU in Mannheim, Germany (Ratina Z)Team 4th, Individually 29th at the 1993 CH-EU in Gijon, Spain (Rush On)Team 5th, Individually 21st at the 1991 CH-EU in La Baule, France (Grand Plaisir)Team 5th, Individually 23rd at the 1987 CH-EU in St. Gallen, Switzerland (Wiener Domspatz)Team Bronze, Individual Bronze at the 1984 CH-EU-Y in Cervia, Italy (Wittersfernde)World Cup Final12th place at the 2005 World Cup Final in Las Vegas, USA (Couleur Rubin)8th place at the 2003 World Cup Final in Las Vegas, USA (Goldfever 3)2nd place at the 2002 World Cup Final in Leipzig, Germany (Gladdys S)3rd place at the 1998 World Cup Final in Helsinki, Sweden (P.S.
