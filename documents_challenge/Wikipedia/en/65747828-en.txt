Engels also edited the second and third volumes of Das Kapital after Marx's death.BiographyEarly yearsFriedrich Engels was born in Barmen, Rhine Province of the kingdom of Prussia (now a part of Wuppertal in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) as the elder son of a German textile manufacturer, with whom he had a strained relationship.

The Marx-Engels Reader, p.xv During this time, Engels began reading the philosophy of Hegel, whose teachings had dominated German philosophy at the time. In September 1838, he published his first work, a poem titled The Bedouin, in the Bremisches Conversationsblatt No. 40. He also engaged in other literary and journalistic work.Preface by Progress Publishers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Footnotes to Volume 1 of Marx Engels Collected Works&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In 1841, Engels joined the Prussian Army as a member of the Household Artillery. This position moved him to Berlin where he attended university lectures, began to associate with groups of Young Hegelians and published several articles in the Rheinische Zeitung. Throughout his lifetime, Engels would point out that he was indebted to German philosophy because of its effect on his intellectual development.EnglandIn 1842, the 22-year-old Engels was sent to Manchester, England to work for the textile firm of Ermen and Engels in which his father was a shareholder.Biography on Engels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;BBC - Legacies - Work - England - Manchester - Engels in Manchester - Article Page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Engels' father thought working in at the Manchester firm might make Engels reconsider the radical learnings that he had developed in high school. On way to Manchester, Engels visited the office of the Rheinische Zeitung and met Karl Marx for the first time - though they did not impress each other. Wheen, Francis Karl Marx: A Life, p. 75  In Manchester, Engels met Mary Burns, a young woman with whom he began a relationship that lasted until her death in 1862.BBC - Legacies - Work - England - Manchester - Engels in Manchester - Article Page 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Mary acted as a guide through Manchester and helped introduce Engels to the English working class. The two maintained a lifelong relationship; they never married, as Engels was against the institution of marriage which he saw as unnatural and unjust.Origins of the Family&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;During his time in Manchester, Engels took notes and personally observed the horrible working conditions of English workers. These notes and observations, along with his experience working in his father's commercial firm, formed the basis for his first book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844. While writing it, Engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics. He frequented some members of the English labour and Chartist movements and wrote for several journals, including The Northern Star, Robert Owen’s New Moral World and the Democratic Review newspaperIntroduction to the French Edition of Engels' by Karl Marx 1880&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.ParisAfter a productive stay in England, Engels decided to return to Germany in 1844. On his way, he stopped in Paris to meet Karl Marx, with whom he had an earlier correspondence. Marx and Engels met at the Café de la Régence on the Place du Palais, 28 August 1844. The two became close friends and would remain so for their entire lives. Engels ended up staying in Paris to help Marx write The Holy Family, which was an attack on the Young Hegelians and the Bauer brothers. Engels' earliest contribution to Marx's work was writing to the Deutsch-französische Jahrbücher journal, which was edited by both Marx and Arnold Ruge in Paris in the same year.BrusselsFrom 1845 to 1848, Engels and Marx lived in Brussels, spending much of their time organizing the city's German workers. Shortly after their arrival, they contacted and joined the underground German Communist League and were commissioned by the League to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism. This became the The Manifesto of the Communist Party, better known as the Communist Manifesto. It was first published on 21 February 1848.Return to PrussiaDuring February 1848, there was a revolution in France that eventually spread to other Western European countries. This event caused Engels & Marx to go back to their home country of Prussia, specifically the city of Cologne. While living in Cologne, they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. However, during June 1849 Prussian coup d'état the newspaper was suppressed. After the coup, Marx lost his Prussian citizenship, was deported, and fled to Paris and then London. Engels stayed in Prussia and took part in an armed uprising in South Germany as an aide-de-camp in the volunteer corps of August Willich.Engels, Frederick (encyclopedia)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; When the uprising was crushed, Engels managed to escape by traveling through Switzerland as a refugee and returned to England.===Back in Manchester=== Once Engels made it to England, he decided to re-enter the commercial firm where his father held shares in order to help support Marx. He hated this work intensely but knew that his friend needed the support.BBC - Legacies - Work - England - Manchester - Engels in Manchester - Article Page 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;BBC - Legacies - Work - England - Manchester - Engels in Manchester - Article Page 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; He started off as an office clerk, the same position he held in his teens, but eventually worked his way up to become a joint proprietor in 1864. Five years later, Engels retired from the business to focus more on his studies. At this time, Marx was living in London but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence. In 1870, Engels moved to London where he and Marx lived until Marx's death in 1883. His London home at this time and until his death was 122 Regent's Park Road, Primrose Hill, NW1. London Blue Plaques English Heritage - Accessed February 2007Marx's first London residence was a cramped apartment at 28 Dean Street, Soho. From 1856, he lived at 9 Grafton Terrace, Kentish Town, and then in a tenement at 41 Maitland Park Road from 1875 until his death.http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/photo/places/index.htm Photos of Marx's Residence(s)Later yearsAfter Marx's death, Engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing Marx's unfinished volumes of Capital. However, he also contributed significantly to other areas. Engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures have changed over history, and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property. He argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free from economic constraints. One of the best examples of Engels' thoughts on these issues are in his work The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State.Engels died of throat cancer in London in 1895.Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1895&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Following cremation at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, his ashes were scattered off Beachy Head, near Eastbourne as he had requested.Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1895&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Major Works''The Holy Family'' (1844) The Holy Family was a book written by Marx & Engels in November 1844. The book is a critique on the Young Hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the Bauer Brothers and their supporters.The Holy Family by Marx and Engels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The book created a controversy with much of the press and caused Bruno Bauer to attempt to refute the book in an article which was published in Wigand's Vierteljahrsschrift in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article that was published in the journal Gesellschaftsspiegel in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of The German Ideology.''The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844'' (1844) The Condition of the Working Class is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in Britain and Ireland during Engels' stay in England. It was considered a classic in its time and still widely available today. This work also had many seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development.''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (1878) Popularly known as Anti-Dühring, Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of Eugen Dühring, a German philosopher and critic of Marxism. In the course of replying to Dühring, Engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics and seeks to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena. Many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work, Dialectics of Nature. The last section of Anti-Dühring was later edited and published under the separate title, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880)In this essay, Engels critiques the utopian socialists, such as Fourier and Owen, and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism.''The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State'' (1884) The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State is an important and detailed seminal work connecting capitalism with what Engels argues is an ever changing institution - the family. It was written when Engels was 64 years of age and at the height of his intellectual power and contains a comprehensive historical view of the family in relation to the issues of class, female subjugation and private property.See alsoDas KapitalKarl MarxMarxismMary BurnsBiographiesCarlton, Grace (1965), Friedrich Engels: The Shadow Prophet.
