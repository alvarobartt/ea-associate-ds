Hematology (American English) or haematology (British English) is the branch of biology (physiology), pathology, clinical laboratory, internal medicine, and pediatrics that is concerned with the study of blood, the blood-forming organs, and blood diseases. Haematology includes the study of etiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of blood diseases. The lab work that goes into the study of blood is performed by a Medical Technologist.Blood diseases affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, the mechanism of coagulation, etc.Physicians specialized in hematology are known as haematologists. Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with haematological diseases, although some may also work at the haematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various haematological test results. In some institutions, haematologists also manage the haematology laboratory. Physicians who work in haematology laboratories, and most commonly manage it, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of haematological diseases, referred to as haematopathologists. Haematologists and haematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed. Haematology is a distinct subspecialty of internal medicine, separate from but overlapping with the subspecialty of medical oncology. Haematologists may specialise further or have special interests, for example in:treating bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpuratreating haematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia (onco haematology)treating haemoglobinopathiesin the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank''(Hema- comes from the Greek word "`'aima" meaning "blood", -ology means study of.)Common basic clinical hematology testsIn a clinical laboratory the hematology department performs numerous different tests on blood. The most commonly performed test is the complete blood count (CBC) also called full blood count (FBC), which includes; white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin level and several parameters of red blood cells. Coagulation is a sub-speciality of hematology; basic general coagulation tests are the prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Another common hematology test in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).In a blood bank the Coombs test is the most commonly performed test.Hematology as basic medical scienceBloodVenous bloodVenipunctureHaemopoiesisBlood testsCord bloodRed blood cellsErythropoiesisErythropoietinIron metabolismHaemoglobinGlycolysisPentose phosphate pathwayReticuloendothelial systemBone marrowSpleenLiverLymphatic systemBlood transfusionBlood plasmaBlood bankBlood donorsBlood groupsHaemostasisCoagulationVitamin KComplement systemImmunoglobulinsClassification of hematologic diseasesMajor categories of hematologic disease include:Hemoglobinopathies (congenital abnormality of the hemoglobin molecule or of the rate of hemoglobin synthesis)Anemias (lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin)Hematological malignanciesCoagulopathies (disorders of bleeding and coagulation)TestsTests used in the investigation of hematological problems include:Full blood countErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)Blood filmBone marrow examinationCoombs testDiascopyserum Ferritin levelVitamin B12 and Folate levelsProthrombin timePartial thromboplastin timeProtein electrophoresisHemoglobin electrophoresisD-dimerEOSTreatmentsTreatments include:Diet adviceOral medication - tablets or liquid medicinesAnticoagulation therapyIntramuscular injections (for example, Vitamin B12 injections)Blood transfusion (for anemia)Venesection also known as therepeutic phlebotomy (for iron overload or polycythemia)Bone marrow transplant (for example, for leukemia)Chemotherapy (for example, for leukemia)Radiotherapy (in decline, for example, for leukemia)Alphabetical listsHematologistsBlood disordersHematology topicsExternal linksAmerican Society of HematologyAsia-Pacific Journal of Cancer Therapeutics APJCT BloodLineMajor milestones in history of hematology (PDF)Multilingual indexExtensive Hematology Slide Collection  Category:Blood disorders Category:Hematology Category:Subjects taught in medical schoolaf:Hematologie ar:علم الدم bn:রক্তবিদ্যা bg:Хематология ca:Hematologia cs:Hematologie de:Hämatologie es:Hematología eo:Hematologio eu:Hematologia fa:خون‌شناسی fr:Hématologie gl:Hematoloxía id:Hematologi is:Blóðfræði it:Ematologia he:המטולוגיה la:Haematologia lt:Hematologija nl:Hematologie ne:रक्तशास्त्र ja:血液学 no:Hematologi nds:Hämatologie pl:Hematologia pt:Hematologia ro:Hematologie ru:Гематология sq:Hematologjia sk:Hematológia fi:Hematologia sv:Hematologi th:โลหิตวิทยา tl:Hematolohiya tr:Hematoloji uk:Гематологія zh:血液學
