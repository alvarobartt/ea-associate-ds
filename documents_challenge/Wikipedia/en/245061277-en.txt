In 1932 it was merged with the district of Meisenheim. The name of the district officially changed from Kreuznach to Bad Kreuznach in 1969.GeographyThe district is located in the hilly country between the mountain chains of the Hunsrück in the north and the Nordpfälzer Bergland in the south. The main axis of the district is the Nahe River, which enters the territory in the west, runs through Kirn, Bad Sobernheim and Bad Kreuznach, and leaves to the northeast.The region formed by this district and the adjoining Birkenfeld district is known as the Naheland. The banks of the lower Nahe are used for vineyards. Away from the stream there are sparsely populated forests crisscrossed by the narrow affluents of the Nahe River.Coat of armsTowns and municipalitiesVerband-free townsVerbandsgemeinden1seat of the Verbandsgemeinde; 2townExternal linksOfficial website (German)Naheland touristical website (German, English)www.KH-lokal.de - local community with more than 1.800 links to homepages of Bad Kreuznach (district)A flickr-group with fotos of Bad Kreuznach (district)  Category:Districts of Rhineland-Palatinatede:Landkreis Bad Kreuznach es:Distrito de Bad Kreuznach eo:Distrikto Bad Kreuznach fr:Arrondissement de Bad Kreuznach id:Bad Kreuznach (distrik) nl:Bad Kreuznach (district) pl:Powiat Bad Kreuznach pt:Bad Kreuznach (distrito) ro:Bad Kreuznach (district) ru:Бад-Кройцнах (район) sv:Landkreis Bad Kreuznach zh:巴特克罗伊茨纳赫县
