  My Chemical Romance (often shortened to MCR '''or My Chem') is an American alternative / post-hardcore quintet that formed in 2001. The current members of the band are Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Frank Iero, Ray Toro and Bob Bryar. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album ''I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004. The album was a commercial success, selling over one million copies. The band followed this success with 2006's The Black Parade, featuring their hit singles, "Welcome to the Black Parade", "Famous Last Words", "I Don't Love You", and "Teenagers". The band also filmed a live DVD in Mexico City, which was released on July 1, 2008.BackgroundEarly career (2001–2002)The band was formed by frontman Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier approximately one week after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Witnessing the planes crash into the World Trade Center influenced Way's life to the extent that he decided to start a band.Press conference held in Chile February 2008 Way wrote the song "Skylines and Turnstiles" to express his feelings about September 11th. Shortly thereafter, Ray Toro was called up and asked to join the band because at the time Way couldn't sing and play the guitar at the same time. The first recording sessions were done in Pelissier's attic, where the songs "Our Lady of Sorrows" (formerly called "Bring More Knives") and "Cubicles" were recorded. Frank Iero revealed that the band finished the lyrics to "Best Day Ever" moments before they arrived at the studio to begin recording. The band refers to those sessions as The Attic Demos. Mikey Way, the younger brother of Gerard, loved the demo so much that he decided to join the band after dropping out of college.My Chemical Romance signed with Eyeball Records, where Pencey Prep and Thursday recorded. While with Eyeball Records the band met Frank Iero, the lead vocalist and guitarist for Pencey Prep. After Pencey Prep broke up in 2001-02, Frank joined My Chemical Romance, just days before the band's debut album was recorded. Three months after the formation of the band they recorded their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, subsequently released in 2002 on Eyeball Records. Despite only joining the band a few days before the album recording sessions began, Iero played guitar on two of the tracks, "Early Sunsets Over Monroeville," and the other being "Demolition Lovers." During this time, the band was booked at the infamous venue, Big Daddy's, where they began to receive mainstream attention.http://www.drinkfreebeer.com citing http://www.americasbestvenues.com Untitled DocumentMy Chemical Romance offered free downloads through PureVolume&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[social network]]ing site [[MySpace]], where they gained an initial fan base.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Breakthrough (2003–2006)In 2003, the band signed a deal with Reprise Records. Following a tour with Avenged Sevenfold, the band began work on their second album, entitled Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Released in 2004, the album went platinum within a year. The band released four singles from the album: "Thank You for the Venom", "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)", "Helena" and "The Ghost of You". It was during this time that the band replaced Matt Pelissier with Bob Bryar, after they came back from Japan in July 2004.At the start of 2005, the band toured on the first ever Taste of Chaos tour, and was also the opening act for Green Day on the American Idiot tour. During the summer, they co-headlined the Warped Tour 2005 with Fall Out Boy. Later that year, My Chemical Romance co-headlined and headlined their tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect around the US. That same year, My Chemical Romance collaborated with The Used for a cover of the Queen and David Bowie classic, "Under Pressure" that was released as a benefit single on iTunes and other Internet outlets.On March 21, 2006, a 2 DVD/1 CD set entitled Life on the Murder Scene was released. It included one DVD chronicling the band's history, and a second DVD with music videos, the making of their videos, and a couple of live performances. An unauthorized biography DVD Things That Make You Go MMM! was also released on June 27, 2006. The DVD does not actually feature any My Chemical Romance music clips or performances, but contains interviews with those who knew the band before much of their fame.&lt;/ref&gt;The band started recording their third studio album on April 10, 2006 with Rob Cavallo, producer of many of Green Day's albums.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;punknews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought to be titled ''The Rise and Fall of My Chemical Romance'', but in an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, Gerard Way suggested this was just the album's working title, stating &quot;It was never the title of the album, more a spoof, or joke.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blackparade&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;On August 3, 2006, the band finished shooting the videos for their first two singles from the album, "Welcome to the Black Parade" and "Famous Last Words", which was released on January 22, 2007.Billboard.com - Discography - My Chemical Romance - Famous Last Words [WEA&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The video was directed by Sam Bayer, director of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Green Day's American Idiot videos.&lt;/ref&gt; During the shoot for &quot;Famous Last Words&quot;, band members Gerard Way and Bob Bryar were injured. Way suffered torn ligaments in his ankle, and Bryar a burn to the leg which caused a severe staph infection that needed constant monitoring in hospital. Consequently, the band was forced to cancel a few tour dates. While these injuries were reported by several news agencies to have been the result of a car accident, a statement released by the band on their website and [[MySpace]] page confirmed that these injuries occurred on the set of the video.&lt;ref name=&quot;mychemicalromance&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;''The Black Parade'' (2006–2007)[[Image:Mcr hammersmith album announcement.jpg|thumb|Announcement of The Black Parade at London Hammersmith Palais]] A biography titled Something Incredible This Way Comes was released, written by Paul Stenning (Published in 2006).

Later during the show the album title and the UK release date were confirmed. Prior to the band taking the stage it was announced that My Chemical Romance were unable to play, but they would be replaced by "The Black Parade".

See [[Talk:My Chemical Romance/Archive 2]]. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as rejecting the term &quot;[[Emo (music)|emo]]&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;aiminterview&quot;&gt; to describe their style. Although a source quotes frontman Gerard Way stating that they are "What-else-ya-got-emo", Way has recently stated in an interview that they were never emo, as he says emo is "a pile of shit." My Chemical Romance cite their main influences as Queen, Thursday, Iron Maiden, The Misfits, Morrissey/The Smiths and the Beastie Boys.On MTV2 in the UK aired on June 5, 2007, the band voted the Beastie Boys video for "Sabotage" as their #1 personal favourite and influential to them Gerard Way has said, "We love bands like Queen, where it's huge and majestic, but also bands like Black Flag and the Misfits, who would go absolutely crazy."My Chemical Romance: My Chemical Romance: Rolling Stone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Way has also said that his band patterns their career after that of The Smashing Pumpkins, another band they admire. Geoff Rickly, the lead singer of Thursday, has compared My Chemical Romance to Ink &amp; Dagger. Growing up, they were also very influenced by horror films and comic books, and therefore their music, lyrics, and image all have overt elements of fantasy, storytelling, horror, and theatricality.CriticismNumerous artists in other bands have criticized the band openly in the media, Marilyn Manson among them; rumors circulated for some time that he wrote the song "Mutilation is the Most Sincere Form of Flattery" as an attack on the band for his Eat Me, Drink Me release (which he later denied, saying that it was aimed at bands in general seeking to imitate him). In another interview Manson stated that "I'm embarrassed to be me because these people are doing a really sad, pitiful, shallow version of what I've done". In response to this, Gerard Way claimed nothing Manson could say would bring the band down.&lt;/ref&gt;Gerard Way struck out against fans and bands that classify My Chemical Romance as "Emo", saying that; “I think emo is fucking garbage, it's bullshit. I think there's bands that unfortunately get lumped in with that are considered emo and by default that starts to make us emo.” and, "I think emo's a pile of shit.” This caused much outcry from fans and critics alike.The 'emo scene', specifically My Chemical Romance, was criticised by the coroner at the inquest into the death by hanging of a girl from Maidstone, Kent in the United Kingdom named Hannah Bond. The coroner expressed concern that they glamorized suicide and her apparent obsession with the band was said to be linked to her suicide.&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest heard that Hannah had been part of a "self-harming cult" and had said she wanted to join other suicide victims in the "black parade". Supporters of emo music contacted NME to defend accusations that emo promotes suicide.&lt;/ref&gt;In response, fans had planned to march across London in protest against the depiction of the band in the media. The march was expected to be held on May 31, begin at Hyde Park's West Pond and end outside offices of The Daily Mail. The Daily Mail widely criticized My Chemical Romance and has run general pieces about the dangers of 'suicide cults'. The march has been expected to attract 500 to 1000 protesters according to the organizers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After concerns by police, the march was called off and instead about 100 fans congregated at [[Marble Arch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/31/dailymail.musicnews?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media Emo runs high as fans defend band against Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;The Daily Mail defended its position saying its coverage was 'balanced, and restrained' and 'in the public interest' and they were reporting genuine concerns raised by the coroner at the inquest and claim that their coverage of the incident has been misrepresented and confused with rumour. They state that their coverage of the coroner's remarks and the parents' comments was in common with that of other newspapers, and point to their publishing of readers letters defending the band and positive reviews of the band's albums and tours.&lt;/ref&gt;ToursMy Chemical Romance has been touring for many years, and has a reputation for sold-out shows, including the Vans Warped tour in their earlier career, amongst others. They have toured with many well-known bands, such as Fall Out Boy, The Used, Thursday, Green Day, and others.Warped Tour '05The 11th Annual Vans Warped tour featured My Chemical Romance on the Main Stage, along with The Offspring, Fall Out Boy, The All American Rejects, and 84 other bands including the likes of Atreyu, Good Charlotte, Saosin and many more. "For a lot of kids, it's the one thing they look forward to all year," said Gerard Way. "They save up for it. They get to see all the bands they like in one shot."

The tour launched September 15 in Ohio, stopping at 30 locations in the U.S., to promote their album, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Supporting were Alkaline Trio, and Reggie & The Full Effect. The tour was the beginnings of the heavy theatrics My Chemical Romance have played around with in their concerts, Gerard Way expressed his plans for the tour in an interview with MTV, "We'd talked about bringing out dancers for our headlining tour in the fall, but it's a big undertaking; you have to have a bus full of dancers. We've always wanted to do a big theatrical tour. But you have to do it in steps,"My Chemical Romance Announce Fall Tour Dates - News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.

The set ended with "Cancer", occasionally with falling confetti, and fireworks.Frontman Gerard Way has stated that it had been the best tour the band has ever been on. This tour is worth mentioning, as a stream of controversial events occurred, including the infamous kiss Gerard Way and Frank Iero shared during a performance of "You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison" in San Bernardino on July 28.. My Chemical Romance has announced that following the Projekt Revolution tour they will be opening for Bon Jovi in October, and depart for a European Tour, with Mindless Self Indulgence supporting.US TourBefore their break, My Chemical Romance went on a tour with Drive By and Billy Talent, where Taking Back Sunday replaced Billy Talent for the last two shows of the tour, starting in Philadelphia and ending with their sold-out show at Madison Square Garden. After that, they are taking an extended break before they start their next record, which is thought to be released by 2009.Band membersGerard Way - vocalsRay Toro - lead guitar, vocalsFrank Iero - rhythm guitar, vocals (2002 - present)Mikey Way - bass guitarBob Bryar - drums, percussion (2004 - present)Former membersMatt Pelissier - drums (2001 - 2004)Live membersJames Dewees - keyboards (2007-2008)DiscographyStudio albums2002: I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love2004: Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge2006: The Black ParadeLive albums2006: Life on the Murder Scene2008: The Black Parade is Dead!Awards and nominationsNominationsGrammy Award 2008 Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package - The Black ParadeReferencesSee alsoExternal links My Chemical Romance official websiteMy Chemical Romance at ImeemCategory:2000s music groupsCategory:American emo musical groupsCategory:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:My Chemical Romance Category:New Jersey musical groups Category:Quintets Category:Musical groups with siblingsaf:My Chemical Romance ar:ماي كيميكال رومانس bg:My Chemical Romance ca:My Chemical Romance cs:My Chemical Romance da:My Chemical Romance de:My Chemical Romance et:My Chemical Romance el:My chemical romance es:My Chemical Romance fr:My Chemical Romance ko:마이 케미컬 로맨스 hr:My Chemical Romance id:My Chemical Romance is:My Chemical Romance it:My Chemical Romance he:מיי כמיקל רומנס la:My Chemical Romance lb:My Chemical Romance lt:My Chemical Romance hu:My Chemical Romance ms:My Chemical Romance nah:My Chemical Romance nl:My Chemical Romance ja:マイ・ケミカル・ロマンス no:My Chemical Romance nn:My Chemical Romance uz:My Chemical Romance pl:My Chemical Romance pt:My Chemical Romance ro:My Chemical Romance ru:My Chemical Romance simple:My Chemical Romance sk:My Chemical Romance sl:My Chemical Romance sr:My Chemical Romance fi:My Chemical Romance sv:My Chemical Romance tl:My Chemical Romance th:มาย เคมิคอล โรแมนซ์ vi:My Chemical Romance tr:My Chemical Romance uk:My Chemical Romance zh:我的另類羅曼史
