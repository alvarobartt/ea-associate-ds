The Old Yishuv residents were religious Jews living mainly in Jerusalem, Safed, Tiberias and Hebron. Smaller communities were in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki'in, Acre, Nablus, Shfaram and until 1779 also in Gaza. A large part of the Old Yishuv concentrated their time in Torah studies and lived off Ma'amodot (stipends), received by donations from the Jews in the Diaspora.The New Yishuv refers to those who built homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s, and to the establishment of Petah Tikva and the First Aliyah of 1882, followed by the founding of settlements until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.See alsoHistory of IsraelZionismCategory:Hebrew words and phrases Category:Zionism Category:History of IsraelCategory:Jews in Ottoman and British Palestinear:يشوب cs:Jišuv de:Jischuw es:Yishuv fr:Yichouv it:Yishuv he:היישוב nl:Jisjoev pl:Osadnictwo żydowskie w Palestynie ru:Ишув sv:Jisjuv
