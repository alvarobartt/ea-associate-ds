Rather, it is a "new" production with English-speaking actors spliced in with the original Japanese footage in varying ratios. Due to the very Japanese nature of many of the Super Sentai Series' stories and design, the American shows are altered to fit a Western audience. However, many of the action sequences featuring the characters in costume and the mecha (referred to as "Zords" in the English series) are typically dubbed.The current executive producers are Bruce Kalish and Koichi Sakamoto. Kalish became an executive producer in starting with Power Rangers: S.P.D. Sakamato became executive producer starting with Power Rangers: Ninja Storm. Previous executive producers include Haim Saban, Shuki Levy, Douglas Sloan and Ann Austen.Broadcasting summaryThe series that began the franchise was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which began broadcasting as part of the Fox Kids (now 4Kids TV) group of programs that aired on the Fox network. It lasted for three seasons (from 1993 to 1996). The franchise has continued, and as of 2008 has consisted of 16 television seasons, 14 different series, and two theatrical films. The fifteenth season and thirteenth series, Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive, debuted on February 26, 2007, and completed on November 12, 2007. The new series, Power Rangers: Jungle Fury debuted on February 18, 2008.The Power Rangers series was distributed by Saban Entertainment from 1993 until the end of 2001 and was broadcast on Fox until the fall of 2002. The franchise was purchased by the Walt Disney Company as a part of the buyout that took place between 2001 and 2002. This resulted in Fox Family Worldwide becoming ABC Family Worldwide. This buyout also included Saban Entertainment becoming BVS Entertainment, from News Corporation, Fox's parent company, and Haim Saban. The show continued to air on Fox until its Fox Kids package was renamed the "FoxBox" in the United States. Since September 2002, all Power Rangers shows have aired on various Disney-owned networks (ABC Kids, Toon Disney and Jetix channels worldwide). ABC Family, another Disney-owned network, also used to air Power Rangers until it did away with its Jetix timeslot after August 31, 2006. Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups, most notably Hearst-Argyle Television and Allbritton have declined to air most of the Power Rangers series aired since 2005 on ABC Kids, due to the lack of FCC-compliant educational and informational content in the programs.The Power RangersA Power Ranger is a fictional individual who "Morphs" from an unpowered form into a powerful superhero usually wearing a brightly colored battle suit usually made of spandex featuring a helmet with an opaque visor. In many cases, the helmet serves to protect his or her secret identity. (In some cases, more powerful Rangers may have extra shielding on their suit to protect them from strong blows.)A morphed Ranger generally possesses superhuman strength, durability, and hand-to-hand combat ability; unmorphed Rangers may possess other innate abilities such as telekinesis,See Andros from Power Rangers: in Space super speed,Demonstrated by Conner McKnight in Day of the Dino in Power Rangers: Dino Thunder invisibilityTommy Oliver displayed this skill in "Back in Black" et al, in Power Rangers: Dino Thunder that are usually not directly related to his or her Ranger powers.Rangers appear to retain their original physiology beneath their suits when in morphed form, as Rangers' helmets have been seen removed or broken on numerous occasionsTommy Oliver removed his White Ranger helmet in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode "White Light", Leo Corbett, the Red Ranger in Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy, had his visor smashed in "Journey's End"., revealing his or her natural form underneath.There are exceptions to this rule: Justin, the Blue Turbo Ranger, was in his early teens and was much shorter than his Ranger form when unmorphed; Anubis "Doggie" Cruger, the S.P.D. Shadow Ranger, has a muzzle that seems to disappear beneath the helmet; and Daggeron, the Solaris Knight, transforms into his Ancient Mystic Mode while in the process of morphing. Helmets aside, the suits are donned and removed nearly instantaneously with a glow of light or some other effect. Sometimes, Rangers "de-morph" involuntarily due to powerful physical attacks.Rangers regularly operate in teams of five, with a special sixth Ranger frequently joining the team part way into the series;This has been the modus operandi from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers through to Power Rangers: Wild Force. More recently a core team of three will later be joined by additional Rangers. Each Ranger's suit and energy spectrum will match a specific color, with red, yellow, and blue being joined by some combination of pink, green, black, or white. Rangers may be named after their respective colors, such as Red Ranger, Blue Ranger, etc., but numbers or other names may also be used. There is usually no more than one Ranger of a given color on a team, but exceptions of this rule are generally given alternate names (in Time Force, there were two Rangers with red-colored costumes; the first was the Red Time Force Ranger, the second was the Quantum Ranger). Each team's costumes are nearly identical aside from color, helmet design (most notably the shape of the opaque visor) and perhaps a numerical designation. Any additional Rangers will regularly have additional costume modifications, usually some form of additional armor.The Rangers' color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series, as their civilian clothing is often the same color as their Ranger color. This correlation was joked about in Dino Thunder when Tommy Oliver (a former Green Ranger, White Ranger, and twice a Red Ranger) became the new Black Dino Ranger; he said that he had to go shopping because he did not own enough black-colored clothing.Elements of a Power Rangers seasonEach team of Power Rangers, with few exceptions, obey a general set of conventions, outlined at the beginning of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and implied, though not stated explicitly, throughout many of the other incarnations. These include the Power Rangers being forbidden to use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight, explaining why the Rangers do not simply crush the small monsters by means of their Megazord. The Power Rangers are also forbidden to disclose their identities to the general public, barring extenuating circumstances, although this rule was disregarded in Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue, Power Rangers: S.P.D. and Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive, in which they were public servants squad, police officers, etc. Following a Spartacus-inspired scene by Angel Grove's townspeople, this rule was also disregarded at the conclusion of Power Rangers in Space and, to a lesser extent, Power Rangers: Mystic Force. The penalty for disobeying these rules, at least in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, would be the loss of their power.The arsenal available to the Power Rangers is also somewhat standardized: each Ranger is generally armed with a weapon such as a laser gun and/or a sword. Each Ranger also has a secondary set of weapons that can often combine to form a larger weapon (usually a cannon). As the series progresses, one or more of the Rangers are also usually given a motorcycle for long-distance travel, as well as individual Zords. In many series, a Ranger is also given additional Zords or weapons. In some cases, one Ranger may receive something that other Rangers may not have; an example of this is the Battlizer given to the Red Ranger of each series since Power Rangers in Space. Although much of the arsenal can also be found in Super Sentai, there are usually at least some that are not, generally added for the express purpose of marketing toys designed and sold by Bandai.Power Rangers series regularly have villains of their own make which do not appear in the Sentai footage, though for budget and footage reasons there are always carry-overs from the Japanese source material. Less commonly, some series use only the Sentai designs and footage, though despite this some sets have to be replicated for original footage if need be. There was also one instance when to maintain the trend of the Sixth Ranger for a series where only five existed in the source footage, the Titanium Ranger was created especially for Lightspeed Rescue.In seasons following Power Rangers in Space, it became common for each team to be part of a separate storyline from those of previous incarnations. A tradition in later seasons came about such that two teams of Power Rangers teamed up to take on a villain. In Power Rangers: Wild Force, the tenth incarnation of Power Rangers, this is taken to the next level, as ten Red Rangers teamed up in the episode "Forever Red", and in Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive a team of former rangers from various incarnations of the series teamed up with the Overdrive Rangers to defeat an alliance formed by the son of Rita & Lord Zedd, Thrax, in the episode Once a Ranger. The only seasons thus far to not feature such a team-up are Power Rangers: Ninja Storm, due to a shift back to non-SAG talent when production was moved to New Zealand, and Power Rangers: Mystic Force, due to a relatively short series length. This was somewhat rectified when Xander, the Green Mystic Force Ranger, and Tori, the Blue Ninja Storm Ranger, appeared in the Operation Overdrive crossover two-parter, "Once A Ranger".It is traditional that the arsenal of a Ranger team, especially the Zords, be destroyed at the end of the season in order to destroy the final monster, which is often the main villain. The Rangers also tend to give up their powers, though they remain available for later teaming-ups (For instance, at the end of Ninja Storm, the Rangers sacrificed their powers to imprison Lothor. Once Lothor was freed, however, they were able to get their powers back in order to fight him).SeasonsSeasonYearBased onMighty Morphin Power Rangers1993–1995Kyōryū Sentai ZyurangerGosei Sentai DairangerNinja Sentai KakurangerMighty Morphin Alien Rangers1996Ninja Sentai KakurangerPower Rangers: Zeo1996Chouriki Sentai OhrangerPower Rangers: Turbo1997Gekisou Sentai CarrangerPower Rangers in Space1998Denji Sentai MegarangerPower Rangers: Lost Galaxy1999Seijuu Sentai GingamanPower Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue2000Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGo-VPower Rangers: Time Force2001Mirai Sentai TimerangerPower Rangers: Wild Force2002Hyakujuu Sentai GaorangerPower Rangers: Ninja Storm2003Ninpuu Sentai HurricanegerPower Rangers: Dino Thunder2004Bakuryuu Sentai AbarangerPower Rangers: S.P.D.2005Tokusou Sentai DekarangerPower Rangers: Mystic Force2006Mahou Sentai MagirangerPower Rangers: Operation Overdrive2007GoGo Sentai BoukengerPower Rangers: Jungle Fury2008Juken Sentai GekirangerPower Rangers: R.P.M.2009Engine Sentai Go-ongerColorsJust like the Super Sentai series that Power Rangers is based on, the color palette of a Power Ranger team has varied greatly throughout the years. #SeriesRedYellowBluePinkBlackGreenWhiteOther]]1Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (Season 1 & 2)✔✔✔✔✔✔2Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (Season 2 & 3) Teams  Mighty Morphin|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔3Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers✔✔✔✔✔4Power Rangers: Zeo Teams  Zeo|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔5Power Rangers: Turbo Teams  Turbo|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔6Power Rangers in Space Teams  Space|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔7Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy Teams  Lost Galaxy|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔8Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue Teams  Lightspeed Rescue|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔9Power Rangers: Time Force Teams  Time Force|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔10Power Rangers: Wild Force Teams  Wild Force|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔✔11Power Rangers: Ninja Storm Teams  Ninja Storm|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔12Power Rangers: Dino Thunder Teams  Dino Thunder|accessdate=2007-06-09✔✔✔✔✔13Power Rangers: S.P.D.

In Time Force, the sixth ranger, the Quantum Ranger, has a red-colored suit which is only distinguished from the Red Ranger's suit by its black accents and the jagged arrows.  Ninja Storm has the Crimson and Navy Rangers that wear suits of darker hues of Red and Blue, respectively.  SPD includes nine additional rangers, a final count of fourteen rangers, which is the most in all of the Power Rangers franchise history. Both the Omega Ranger (who wears a White suit) and the Shadow Ranger (who wears a primarily Black suit) are regular characters, whereas the Kat Ranger (who wears a primarily Orange suit) and the Nova Ranger (who wears a Silver suit) are only seen for one episode each. The S.P.D. A-Squad wear the same colors as the main team.  Mystic Force has two allies who do not fall under the basic color schemes. The Solaris Knight wears gold armor over navy blue spandex and the Wolf Warrior wears dark red armor.  Jungle Fury has the Wolf Ranger who wears a violet suit, and the Rhino Ranger who wears a white suit. The Shark Ranger (Cyan), the Bat Ranger (Black), and the Elephant Ranger (Green) join Lightspeed Rescue's Titanium Ranger and S.P.D.'s A-Squad as characters with no basis in the Super Sentai footage.Spin-offMasked Rider is an American adaptation of the tokusatsu series Kamen Rider BLACK RX, one of the many series of the popular Kamen Rider Series. It was produced by Saban and aired in 1995. It was a spin-off of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.The main title character of Masked Rider was featured on a three-part Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode (A Friend in Need) before his own series was started. The Rangers themselves were never mentioned in the television run of Masked Rider, however, as Saban reformatted the series to sever links with Power Rangers, given that their popularity had been gradually beginning to slide following the first films. However, the Rangers were featured in the home video release of the Masked Rider story Super Gold, in the form of narrated clips from A Friend in Need, and also made a guest appearance in Masked Rider's short-lived comic book adaptation.It has been heavily criticized for splicing random footage from the Kamen Rider Series' shows and films, to the point it was obvious that the Rider was wearing different costumes.Motion pictures[[Image:Power rangers movie poster.jpg|185px|thumb|Teaser poster for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.]] The Power Rangers series have also brought forth two theatrical films, which were distributed by 20th Century Fox. As of 2007, Fox's home entertainment division, long after Fox's parent company News Corporation and Haim Saban sold Fox Family (currently ABC Family), including Saban Entertainment and the Power Rangers franchise, to the Walt Disney Company, still maintains worldwide home entertainment rights to these two Power Rangers films.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, 1995Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, 1997Stage showMighty Morphin Power Rangers World Tour Live on Stage was the name of the stage show that toured during the second season of the TV show. It featured all the characters on the TV show at around the same time as The Wedding. This stage show was also similar to the Super Sentai stage shows that are held every year when a current series being broadcast in Japan, and are held at Tokyo Dome along with other shows featuring Toei Superheroes.Power MorphiconThe Power Morphicon was the first Power Rangers Convention that took place in 2007, celebrating fifteen years on the air at the time, from 1993.Some of the guests that attended were Austin St. John, who portrayed Jason Lee Scott; Steve Cardenas, who portrayed Rocky DeSantos; Walter Jones, who portrayed Zack Taylor; Johnny Yong Bosch, who portrayed Adam Park; Paul Schrier and Jason Narvy, who portrayed Bulk and Skull; Daniel Southworth, who portrayed Eric Myers; Emma Lahana, who portrayed Kira Ford; Matt Austin, who portrayed Bridge Carson; Richard Brancatisano, who portrayed Xander Bly; James Maclurcan, who portrayed Mackenzie Hartford; and Samuell Benta, who portrayed Will Aston.Some of the panels included were "Forever Red," where Red Rangers St. John, Cardenas, Southworth, and Maclurcan were interviewed; "Unsung Heroes," where Jones, Bosch, Schrier, Narvy, Austin, Brancatisano, and Benta were interviewed; "Where Are They Now," where St. John, Cardenas, Bosch, Narvy, and Tony Oliver were interviewed; "Bulk and Skull," where Schrier and Narvy were interviewed; and "Origins of Red," where St. John alone was interviewed.DVD releasesCurrently, there are 28 DVD releases of Power Rangers in the USA (as listed below).The current Power Rangers DVD titles are:Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, 1995; 20th Century Fox Home EntertainmentTurbo: A Power Rangers Movie, 1997; 20th Century Fox Home EntertainmentMighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie/Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, 1995, 1997; 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment (DVD compilation set of both movies.)The Best of the Power Rangers: The Ultimate Rangers, 2003; BVHE (DVD compilation of episodes from five different seasons of Power Rangers.
