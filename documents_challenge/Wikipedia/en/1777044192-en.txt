It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1951 and is named after the mythological Ananke, the mother of Adrastea by Jupiter. The adjectival form of the name is Anankean.Ananke did not receive its present name until 1975;&lt;/ref&gt; before then, it was simply known as . It was sometimes called "Adrastea" between 1955 and 1975. Note that Adrastea is now the name of another satellite of Jupiter.Ananke gives its name to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 Gm, at inclinations of roughly 150°.Sheppard, S.

Eight irregular satellites discovered since 2000 follow similar orbits.The orbital elements are as of January 2000. They are continuously changing due to Solar and planetary perturbations. The diagram illustrates Ananke's orbit in relation to other retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter. The eccentricity of selected orbits is represented by the yellow segments (extending from the pericentre to the apocentre). The outermost regular satellite Callisto is located for reference.Given these orbital elements and the physical characteristics known so far, Ananke is thought to be the largest remnant&lt;/ref&gt; of an original break-up forming the Ananke group. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grav2003"Physical characteristicsIn the visible spectrum, Ananke appears neutral to light-red (colour indices B-V=0.90 V-R=0.38).The infrared spectrum is similar to P-type asteroids but with a possible indication of water.&lt;/ref&gt;See alsoIrregular satellitesReferences  Ephemeris IAU-MPC NSESExternal linksAnanke Profile by NASA's Solar System ExplorationDavid Jewitt pagesScott Sheppard pages Category:Jupiter's moons Category:Irregular satellitesals:Ananke (Mond) bs:Ananka (mjesec) br:Ananke (loarenn) bg:Ананке (спътник) ca:Ananké (satèl·lit) co:Ananke da:Ananke (måne) de:Ananke (Mond) el:Ανάγκη (δορυφόρος) es:Ananké (luna) eo:Ananko (luno) fr:Ananké (lune) hr:Ananka (mjesec) it:Ananke (astronomia) he:אננקה lv:Ananke (pavadonis) lt:Anankė (palydovas) nl:Ananke (maan) ja:アナンケ (衛星) nn:Jupitermånen Ananke nds:Ananke (Maand) pl:Ananke (księżyc) pt:Ananke (satélite) ru:Ананке (спутник) simple:Ananke (moon) sk:Ananke (mesiac) sl:Ananka (luna) sr:Ананке fi:Ananke (kuu) sv:Ananke (måne) zh:木卫十二
