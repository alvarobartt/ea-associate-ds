 Ununhexium (http://reference.aol.com/columbia/_a/ununhexium/20051207161909990011 or ) is the temporary name of a synthetic superheavy element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uuh and has the atomic number 116.  Four isotopes are currently known with masses 290-293. The most stable is Uuh-293 with a half-life of 63 ms.Discovery profileOn July 19, 2000, scientists at Dubna (FLNR) detected a single decay from an atom of ununhexium following the irradiation of a Cm-248 target with Ca-48 ions. The results were published in December, 2000. &quot;Observation of the decay of &lt;sup&gt;292&lt;/sup&gt;116&quot;, Oganessian et al., Phys. Rev. C 63, 011301 (2000). Retrieved on 2008-03-03 This 10.54 MeV alpha-emitting activity was originally assigned to 292Uuh due to the correlation of the daughter to previously assigned 288Uuq. However, that assignment was later altered to 289Uuq, and hence this activity was correspondingly changed to 293Uuh. Two further atoms were reported by the institute during their second experiment between April-May 2001.&quot;Confirmed results of the &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,4n)&lt;sup&gt;292&lt;/sup&gt;116 experiment&quot;, Patin et al., LLNL report (2003).

This activity has not been observed again in a repeat of the same reaction. However, its detection in this series of experiments indicates the possibility of the decay of a meta-stable isomer of ununhexium, namely 293m116, or a rare decay branch of the already discovered ground state isomer, in which the first alpha particle was missed. Further research is required to positively assign this activity.The team repeated the experiment in April-May 2005 and detected 8 atoms of ununhexium. The measured decay data confirmed the assignment of the discovery isotope as 293116. In this run, the team also observed 292116 in the 4n channel for the first time.&quot;Measurements of cross sections and decay properties of the isotopes of elements 112, 114, and 116 produced in the fusion reactions &lt;sup&gt;233,238&lt;/sup&gt;U , &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu , and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca&quot;, Oganessian et al., Phys.

Ununhexium (Uuh) is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name. Research scientists usually refer to the element simply as element 116 (E116).Proposed names by ClaimantsClaims to the discovery of element 116 have been put forward by Dmitriev of the Dubna team. The JWP will decide to whom the right to suggest a name will be given. The IUPAC have the final say on the official adoption of a name. No name for element 116 has yet been suggested by the Dubna team.Disallowed namesAccording to IUPAC rules, names used for previous elements that have ultimately not been adopted are not allowed to be proposed for future use. The table below summarises those names which are probably not allowed to be proposed by the claimant laboratories under the rules.NameSymbolReasonLeosiumLsUsed for claimed discovery of element 43KurchatoviumKuUsed for claimed discovery of element 104FleroviumFlUsed for claimed discovery of element 102For use, see http://www.mi.infn.it/conferences/zhuikov/italy1c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Plausible namesMany speculative names appear in popular literature.

The group oxidation state of +VI is known for all the members apart from oxygen which lacks available d-orbitals for expansion and is limited to a maximum +II state, exhibited in the fluoride OF2. The +IV is known for sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium, undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for S(IV) and Se(IV) to oxidising in Po(IV). Tellurium(IV) is the most stable for this element. This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended and element 116 should portray an oxidising +IV state and a more stable +II state. The lighter members are also known to form a −II state as oxide, sulfide, selenide, and telluride. Polonide formation is nonconfirmed or only transient. The extrapolated electronegativity of ununhexium should eliminate this low]] oxidation state.ChemistryThe possible chemistry of element 116 can be extrapolated from that of polonium. It should therefore undergo oxidation to a dioxide, UuhO2, although a trioxide, UuhO3 is plausible, but unlikely. The stability of a +II state should manifest itself in the formation of a simple monoxide, UuhO. Fluorination will likely result in a tetrafluoride, UuhF4 and/or a difluoride, UuhF2. Chlorination and bromination may well stop at the corresponding dihalides, UuhCl2 and UuhBr2. Oxidation by iodine should certainly stop at UuhI2 and may even be inert to this element.History of synthesis of isotopes by cold fusion&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb(&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Se,xn)&lt;sup&gt;290−x&lt;/sup&gt;116In 2098, the team at GSI attempted the synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;116 as a radiative capture (x=0) product.

They were unable to detect any atoms of ununhexium. Yuri Oganessian and his team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) subsequently attempted the reaction in 1978 and were met by failure. In 1985, a joint experiment between Berkeley and Peter Armbruster's team at GSI, the result was again negative with a calculated cross-section limit of 10–100 pb.In 2000, Russian scientists at Dubna finally succeeded in detecting a single atom of element 116, assigned to the isotope 292116. In 2001, they repeated the reaction and formed a further 2 atoms in a confirmation of their discovery experiment. A third atom was tentatively assigned to 293116 on the basis of a missed parental alpha decay. In April 2004, the team ran the experiment again at higher energy and were able to detect a new decay chain, assigned to 292116. On this basis, the original data were reassigned to 293116. The tentative chain is therefore possibly associated with a rare decay branch of this isotope. In this reaction, 3 further atoms of 293116 were detected.&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,xn)&lt;sup&gt;293−x&lt;/sup&gt;116 (x=2,3)In order to assist in the assignment of isotope mass numbers for ununhexium, in March-May 2003 the Dubna team bombarded a Cm-245 target with Ca-48 ions. They were able to observe two new isotopes, assigned to 291116 and 290116.&quot;Measurements of cross sections for the fusion-evaporation reactions &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,xn)&lt;sup&gt;292−x&lt;/sup&gt;114 and &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,xn)&lt;sup&gt;293−x&lt;/sup&gt;116&quot;, Oganessian et al., Phys.

In October 2006 it was announced that 3 atoms of ununoctium had been detected by the bombardment of californium-249 with calcium-48 ions, which then rapidly decayed into ununhexium.The observation of 290116 allowed the assignment of the product to 294118 and proved the synthesis of a nucleus with Z=118 (see ununoctium).Chronology of isotope discoveryIsotopeYear discoveredDiscoverer reaction290Uuh2002249Cf(48Ca,3n)see ununoctium291Uuh2003245Cm(48Ca,2n)292Uuh2004248Cm(48Ca,4n)293Uuh2000248Cm(48Ca,3n)Yields of isotopesHot fusionThe table below provides cross-sections and excitation energies for hot fusion reactions producing ununhexium isotopes directly.

The claimed isotope 289116 decayed by 11.63MeV alpha emission with a halflife of 0.64 ms. The following year, they published a retraction after other researchers were unable to duplicate the results.Editorial note on the preceding. In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by the principal author Victor Ninov. As such, this ununhexium isotope is currently unknown or deconfirmed.Future experimentsThe team at Dubna are planning to revisit the synthesis in 2008. They will bombard a plutonium-244 target with titanium-50 ions. This experiment will allow them to assess the feasibility of using projectiles with Z20 required in the synthesis of SHE's with Z118. There are also plans to repeat the Cm-248 reaction at different projectile energies in order to probe the 2n channel, leading to the new isotope 294116. In addition they hope to complete the excitation function of the 4n channel product, 292116, which will allow them to assess the stabilising effect of the N=184 shell on the yield of evaporation residues.ReferencesSee alsoIsland of stabilityExternal linksWebElements.com: UuhApsidium: Ununhexium 116Second postcard from the island of stability  Category:Chalcogens Category:Chemical elements Category:Poor metals Category:Post-transition metals Category:Synthetic elements Category:Nuclear physicsar:أنون هيكسيوم ast:Ununhexiu bn:ইউনানহেক্সিয়াম be:Унунгексій bs:Ununheksijum ca:Ununhexi cs:Ununhexium co:Ununhexiu da:Ununhexium de:Ununhexium et:Ununheksium el:Ununhexium es:Ununhexio eo:Ununheksio fr:Ununhexium fur:Ununhexium ga:Únúinheicsiam gv:Oonoonhecsium ko:우눈헥슘 hr:Ununheksij it:Ununhexio he:אונונהקסיום sw:Ununheksi ku:Ûnûnheksiyûm la:Ununhexium lb:Ununhexium hu:Ununhexium ml:അണ്‍അണ്‍ഹെക്സിയം nl:Ununhexium ja:ウンウンヘキシウム no:Ununhexium nn:Ununhexium nds:Ununhexium pl:Ununhexium pt:Ununhexio ro:Ununhexiu ru:Унунгексий scn:Ununhexiu simple:Ununhexium sk:Ununhexium sr:Унунхексијум sh:Ununheksijum fi:Ununheksium sv:Ununhexium th:อูนอูนเฮกเซียม tr:Ununheksiyum uk:Унунгексій zh:Uuh
