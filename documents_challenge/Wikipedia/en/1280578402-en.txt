It's one of life's great ironies that today, outside of reggae circles, Cliff is better known for his film appearances than his music. Even after a string of hits, the singer never quite managed to break into the mainstream, although in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he seemed poised for international stardom.Allmusic.com biographyCareerCliff moved to Kingston in 1962. After two singles that failed to make much impression, his career took off after his "Hurricane Hattie" became a hit, while he was aged 14. It was produced by Leslie Kong, with whom Cliff would remain until Kong's death. Cliff's later local hit singles included "King of Kings", "Dearest Beverley" and "Pride and Passion". In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of the Jamaican representatives at the World's Fair and Cliff soon signed to Island Records and moved to the UK. Island Records initially (and unsuccessfully) tried to sell Cliff to the rock audience, but his career took off in the late 1960s.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter: "Reggae: The Rough Guide", 1997, Rough Guides, ISBN 1-85828-247-0 His international debut album was Hard Road to Travel, which received excellent reviews and included "Waterfall", a Brazilian hit that won the International Song Festival."Waterfall" was followed in 1969 by "Wonderful World, Beautiful People" and "Vietnam" in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. Folk rock singer-songwriter Bob Dylan even called "Vietnam" the best protest song he'd ever heard. His album Wonderful World, Beautiful People included a cover of Cat Stevens' "Wild World", which was a success in 1970.Leslie Kong died of a heart attack in 1971. The soundtrack to the 1972 reggae film The Harder They Come was a huge success that sold well across the world, but did not break Cliff into the mainstream. The film made its debut at London's Notting Hill Gaumont cinema on 1 September 1972. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa, exploring his newfound Muslim spirituality. He quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with Kool &amp; the Gang for The Power and the Glory (1983). In 1984 Cliff appeared at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, in the Netherlands.During the 1981 River Tour, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band added Cliff's little-known song "Trapped" to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985's We Are the World benefit album).

Also in 1985 Cliff contributed to the song "Sun City", a protest song written by Steven Van Zandt and recorded by Artists United Against Apartheid to convey opposition to the South African policy of apartheid. Cliff then provided backing vocals on The Rolling Stones' 1986 album, Dirty Work.In 1991 Cliff appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He continued to sell well in Jamaica and, to a lesser extent, the UK, returning to the mainstream pop charts in the U.S. and elsewhere (#1 in France) with a version of Johnny Nash's "I Can See Clearly Now" on the Cool Runnings film soundtrack in 1993. In 1995 Cliff released the single "Hakuna Matata" (a collaboration with Lebo M), a song from the soundtrack of the film The Lion King,In 2002, Cliff released the album, Fantastic Plastic People in Europe, after first providing free downloads using p2p software. This album featured collaborations with Joe Strummer, Annie Lennox, and Sting as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff's original hits.
