However the role for which Jackson is best known is as the lovable-smart-ass-side-kick Pacey Witter on Dawson's Creek. This television show, which was one of the most popular on the now defunct WB network, ran from 1998-2003, and also starred James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams and Katie Holmes.

In 2005, Jackson moved to the UK and made his stage debut on the London West End with Patrick Stewart in David Mamet's two-man play, A Life in the Theatre. The play was a critical and popular success, and ran from February to April of that year. Jackson has said in recent interviews that he would consider returning to the stage, this time trying his hand on Broadway. His next film role was in the all-star ensemble drama Bobby, directed by Emilio Estevez, Jackson's co-star from The Mighty Ducks. Recently, he was in Tokyo, filming a US remake of the Asian horror film Shutter.
