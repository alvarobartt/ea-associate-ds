InternazionaleAS RomaF.C. InternazionaleRiminiBarcelona Helenio Herrera (17 April 1910 in Buenos Aires – 9 November 1997 in Venice) was a French-Argentine football player and manager. Herrera had a relatively modest career as a player but, with 16 major titles, he became not only one of the most successful, but also one of the most influential managers in the history of the game.Playing careerThere is a controversy regarding his year of birth, as, in the 50s, he manipulated his birth year changing it to from 1910 to 1916. While born in Argentina, Herrera emigrated at age four with his parents (both Spanish) to Casablanca, Morocco where he adopted French citizenship. Playing as a defender, in 1932 he earned a transfer from RC Casablanca to mainland France - CASG Paris. Before World War II, Herrera (or H.H. as he was known) played in Stade Français, FCO Charleville (where he was called up for the national team twice) and Excelsior Roubaix. During the war, he played for five years more in Red Star Paris, Stade Français, EF Paris-Capitale and Puteaux, where he started his managing career in 1944 as a player-manager. He retired in 1945, and while his playing career was very short of notable, his managing career, coinciding with the early beginnings of UEFA competitions, had a marked effect on the game's tactical definitions.Managing careerAfter his first season in Puteaux, Herrera rejoined Stade Français for a third time now as manager. After three seasons with no trophies collected, the club's president opted to sell the franchise. Herrera moved to Spain, where he spent the next six years in minor stints with Real Valladolid, Atlético Madrid, CD Málaga, Deportivo de La Coruña and Sevilla FC, before entering a two year tenure with Lisbon side CF Os Belenenses. Later returning to Spain, he managed giants FC Barcelona, but several problems, including disagreements between him and star player Ladislao Kubala obliged him to leave the club in 1960.He emigrated to Italy and signed with Internazionale, winning two European Champions Cup in his stay with the club, where he modified a 5-3-2 tactic known as the Verrou (door bolt) to include larger flexibility for counter attacks - and the Catenaccio was born. During this time he was also coaching Spain (between 1959 and 1962) and Italy (1966-67). In 1968 the moved to AS Roma (winning one cup), but returned for a one year stint with Inter for the 1973-74 season. Then suffered a heart attack, did not want to coach full time anymore and retired in Venice where he lived the rest of his life. While inactive between 1974 and 1978, Herrera returned briefly during the end of the decade, managing Rimini Calcio and finally ending his career with a return to FC Barcelona for two half seasons in 1980 and 1981.InfluenceHe pioneered the use of psychological motivating skills -his pep-talk phrases are still quoted today, e.g. "who doesn't give it all, gives nothing" or "with 10 our team plays better than with 11" (after his team had to face the second half of a game with only 10 players on the field). He also enfored a strict discipline code, for the first time forbidding players to drink or smoke and controlling their diet - once in Inter he suspended a player after telling the press "we came to play in Rome" instead of "we came to win in Rome". He was also one of the first managers to call the support of the "12th player" - the spectators. While indirectly, this led to the appearance of the first Ultras movements in the late 60s. While defensive in nature, his take on the Catenaccio was slightly different than that practiced by other Italian teams and the original Verrou, as he often used the full backs (particularly Giacinto Facchetti) as wingbacks (defensively supported by the libero) to launch faster counter-attacks, a staple of Italian tactics - yet, he never denied the heart of his team relied on defense. He was also the first manager to collect credit for his teams' performances. Up to that time managers were more marginal figures in a team. All teams were known for their headline-grabbing individual players, exampled by such a star like Di Stéfano's Real Madrid, whereas Inter FC during the 60s is still referred to as Herrera's Inter.TitlesAltogether Helenio Herrera won 16 major titles in his coaching career.

(from the initials of his name) by Italian sports journalists (who recognized him as one of the finest coaches in Italian football history) because on occasion he would provocatively announce the results of Sunday's games and often his prediction turned out to be correct. He is unrelated with the less famous Heriberto Herrera, another football coach who directed Juventus and Inter in the same years.
