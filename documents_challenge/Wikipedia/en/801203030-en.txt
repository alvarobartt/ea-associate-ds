At the same time, she also appeared on the web site Bomis, posing clothed for a Ferrari giveaway contest.Around the same time that she shot the Penthouse photos, she transferred to University of California, San Diego as a junior transfer student intending to major in biochemistry and minor in English writing. However, she opted not to attend as she felt that the workload would not leave time for modeling; "I knew I could always come back to school, but I probably couldn't come back to modeling."In 2001, she played Monica Snatch in the movie Survivors Exposed, a parody of the Survivor television series. She also appeared on the TV dating show Shipmates (Episode dated November 16, 2001).Giovanni has appeared in bondage, fetish, amateur, glamour and artistic photography. Giovanni has worked extensively with Andrew Blake, appearing in Girlfriends, Aria, Blondes & Brunettes, Justine, Adriana and Naked Diva.
