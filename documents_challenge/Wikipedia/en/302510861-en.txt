He was the son of Alois II of Liechtenstein and his wife Countess Franziska Kinsky. Franz succeeded his older brother Johann II, as Prince of Liechtenstein in 1929.Franz I served as the Austro-Hungarian ambassador at the Court of Tsar Nicholas II in St. Petersburg between 1894 and 1899. As Prince of Liechtenstein, he continued the economic reforms initiated by his brother.Like his brother Johann II, Franz I had no children. His 1st cousin once removed Prince Aloys was named heir apparent, but Aloys removed himself from the line of succession in favor of his son, Franz Josef, in 1921.Franz I married Elisabeth von Gutmann, a Jewish woman from Vienna, on July 22, 1929.In March 1938 the elderly Franz I named Franz Josef the country's regent. Although he cited old age as his reason for abdicating, it is widely believed that it was because he had no desire to be on the throne if Germany invaded his small principality. Franz I died on July 25, 1938, and was formally succeeded by Franz Josef, who became Prince Franz Josef II.
