In mechanics, the virial theorem provides a general equation relating the average total kinetic energy, \left\langle T \right\rangle, of a stable system, bound by potential forces, with its average total potential energy, \left\langle V_ \right\rangle, where angle brackets represent the average of the enclosed quantity. Mathematically, the theorem states2 \left\langle T \right\rangle = -\sum_^ \left\langle \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ \right\rangle where F'''k represents the force on the kth particle, which is located at position '''rk''. The word "virial" derives from ''vis, the Latin word for "force" or "energy", and was given its technical definition by Clausius in 1870. Fritz Zwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to deduce the existence of unseen matter, what is now called dark matter.The significance of the virial theorem is that it allows the average total kinetic energy to be calculated even for very complicated systems that defy an exact solution, such as those considered in statistical mechanics; this average total kinetic energy is related to the temperature of the system by the equipartition theorem. However, the virial theorem does not depend on the notion of temperature and holds even for systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. The virial theorem has been generalized in various ways, most notably to a tensor form.If the force between any two particles of the system results from a potential energy V®=''αr n'' that is proportional to some power n'' of the inter-particle distance ''r, the virial theorem adopts a simple form2 \langle T \rangle = n \langle V_ \rangle. Thus, twice the average total kinetic energy \left\langle T \right\rangle equals n'' times the average total potential energy \left\langle V_ \right\rangle. Whereas ''V® represents the potential energy between two particles, VTOT represents the total potential energy of the system, i.e., the sum of the potential energy V® over all pairs of particles in the system. A common example of such a system is a star held together by its own gravity, where n equals -1. As another example of its many applications, the virial theorem has been used to derive the Chandrasekhar limit for the stability of white dwarf stars.Although the virial theorem depends on averaging the total kinetic and potential energies, the presentation here postpones the averaging to the last step. Patience will serve the reader.Definitions of the virial and its time derivativeFor a collection of N point particles, the scalar moment of inertia I about the origin is defined by the equationI = \sum_^ m_ \mathbf_^ = \sum_^ m_ r_^ where m''''k and r'''k represent the mass and position of the k''''th particle. The scalar '''virial G is defined by the equationG = \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ where p'''k is the momentum vector of the k''''th particle. Assuming that the masses are constant, the '''virial G is one-half the time derivative of this moment of inertiaG = \frac \frac = \sum_^ m_ \frac_ \cdot \mathbf_ = \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ In turn, the time derivative of the virial G can be written\frac = \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \frac_ + \sum_^ \frac_ \cdot \mathbf_= \sum_^ m_ \frac_ \cdot \frac_ + \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ or, more simply,\frac = 2 T + \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_. Here m_ is the mass of the k^ particle, \mathbf_ = \frac_ is the net force on that particle and T is the total kinetic energy of the systemT = \frac \sum_^ m_ v_^ = \frac \sum_^ m_ \frac_ \cdot \frac_. Connection with the potential energy between particlesThe total force \mathbf_ on particle k is the sum of all the forces from the other particles j in the system\mathbf_ = \sum_^ \mathbf_ where \mathbf_ is the force applied by particle j on particle k. Hence, the force term of the virial time derivative can be written\sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ = \sum_^ \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_. Since no particle acts on itself (i.e., \mathbf_ = 0 whenever j=k), we have\sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ = \sum_^ \sum_ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ + \sum_^ \sum_ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ = \sum_^ \sum_ \mathbf_ \cdot \left( \mathbf_ - \mathbf_ \right). where we have assumed that Newton's third law of motion holds, i.e., \mathbf_ = -\mathbf_ (equal and opposite reaction).It often happens that the forces can be derived from a potential energy V that is a function only of the distance r_ between the point particles j and k. Since the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, we have in this case\mathbf_ = -\nabla__ V =\frac \left( \frac_ - \mathbf_ \right),which is clearly equal and opposite to \mathbf_ = -\nabla__ V, the force applied by particle k on particle j, as may be confirmed by explicit calculation. Hence, the force term of the virial time derivative is\sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ = \sum_^ \sum_ \mathbf_ \cdot \left( \mathbf_ - \mathbf_ \right) =\sum_^ \sum_ \frac \frac_ - \mathbf_ \right)^2 =\sum_^ \sum_ \frac r_.Thus, we have\frac = 2 T + \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ = 2 T - \sum_^ \sum_ \frac r_ Special case of power-law forcesIn a common special case, the potential energy V between two particles is proportional to a power n'' of their distance ''rV(r_) = \alpha r_^, where the coefficient α and the exponent n are constants. In such cases, the force term of the virial time derivative is given by the equation\sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ =\sum_^ \sum_ \frac r_ = \sum_^ \sum_ n V(r_) = n V_ where V_ is the total potential energy of the systemV_ = \sum_^ \sum_ V(r_). Thus, we have\frac = 2 T + \sum_^ \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ = 2 T - n V_ For gravitating systems and also for electrostatic systems, the exponent n'' equals -1, giving '''Lagrange's identity'\frac = \frac \fracI = 2 T + V_ which was derived by Lagrange and extended by Jacobi.Time averaging and the virial theoremThe average of this derivative over a time \tau is defined as\left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ = \frac \int_^ \frac\,dt = \frac \int_^ dG = \frac, from which we obtain the exact equation\left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ = 2 \left\langle T \right\rangle_ + \sum_^ \left\langle \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ \right\rangle_. The virial theorem states that, if \left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ = 0, then2 \left\langle T \right\rangle_ = -\sum_^ \left\langle \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ \right\rangle_. There are many reasons why the average of the time derivative might vanish, i.e., \left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ = 0. One often-cited reason applies to stable bound systems, i.e., systems that hang together forever. In that case, the virial G^ is usually bounded between two extremes, G_\min and G_\max, and the average goes to zero in the limit of very long times \tau\lim_ \left| \left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ \right| = \lim_ \left| \frac \right| \le \lim_ \frac = 0. Even if the average of the time derivative \left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ \approx 0 is only approximately zero, the virial theorem holds to the same degree of approximation.For power-law forces with an exponent n, the general equation holds\langle T \rangle_ = -\frac \sum_^ \langle \mathbf_ \cdot \mathbf_ \rangle_ = \frac \langle V_ \rangle_. For gravitational attraction, n equals -1 and the average kinetic energy equals half of the average negative potential energy\langle T \rangle_ = -\frac \langle V_ \rangle_. This general result is useful for complex gravitating systems such as solar systems or galaxies.A simple application of the Virial theorem concerns galaxy clusters. If a region of space is unusually full of galaxies, it is safe to assume that they have been together for a long time, and the Virial theorem can be applied. Doppler measurements give lower bounds for their relative velocities, and the Virial theorem gives a lower bound for the total mass of the cluster, including any dark matter.The averaging need not be taken over time; an ensemble average can also be taken, with equivalent results.Although derived for classical mechanics, the virial theorem also holds for quantum mechanics (the quantum equivalent of the l.h.s. \left\langle \frac \right\rangle_ vanishes for energy eigenstates).Generalisations of the virial theoremLord Rayleigh published a generalization of the virial theorem in 1903. Henri Poincaré applied a form of the virial theorem in 1911 to the problem of determining cosmological stability. A variational form of the virial theorem was developed in 1945 by Ledoux. A tensor form of the virial theorem was developed by Parker, Chandrasekhar and Fermi. The following generalization of the virial theorem has been established by Pollard in 1964 for the case of the inverse square law: the statement 2\lim\limits__=\lim\limits__ is true if and only if \lim\limits_^I(\tau)=0. See:  and .Inclusion of electromagnetic fieldsThe virial theorem can be extended to include electric and magnetic fields. The result is\frac\fracI + \int_Vx_k\fracd^3r = 2(T+U) + W^E + W^M - \int x_k(p_+T_)dS_i, where I'' is the moment of inertia, ''G is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field, T'' is the kinetic energy of the "fluid", ''U is the random "thermal" energy of the particles, WE and WM are the electric and magnetic energy content of the volume considered. Finally, pik is the fluid-pressure tensor expressed in the local moving coordinate systemp_ = \Sigma n^\sigma m^\sigma \langle v_iv_k\rangle^\sigmaV_iV_k\Sigma m^\sigma n^\sigma, and Tik is the electromagnetic stress tensor,T_ = \left( \frac + \frac \right)\left( \varepsilon_0E_iE_k + \frac \right).A plasmoid is a finite configuration of magnetic fields and plasma. With the virial theorem it is easy to see that any such configuration will expand if not contained by external forces. In a finite configuration without pressure-bearing walls or magnetic coils, the surface integral will vanish. Since all the other terms on the right hand side are positive, the acceleration of the moment of inertia will also be positive. It is also easy to estimate the expansion time τ. If a total mass M'' is confined within a radius ''R, then the moment of inertia is roughly MR2, and the left hand side of the virial theorem is MR2/τ2. The terms on the right hand side add up to about pR3, where p is the larger of the plasma pressure or the magnetic pressure. Equating these two terms and solving for τ, we find\tau\,\sim R/c_s,where cs is the speed of the ion acoustic wave (or the Alfven wave, if the magnetic pressure is higher than the plasma pressure). Thus the lifetime of a plasmoid is expected to be on the order of the acoustic (or Alfven) transit time.Virial radiusIn astronomy, the term virial radius is sometimes used to refer to the radius of a sphere, centered on a galaxy or a galaxy cluster, within which the average density is greater, by a specified factor, than the critical density \rho_=\frac. (Here, H'' is the Hubble parameter and ''G is the gravitational constant.) A common choice for the factor is 200, in which case the virial radius is designated as r_.See alsoVirial stressEquipartition theoremReferencesAdditional readingExternal linksThe Virial Theorem at MathPagesCategory:Physics theorems Category:Dynamics Category:Solid mechanics Category:Fundamental physics conceptsde:Virialsatz es:Teorema de virial fr:Théorème du viriel ko:비리얼 정리 it:Teorema del viriale nl:Viriaaltheorema ja:ビリアル定理 pl:Twierdzenie o wiriale pt:Teorema do virial ru:Вириал fi:Viriaaliteoreema zh:维里定理
