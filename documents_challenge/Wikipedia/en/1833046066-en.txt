  A light-year or light year (symbol: ly) is a unit of length, equal to just under ten trillion kilometres. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (which is the body which has the jurisdictional authority to promulgate the definition), a light-year is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year.Numerical valueA light-year is equal to:exactly 9,460,730,472,580.8 km (about 10&nbsp;Pm)about 5,878,625,373,183.61 international milesabout 63,241 astronomical unitsabout 0.3066 parsecsThe figures above are based on a Julian year (not Gregorian year) of exactly 365.25 days (each of exactly 86,400 SI seconds, totalling 31,557,600 seconds) as defined by the IAU.IAU Recommendations concerning UnitsThe light-year is often used to measure distances to stars. In astronomy, the preferred unit of measurement for such distances is the parsec, which is defined as the distance at which an object will appear to move one arcsecond of parallax when the observer moves one astronomical unit perpendicular to the line of sight to the observer. This is equal to approximately 3.26 light-years. The parsec is preferred because it can be more easily derived from, and compared with, observational data. However, outside scientific circles, the term light-year is more widely used.Definitions on the webInternet search engines base their light-years on the 1900.0 mean tropical year, specified in the definition of the ephemeris second as 31,556,925.9747 sEphemeris second via Leap seconds at the United States Naval Observatory (12 significant digits), but round the number of metres to fewer significant digits. Microsoft's Live Search rounds to ten digits, Google and AOL round to eight digits, Ask.com rounds to seven digits, while Yahoo rounds to only five digits. All of these are smaller than the IAU definition.Distances in light-yearsDistances measured in fractions of a light-year usually involve objects within a star system. Distances measured in light-years include distances between nearby stars, such as those in the same spiral arm or globular cluster.One kilolight-year, abbreviated "kly", is one thousand light-years, or about 307 parsecs. Kilolight-years are typically used to measure distances between parts of a galaxy.One megalight-year, abbreviated "Mly", is one million light-years, or about 306,600 parsecs. Megalight-years are typically used to measure distances between neighboring galaxies and galaxy clusters.One gigalight-year, abbreviation "Gly", is one billion light-years — one of the largest distance measures used. One gigalight-year is about 306.6 million parsecs. Gigalight-years are typically used to measure distances to supergalactic structures, including quasars and the Great Wall.+'List of orders of magnitude for length'Factor (ly)ValueItem10-9-9 lyReflected sunlight from the Moon's surface takes 1.2-1.3 seconds to travel the distance to the Earth's surface.
