Starring Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, and Oscar Levant, the film is set in Paris, and was directed by Vincente Minnelli from a script by Alan Jay Lerner. The music is by George Gershwin, with lyrics by his brother Ira, with additional music by Saul Chaplin, the music director.The story of the film is interspersed with show-stopping dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and set to popular Gershwin tunes. Songs and music include "I Got Rhythm," "I'll Build A Stairway to Paradise," "'S Wonderful," and "Our Love is Here to Stay". The climax is "The American in Paris" ballet, an 18 minute dance featuring Kelly and Caron set to Gershwin's An American in Paris. The ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars, a staggering sum at the time.__TOC__ as Jerry Mulligan]]PlotJerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is an exuberant American expatriate in Paris trying to make a reputation as a painter. His friend Adam (Oscar Levant) is a struggling concert pianist who's a long time associate of a famous French singer, Henri Baurel (Georges Guétary). A lonely society woman, Milo Roberts (Nina Foch) takes Jerry under her wing and supports him, but is interested in more than his art. Jerry remains oblivious to her feelings, and falls in love with Lise (Leslie Caron), a French girl he meets at a restaurant. Lise loves him as well, but she is already in a relationship with Henri, whom she feels indebted to for having saved her family during World War II.At a raucous masked ball, with everyone in black-and-white costumes, Milo learns that Jerry is not interested in her, Jerry learns that Lise is in love with him, but is marrying Henri the next day, and Henri overhears their conversation. When Henri drives Lise away, Jerry daydreams about being with her all over Paris, his reverie broken by a car horn, the sound of Henri bringing Lise back to him.CastGene Kelly as Jerry MulliganLeslie Caron as Lise BouvierOscar Levant as Adam CookGeorges Guétary as Henri "Hank" BaurelNina Foch as Milo RobertsCast notesHayden Rorke, best known for playing "Dr. Bellows" on the TV series I Dream of Jeanie has a small part as a friend of Nina Foch's character.Noel Neill, later to portray "Lois Lane" on the TV series The Adventures of Superman, has a small role as an American art student who tries to criticize Jerry Mulligan's paintings.SoundtrackProductionThe film was shot on Hollywood sets, so it features some quirks in the occasional French dialogue. Notably, near the beginning of the I Got Rhythm number, one of the "French" kids says Jerry, parle anglais 'à nous''', which sounds rather curious. In the French soundtrack, which switches to the original sound for the duration of the songs, the ''à nous is masked through a plop sound, to make the sentence more palatable.Hollywood movies set in France seldom used location shooting or native speakers. However, great care was sometimes put into reproducing Paris surroundings, as in An American in Paris or Irma La Douce. Ironically, a lot of older French Paris-based movies were studio work as well and the same art directors (e.g. Alexandre Trauner) were sometimes working on both sides of the ocean.AwardsACADEMY AWARDS WinsAcademy Award for Best Picture — Arthur Freed, producerAcademy Award for Best Art — Set Decoration, Color — E.
