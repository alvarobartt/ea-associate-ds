His three ships and crew of 70 men sailed from Sanlucar de Barrameda on October 8, 1515. He followed the eastern coast as far as the mouth of the Río de la Plata. He reached and named the Río de la Plata in 1516, sailing up river to the confluence of the Uruguay River and Paraná River with two officers and seven men.The little party had not proceeded far when they were attacked by local Charrua. Surviving crew members reported Díaz de Solís and most of the other men were killed and cannibalized, thus putting the expedition to an end. Some sources believe that Díaz de Solís was killed in a mutiny and the story about being killed and cannibalized was forged by his crew. His brother-in-law, Francisco de Torres, took charge of the ships and returned to Spain.See alsoList of explorersExplorationsReferences Davies, Arthur : "The First Discovery and Exploration of the Amazon in 1498-99," Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers), No. 22.
