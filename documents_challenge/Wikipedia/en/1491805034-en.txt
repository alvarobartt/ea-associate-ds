Prison Break features a serialized story structure, similar to that of its companion show during the first season, 24. The first three seasons of the series were primarily filmed outside of Hollywood; the first season was shot in and around Chicago, with the primary location being the then-recently decommissioned Joliet Prison while the second and third seasons were filmed mainly in small towns around Dallas. The fourth season is being filmed in Los Angeles.Season synopsisSeason 1 consists of 22 episodes and was originally aired from August 29, 2005 to May 15, 2006 on the Fox Network in the United States. Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) is accused of the murder of Terrence Steadman (Jeff Perry), the brother of the Vice President of the United States. With strong evidence supporting the charges against him, Lincoln is sentenced to death and is sent to the Fox River State Penitentiary to await execution. Lincoln's brother, brilliant structural engineer Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), is convinced of Lincoln's innocence and formulates an escape plan. He commits a robbery in order to be incarcerated at Fox River himself, as he works against time to overcome various obstacles and make the right connections among the inmates and prison staff to successfully break his brother out. The brothers are aided by their lifelong friend Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney), who begins to investigate the conspiracy that put Lincoln in jail. However, they are hindered by covert agents, who belong to an organization known as The Company. The Company was responsible for framing Lincoln and it is not yet known why. The brothers, along with six other inmates, Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), T-Bag (Robert Knepper), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), Tweener (Lane Garrison), Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), and Haywire (Silas Weir Mitchell) who come to be known as the Fox River Eight finally escape in the season finale.Season 2 consists of 22 episodes and was originally aired from August 21, 2006 to April 2, 2007 on the Fox Network in the United States. It begins eight hours after the escape, focusing mainly on the escapees. Series creator Paul Scheuring describes the second season as "The Fugitive times eight" and likens it to the "second half of The Great Escape".Dallas Welcomes Hit Television Series. Dallas Film Commission. May 15, 2006. Retrieved on January 17, 2007. The fugitives split up and journey to locations across the country with the authorities close behind them as they each pursue their individual goals. Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) gets fired from the prison where he worked as a guard in season 1 and chases after the inmates himself for the reward money . Several of the escapees reunite in search of a large cache of money buried long ago by another prisoner. T-Bag manages to escape with the money, as the brothers spend the rest of the season tracking him down, both for the money which they need to escape the country, and because Scofield feels responsible for releasing the murderer.Federal agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) is assigned to track down and capture the eight fugitives, but is revealed himself to be working for The Company; The group wants all eight men - especially Lincoln - dead. Several of the escapees are killed or recaptured, but the brothers make it to Panama. In the season finale, the testimony of a former CIA agent, who used to work for the Company-controlled President, exonerates Lincoln while Michael, T-Bag and Mahone are arrested by the Panamanian authorities and are imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona where they find Bellick who had been arrested earlier in the season.Season 3 consists of 13 episodes after being cut from 22 due to the WGA strike and was originally aired from September 17, 2007 to February 18, 2008 on the Fox Network in the United States. The season follows both Michael inside Sona and Lincoln on the outside. Sona is a prison that has been run by the inmates and guarded only from the outside since a riot the year before. Burrows is quickly contacted by The Company who have kidnapped his son LJ (Marshall Allman) and Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), the woman Michael loves, and is told that they want Scofield to break James Whistler (Chris Vance) out of Sona. The season follows Michael and Whistler's trials in formulating an escape plan, as Michael has to deal with extreme tension and as Lincoln deals with the Company's operative Gretchen Morgan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Sucre gets a job at the prison to aid Michael in his escape plan.When Michael fails to meet their deadline and Lincoln attempts a double-cross, Morgan "beheads Sara" and sends Lincoln the head as a warning. As the season ends, the pair manage to escape along with Mahone leaving behind several accomplices including T-Bag and Bellick. Sucre's identity is discovered by a prison guard and is thrown into Sona just after the escape. LJ is traded for Whistler and Michael is out for revenge against Gretchen for "Sara's death".Season 4 premiered on September 1, 2008 and follows on from Season 3. Michael seeks revenge for Sara's death and finds out that she is alive and that the head given to Lincoln was from someone else. Michael also learns the truth about Whistler, that he has secretly been working alongside Mahone to take down the Company. Whistler's life is taken shortly after this by a Company Operative. It is learned that the inmates rioted at Sona and Bellick, T-Bag and Sucre escaped during the chaos. Donald Self (Michael Rapaport), a Department of Homeland Security agent, recruits Michael and Lincoln as well as Sucre, Bellick (Wade Williams) and Mahone for their help to bring down the Company in exchange for their freedom. Also joining the group are Sara, who escaped from Gretchen which resulted in Gretchen's own captivity by the Company, having failed to secure a valuable item, and Roland (James Hiroyuki Liao), a hacker who was assigned to help them after getting arrested for identity theft. Together, they devise a plan to retrieve data from the Company that will help to destroy the Company. In the meantime, Wyatt (Cress Williams), an agent from the Company, attempts to track Michael and Lincoln down and T-Bag heads North to the US with the "Birds" book in his possesion. He is in the process of stealing Whistler's plan.Cast and characters[[Image:pb cast season1.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Season 1 promotional photograph of the Prison Break cast.]] Prison Break maintains an ensemble cast of ten or more actors for each season along with many recurring guest stars. The first season's regularly appearing characters include characters that were based in Chicago or at Fox River State Penitentiary. The second season contains most of the first season's cast with the addition of a new major character, an FBI agent whose job is to track down the eight escaped prisoners from Fox River. The third season introduces four new characters; two of whom are prisoners at Penitenciaría Federal de Sona (Sona Federal Penitentiary). Most of the changes in the cast have been due to character deaths. Series creator, Paul Scheuring, explains that killing off major characters "makes the audience that much more fearful for our protagonists" and that "it actually does help us in terms of reducing story lines".Wyatt, Edward, "In 'Prison Break,' an Actor's Job Is Never Safe", The New York Times, August 20, 2006. Retrieved on September 13, 2007. The two protagonists of the series, Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield, are the only characters to have appeared in every episode of the series.Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a high school dropout and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged with the murder of Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. At first, Scheuring thought Purcell was "too much of a pretty boy" after he went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell won the role and arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield: Michael is Lincoln's brother and worked as a structural engineer before devoting full-time to his brother's case. In order to save his brother's life, Michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. In an interview, Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role "would come in playing mysterious, but it was so cheesy and false."Australian Associated Press, Prison Break success shocks creator, The Sydney Morning Herald, January 27, 2006.

He is forced into hiding after he becomes the target of the people who want Lincoln dead.Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre develops a friendship with Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. He becomes Michael and Lincoln's ally, and provides comic relief to the show. His character's story focuses mainly on his wish to reunite with his girlfriend. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's first thought was that it was "one of those failed pilots that the network didn't really want" since most of the series pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he doesn't like to read, Nolasco was amazed that the script was a "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favourite choice.

He appears in the series as a major character in the first and second seasons.Wade Williams as Brad Bellick: Appearing in all four seasons, Bellick was introduced as the captain of Fox River's correctional officers. After reading the pilot script, Williams initially did not want to portray the role of Bellick because the character was "horrible and despicable". His reluctance stemmed from being the father of a four-year-old daughter. However, his manager persuaded him to audition for the role and Williams landed the role of Bellick.Sarah Wayne Callies as Sara Tancredi: Sara was introduced as a doctor working at Fox River and the daughter of the Governor of the state of Illinois, who is linked into the plot that brings Lincoln to Fox River.

Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series.Goldman, E., "Paley Fest: Prison Break", IGN. March 13, 2007. Retrieved on March 23, 2007. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds.
