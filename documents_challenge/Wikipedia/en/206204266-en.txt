As do other form of entertainment, board games can represent nearly any subject.There are many different types and styles of board games, including those, at the most-basic level, that that have no inherent theme—such as Checkers—''as well as more-complicated games with definite subjects, or even narratives, like ''[[Clue (board game)|Clue]].HistoryBoard games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history; some even pre-date literacy skill development in the earliest civilizations.  A number of important historical sites, artifacts and documents exist which shed light on early board games. Some of these include:), and roughly contemporary with Senet.|300px]] .|300px]]The Jiroft civilization game boardsSenet has been found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively. Senet is the oldest board game known to have existed, and was pictured in a fresco found in Merknera's tomb (3300-2700 BC).[http://www.hrejsi.cz/clanky/dama1.html Okno do svita deskovych her]Mehen is another ancient board game from Predynastic Egypt.Go is an ancient strategic board game originating in ChinaPatolli is a board game originating in Mesoamerica, and was played by the ancient Mayans.The Royal Tombs of Ur contained, among others, the Royal Game of Ur.

Many board games are now available as computer games, which can include the computer itself as one of several players, or as sole opponent. The rise of computer use is one of the reasons said to have led to a relative decline in board games.  Many board games can now be played online against a computer and/or other players. Some websites allow play in real time and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use email to notify the players after each move (see the links at the end of this article). Some board games make use of components in addition to—or instead of—a board and playing pieces. Some games use CDs, video cassettes, and, more recently, DVDs in accompaniment to the game. PsychologyWhile there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., chess, Go, mancala), less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk. . Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible precisely to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot, William Chase, and Herbert Simon have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing. This seems to be the case in other traditional games such as Go and Oware (a type of mancala game), but data are lacking with regard to contemporary board games. Luck, strategy and diplomacy One way to categorize board games is to distinguish those based primarily upon luck from those that involve significant strategy. Some games, such as chess, are entirely deterministic, relying only on the strategy element for their interest. Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with games such as Sorry!, Candy Land and Chutes and ladders having virtually no decisions to be made. Most board games involve both luck and strategy. A player may be hampered by a few poor rolls of the dice in Risk or Monopoly, but over many games a player with a superior strategy will win more often. While some purists consider luck to not be a desirable component of a game, others counter that elements of luck can make for far more diverse and multi-faceted strategies as concepts such as expected value and risk management must be considered.The third important factor in a game is diplomacy, or players making deals with each other. A game of solitaire, for obvious reasons, has no player interaction. Two player games usually do not have diplomacy, with Lord of the Rings being a notable exception where players compete against an automatic opponent (see cooperative games). Thus, this generally applies only to games played with three or more people. An important facet of Settlers of Catan, for example, is convincing people to trade with you rather than with other players. In Risk, one example of diplomacy's effectiveness is when two or more players team up against others. Easy diplomacy consists of convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. Difficult diplomacy (such as in the aptly named game Diplomacy) consists of making elaborate plans together, with possibility of betrayal.Luck is introduced to a game by a number of methods. The most popular is using dice, generally six-sided. These can determine everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in Monopoly, to how their forces fare in battle, such as in Risk, or which resources a player gains, such as in Settlers of Catan. Other games such as Sorry! use a deck of special cards that, when shuffled, create randomness. Scrabble does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a person gets. German-style board games are notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many North American board games.Common termstokens, or meeples]] Although many board games have a jargon all their own, there is a generalized terminology to describe concepts applicable to basic game mechanics and attributes common to nearly all board games.Game board (or board)&mdash;the (usually quadrilateral) surface on which one plays a board game; the namesake of the board game, gameboards are a necessary and sufficient condition of the genre.Game piece (or counter or token or bit)&mdash;a player's representative on the game board. Each player may control one or more game pieces. In some games that involve commanding multiple game pieces, such as chess, certain pieces have unique designations and capabilities within the parameters of the game; in others, such as Go, all pieces controlled by a player have the same essential capabilities. In some games, pieces may not represent or belong to a particular player.Jump&mdash;to bypass one or more game pieces and/or spaces. Depending on the context, jumping may also involve capturing or conquering an opponent's game piece. (See also: Game mechanic: capture)Space (or square)&mdash;a physical unit of progress on a gameboard delimited by a distinct border. (See also: Game mechanic: Movement)Hex In hexagon-based board games, this is the common term for a standard space on the board. This is most often used in war games.CategoriesThere are a number of different categories that board games can be broken up into. The following is a list of some of the most common:Abstract strategy games like chess, checkers, Arimaa, irensei or goGerman-style board games, or Eurogames, like The Settlers of Catan or Puerto RicoRace games like parchisi or backgammonRoll-and-move games, like Monopoly or LifeTrivia games, like Trivial PursuitWord games, like ScrabbleWargames, ranging from Risk to Advanced Squad LeaderFurther readingRollefson, Gary O., "A Neolithic Game Board from Ain Ghazal, Jordan,"Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 286.
