Oliaros) is an island in the island group Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, in the modern eparchy of Naxos, separated by a strait (about 1-½ miles wide at the narrowest point) from the west coast of Paros: the boat trip is just ten minutes from Pounta, a little port on Paros which can be reached by bus or taxi, and about twenty minutes from the main port in Paros, Parikia. The island's seashore is  long, but it's not big in population: there were 1,037 residents in Antiparos at the 2001 census. Most live in Kastro, a village on the north coast, and are employed in agriculture and fishing. The Community of Antiparos includes several uninhabited nearby islands, the largest of which are Despotiko and Stroggyli. Their total land area is 45.182 km².GeographyThe largest tourist attraction on the island of Antiparos is a stalactite cavern on the south coast, which is reached by a narrow passage broken by two steep and dangerous descents which are accomplished by the aid of rope-ladders. The grotto itself, which is about 150 feet by 100, and 50 feet high (not all can be seen from any part, and probably some portions are still unexplored), shows many remarkable examples of stalactite formations and incrustations of dazzling brilliance. It is not mentioned by ancient writers; there is, however, in the entrance of the cavern an inscription recording the names of visitors in ancient times. The first traveller of modern times whose visit is recorded was the marquis de Nointel (ambassador of Louis XIV to the Porte) who descended it with a numerous suite and held high mass there on Christmas day 1673. There are two beaches called Psaraliki.Early HistoryPrehistoric finds have been made in Antiparos, with documentation commencing at least as early as 1885.James Theodore Bent, The Cyclades, Or, Life Among the Insular Greeks, 1885, Longmans, Green, and Co., 501 pages Early finds include worked obsidian, marble plates and crude marble figures. C. Michael Hogan notes that bottle neck suspension pots resembling finds from Middle Minoan Knossos have been found at Antiparos.[http://letmespeaktothedriver.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, Knossos Fieldnotes, The Modern Antiquarian (2007)]Alternative CultureThe island, and especially the camp site area, was a popular location in the late 1980s for its "Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll" lifestyle. The beach outside the camp is an unofficial nude beachReferencesNotesJ.
