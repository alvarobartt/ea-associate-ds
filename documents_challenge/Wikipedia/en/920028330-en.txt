The Kattegat (Danish), or Kattegatt (Swedish) is a sea area bounded by Jutland (Denmark and extreme north Germany), and Scania, Halland and Bohuslän (Sweden). The Baltic Sea drains into the Kattegat through the Oresund and the Danish Straits. The Kattegat is a continuation of the Skagerrak and may be seen as either a bay of the Baltic Sea, a bay of the North Sea, or, in traditional Scandinavian usage, none of these.GeographyAccording to the definition established in a 1932 convention signed by Denmark, Norway and Sweden (registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series 199 - 1933), the northern boundary between Kattegat and Skagerrak is found at the northernmost point of Skagen on Jutland and the southern boundary towards Oresund is found at the tip of Kullen Peninsula in Scania.Convention No 3210. League of Nations Treaty Series 199, 1933. Retrieved 15 April 2008.Waterways that drain into the Kattegat are the rivers of Göta älv at Gothenburg, together with the Lagan, Nissan, Ätran and Viskan from the province of Halland on the Swedish side, and the river of Gudenå from Jutland, in Denmark.The main islands of the Kattegat are Samsø, Læsø and Anholt, where the latter two, due to their dry summer climate, are referred to as the Danish desert belt.A number of noteworthy coastal areas abut the Kattegat, including the Kullaberg Nature Reserve in Scania, Sweden, which contains a number of rare species and a scenic rocky shore, the town of Mölle, which has a picturesque harbour and views into the Kullaberg, and Skagen at the northern tip of Denmark.Currently, a proposed bridge from Jutland to Zealand, across the southern part of Kattegat is under political consideration in Denmark.EtymologyAccording to Den Store Danske Encyklopædi and Nudansk Ordbog, the name derives from the Dutch words Kat (cat) and Gat (hole). It refers to late medieval navigation jargon, when captains of the Hanseatic trading fleets would compare the Danish Straits to a hole so narrow that even a cat would have difficulty squeezing its way through on account of the many reefs and shallow waters.Den Store Danske Encyklopædi (2004), CD-rom edition, Copenhagen: Gyldendal, entry Kattegat.Nudansk Ordbog (1993), 15th edition, 2nd reprint, Copenhagen: Politikens Forlag, entry Kattegat. At one point, the passable waters were a mere 3.84 kilometers (2.38 miles) wide.An archaic name for both the Skagerrak and Kattegat was the Norwegian Sea or Jutland Sea (Knýtlinga saga mentions the name Jótlandshaf). The name of the Copenhagen street Kattesundet is derived from same root.References In-line: Category:Landforms of Denmark Category:Straits of Denmark Category:Straits of Swedenaf:Kattegat ar:كاتيغات br:Kattegat bg:Категат ca:Kattegat cs:Kattegat da:Kattegat de:Kattegat et:Kattegat el:Κάτεγατ es:Kattegat eo:Kategato eu:Kattegat fr:Cattégat gl:Kattegat ko:카테가트 해협 id:Teluk Kattegat is:Kattegat it:Kattegat sw:Kattegat ku:Kattegat lt:Kategatas hu:Kattegat nl:Kattegat ja:カテガット海峡 no:Kattegat nn:Kattegat pl:Kattegat pt:Kattegat ru:Каттегат simple:Kattegat sk:Kattegat sl:Kattegat sr:Категат fi:Kattegat sv:Kattegatt vi:Kattegat uk:Каттегат zh:卡特加特海峡
