He enjoyed success there, and was picked up by Ajax Amsterdam in 2000. However, injury and inexperience combined to keep him out of a starting role, and he was loaned to Dinamo Bucureşti for 2001-2002.Upon his return to Ajax, though, he was the team's primary goalkeeper. Although he struggled with injuries from time to time, he played well when available in both the Dutch League and the Champions League.In January 2006, Lobonţ was sold from Ajax to Italian Serie A club Fiorentina, which was looking for a goalkeeper after the injury of Sebastien Frey. Although he played particularly well, Frey's return meant that he would spend most of the time as a substitute. Because he had also lost his place in the Romanian national team, Lobonţ made a surprise move to Dinamo Bucureşti in the winter of 2006 in order to help them win Liga I and qualify for the Champions League.He is known for organizing the defense loudly, communicating a lot with the outfield players and for very predictable press statements.International careerLobonţ plays an important part of the Romanian national team, earning over 60 caps, his first in 1998. He was part of his country's Euro 2000 and 2008 squads.He turned in a particularly strong performance in Romania's group stage game in Euro 2008 against world champions Italy, saving numerous well-placed shots and keeping his team's hopes alive with a 1-1 draw.External linksOfficial websiteDinamo Bucharest's official websiteFCDinamo.net profileromaniansoccer.ro profileUEFA.com profileAjax profile   Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Romanian footballers Category:Rapid Bucureşti players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:Dinamo Bucureşti players Category:ACF Fiorentina players Category:Serie A players Category:UEFA Euro 2000 players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:Football (soccer) goalkeepers Category:People from Hunedoara Category:Romania international footballers Category:Romanian expatriate footballers Category:Liga I players Category:Eredivisie playersar:بوغدان لوبونت cs:Bogdan Lobonţ de:Bogdan Lobonţ es:Bogdan Lobonţ fr:Bogdan Lobonţ id:Bogdan Lobonţ it:Bogdan Lobonţ lt:Bogdan Lobonţ hu:Bogdan Lobonţ mr:बोग्दान लोबोंटा nl:Bogdan Lobonţ ja:ボグダン・ロボンツ pl:Bogdan Lobonţ pt:Bogdan Lobonţ ro:Bogdan Lobonţ ru:Лобонц, Богдан sk:Bogdan Lobonţ fi:Bogdan Lobonţ tr:Bogdan Lobonţ
