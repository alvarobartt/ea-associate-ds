Chase lives with her mother Cathy Chase and was raised in Albany, Oregon, before moving to Los Angeles, California to pursue her career (although she does still spend much of her time in Albany). She now has a younger brother, Cade. She wanted to perform from a very early age and began singing and dancing in her hometown and other local areas at community events and shows. One of the factors which inspired her was watching videos of Barney &amp; Friends when she was 4 years old. "I wanted to be like them, the kids on the video," she later said. Her mother then entered her in a Little Miss America Pageant where Chase won the national vocal competition. Following her success, Chase was then signed by an agent who specialised in commercials and at the age of 7, she appeared in a Campbells Soup advertisement. In 1998, she landed a starring role as a child member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a musical theatre production called Utah!.Acting careerChase's big break came later in 2002 when she won the lead role as the voice of a Hawaiian girl, Lilo Pelekai, in the Disney animated feature, Lilo &amp; Stitch. The film concerns how Lilo befriends a strange and destructive blue alien whom she calls "Stitch" and how she tries to teach him how to behave using Elvis Presley music as exemplars. The message conveyed throughout the film is essentially that families must remain united, that there is an innate goodness in all children, that people should take pride in their own culture, and the importance of good behaviour. For her performance, Chase would go on to win an Annie Award for it in 2003 and star in the follow up TV series, Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series.In 2001, Chase won the role as the voice of the lead character, Chihiro Ogino, a 10 year old Japanese girl, in the American dub of the animated Japanese feature, Spirited Away.Thill, Scott (20 September 2002).
