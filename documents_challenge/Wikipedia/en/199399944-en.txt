He studied at Berlin University, where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1825, his thesis being an analytical discussion of the theory of fractions. In 1827 he became extraordinary and in 1829 ordinary professor of mathematics at Königsberg University, and this chair he filled until 1842.Jacobi suffered a breakdown from overwork in 1843. He then visited Italy for a few months to regain his health. On his return he moved to Berlin, where he lived as a royal pensioner until his death. During the Revolution of 1848 Jacobi was politically involved and unsuccessfully presented his parliamentary candidature on behalf of a Liberal club. This led, after the suppression of the revolution, to his royal grant being cut off - but his fame and reputation were such that it was soon resumed.Jacobi is buried at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin, the Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (61 Baruther Street). His grave is close to that of Johann Encke, the astronomer.The Jacobi crater, on the Moon, is named after him.Scientific contributionsJacobi wrote the classic treatise (1829) on elliptic functions, of great importance in mathematical physics, because of the need to "integrate second order kinetic energy equations". The motion equations in rotational form are integrable only for the three cases of the pendulum, the symmetric top in a gravitational field, and a freely spinning body, wherein solutions are in terms of elliptic functions. See Jacobi's elliptic functions.Jacobi was also the first mathematician to apply elliptic functions to number theory, for example, proving the 2 square and four-square theorems of Pierre de Fermat. He also proved similar results for 6 and 8 squares. The Jacobi theta functions, so frequently applied in the study of hypergeometric series, were named in his honor.He proved the functional equation for the theta function.He proved the Jacobi triple product formula and many other results in q-series.He gave new proofs of quadratic reciprocity, made contributions to higher reciprocity laws, investigated continued fractions and invented Jacobi sums.In 1841 he reintroduced the partial derivative ∂ notation of Legendre, which was to become standard.His investigations in elliptic functions, the theory of which he established upon quite a new basis, and more particularly his development of the theta function, as given in his great treatise Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum (1829), and in later papers in Crelle's Journal, constitute his grandest analytical discoveries. Second in importance only to these are his researches in differential equations, notably the theory of the last multiplier, which is fully treated in his Vorlesungen über Dynamik, edited by Alfred Clebsch (1866).It was in analytical development that Jacobi’s peculiar power mainly lay, and he made many important contributions of this kind to other departments of mathematics, as a glance at the long list of papers that were published by him in Crelle’s Journal and elsewhere from 1826 onwards will sufficiently indicate. He was one of the early founders of the theory of determinants; in particular, he invented the functional determinant formed of the n''² differential coefficients of ''n given functions of n independent variables, which now bears his name (Jacobian), and which has played an important part in many analytical investigations.In his 1835 paper, Jacobi proved the following:If a univariate single-value function is periodic, then the ratio of the periods cannot be a real number, and that such a function cannot have more than two periods.Jacobi reduced the general quintic equation to the form,x^5 - 10 q^2x = p.\,Valuable also are his papers on Abelian transcendents, and his investigations in the theory of numbers, in which latter department he mainly supplements the labours of K. F. Gauss.The planetary theory and other particular dynamical problems likewise occupied his attention from time to time. While contributing to celestial mechanics, Jacobi (1836) introduced the Jacobi integral for a sidereal coordinate system.He left a vast store of manuscripts, portions of which have been published at intervals in Crelle's Journal. His other works include Comnienlatio de transformatione integralis duplicis indefiniti in formam simpliciorem (1832), Canon arithmeticus (1839), and Opuscula mathematica (1846&ndash;1857). His Gesammelte Werke (1881&ndash;1891) were published by the Berlin Academy. Perhaps his most publicized work is Hamilton-Jacobi theory in rational mechanics.Students of vector theory often encounter the Jacobi identity, those studying differential equations often encounter the Jacobian determinant, and those working in number theory and cryptography use the Jacobi symbol.The phrase 'Invert, always invert,' is associated with Jacobi for he believed that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backwards.The solution of the Jacobi inversion problem for the hyperelliptic Abel map by Weierstrass in 1854 required the introduction of the hyperlliptic theta function and later the general Riemann theta function for algebraic curves of arbitrary genus. The complex torus associated to a genus  g  algebraic curve, obtained by quotienting  ^g  by the lattice of periods is referred to as the Jacobian or the Jacobi variety.See alsoJacobianJacobi identityJacobi's formulaJacobi symbolJacobi integralJacobi fieldJacobi polynomialsCarathéodory-Jacobi-Lie theoremJacobi methodJacobi lawsCitationsReferencesExternal linksCarl Gustav Jacob Jacobi   Category:19th century mathematicians Category:Converts from Judaism to Christianity Category:Differential geometers Category:German mathematicians Category:German Jews Category:Number theorists Category:People from Potsdam Category:People from the Margraviate of Brandenburg Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:University of Königsberg faculty Category:Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciencesbn:কার্ল গুস্তাফ ইয়াকপ ইয়াকবি ca:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi da:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi de:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi es:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi fa:کارل گوستاو ژاکوب ژاکوبی fr:Charles Gustave Jacob Jacobi is:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi it:Carl Jacobi he:קרל גוסטב יעקב יעקבי ka:კარლ გუსტავ იაკობ იაკობი ht:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi nl:Carl Jacobi ja:カール・グスタフ・ヤコブ・ヤコビ la:Carolus Gustavus Iacobus Jacobi no:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi pms:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi pl:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi pt:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi ro:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi ru:Якоби, Карл Густав Якоб sl:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi fi:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi sv:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi vi:Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi tr:Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi zh:卡爾·雅可比
