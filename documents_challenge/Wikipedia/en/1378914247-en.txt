In Irish mythology, Danu (Old Irish) or Dana (the Modern Gaelic and Scottish form) was the mother goddess of the Tuatha Dé Danann (peoples of the goddess Danu). The genitive is Danann (as in Tuatha Dé Danann), and the dative Danainn.Little is recorded about her as an individual. Some scholars believe Danu and Anu (also Ana) are the same deity, while others state that the two are separate individuals. Danu's Welsh equivalent is Dôn.MacKillop, James (1998) Dictionary of Celtic Mythology. Oxford: Oxford University Press ISBN 0192801201 pp.16, 128Antiquity of her recognitionBased on the evidence of place-names, such as the river Danube (), Dniestr, Dniepr and Don, Danu may have been worshiped throughout the Celtic world. Indeed, the presence of a goddess named Danu in Hindu mythology, associated with water and mother of a race of Asuras called the Danavas, may indicate a very ancient Proto-Indo-European origin for this figure.Etymology of the nameKöblerKöbler, Gerhard, (2000).
