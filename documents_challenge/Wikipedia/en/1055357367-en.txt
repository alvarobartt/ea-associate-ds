Due to the Faroe Islands' rather anomalous status, the airport is not fully subject to the rules of the European Union. It is the main operating base for Faroese national airline Atlantic Airways and, for a short period, during 2006, the low cost airline FaroeJet.HistoryThe airport was built by British Royal Engineers during World War II on the island of Vágar. The site was chosen mainly because it was hard to see from the surrounding waters and any potential German warship. (See British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II).TodaySince 2002 Vágar has had a toll road connection via a tunnel to the neighbouring island of Streymoy, upon which the Faroese capital Tórshavn is situated.On May 1st, 2007, the airport was handed over to Faroese control by the Danish Civil Aviation Authority.Statens Luftfartsvæsen: Færøerne overtager Vagar Lufthavn There are proposals to expand the airport and lengthen the runway.A number of domestic Faroese destinations can be reached from Vágar by the Atlantic Airways helicopter service. International destinations include Copenhagen, Aalborg and Billund in Denmark, Reykjavík in Iceland, Aberdeen, London and Sumburgh (Shetland) in the United Kingdom, and Oslo and Stavanger in Norway. At present, due to the short length of the runway, it has transverse grooves to improve braking action. Furthermore, emergency turn-off areas, close to each end of the runway, with broken stones have been established. Damage to aircraft using the areas may be expected. The short runway means that only short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft such as the BAe 146 can use the airport.AIP Vágar - Faroe IslandsAirlines and destinationsAir Iceland (Reykjavík)Atlantic Airways (Aalborg, Aberdeen, Billund, Copenhagen, London-Stansted, Narsarsuaq, Oslo, Reykjavík, Shetland Islands, Stavanger, Stockholm-Arlanda)Atlantic Airways, helicopter service (Dímun, Froðba, Hattarvík, Kirkja, Klaksvík, Koltur, Mykines, Skúvoy, Svínoy, Tórshavn)The helicopter services go to islands off the main islands and also make landings in the biggest towns. Some of these islands have less than 10 inhabitants.Ground transportThere are bus services about 10 times each direction per day between the airport and Tórshavn. They take one hour. The tunnel "Vágatunnilin" (4,9 km) connects the airport and the Vágar island to the main cities and villages in the Faroe islands.Accidents and incidentsOn 3 August 1996, a Gulfstream III (picture) of the Danish Air Force crashed during final approach to Vágar Airport in bad weather and poor visibility. Nine people, including the Chief of Defence and his wife, perished as the aircraft collided with high terrain surrounding the airport.ReferencesExternal linksVágar Airport, official siteWebcamCategory:Airports in the Faroe Islandsca:Aeroport de Vágar cs:Letiště Vágar da:Vágar Lufthavn de:Flughafen Vágar es:Aeropuerto de Vágar fo:Vága Floghavn fr:Aéroport de Vágar he:נמל התעופה ואוגר hu:Vágari repülőtér ja:ヴァガール空港 nl:Luchthaven Vágar no:Vágar lufthavn pl:Port lotniczy Vágar sr:Аеродром Вагар sv:Vágarflygplatsen vi:Sân bay Vágar
