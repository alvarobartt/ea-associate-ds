It is one of the more well-known gibbons and is often seen in zoos.RangeThe range of the Lar Gibbon historically extended from southwest China and eastern Myanmar to Thailand and Burma down the whole Malay Peninsula. It is also present in the northwest portion of the island of Sumatra. In recent decades, especially the continental range has been reduced and fragmented, and the animals are extinct in China.AppearanceThe fur coloring of the Lar Gibbon varies from black and dark-brown to light brown sandy colors. The hands and feet are white colored, likewise a ring of white hair surrounds the black face. Both males and females can have all color variants, and the sexes also hardly differ in size. As is the case for all gibbons, they have long hands and no tail.DietThe diet of the Lar Gibbon is mainly fruits and leaves, but it will also eat buds, flowers, birds and insectsBehaviorLar Gibbons are diurnal and arboreal, inhabiting rain forests. They rarely come on ground, but they use their long arms to brachiate through the trees. With their hooked hands they can move swiftly with great momentum, swinging from the branches. Traditionally thought to form lifelong monogamous pairings, long-term studies conducted in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand suggest that their mating system is somewhat flexible, incorporating extra-pair copulations, partner changes and polyandrous groupings. The family groups inhabit a firm territory, which they protect by warding off other gibbons with their calls.ReproductionSexually they are similar to other gibbons. Gestation is seven months long and pregnancies are usually of a single young. Young are nursed for approximately two years, and full maturity comes at about 8 years. The life expectancy of the Lar Gibbons in the wild is about 25 years.StatusLar Gibbons are threatened in various ways: they are sometimes hunted for their meat, sometimes a parent is killed in order to capture young animals for pets. The largest danger, however, is the loss of habitat. With breathtaking speed the forests of Southeast Asia are cut down in order to establish plantations, fields and settlements. National parks and protected areas exist, but are often poorly supervised.SubspeciesThere are five subspecies of Lar Gibbon:Malaysian Lar Gibbon, Hylobates lar larCarpenter's Lar Gibbon, Hylobates lar carpenteriCentral Lar Gibbon, Hylobates lar entelloidesSumatran Lar Gibbon, Hylobates lar vestitusYunnan Lar Gibbon, Hylobates lar yunnanensis (possibly extinct) Image:White-handed Gibbon Hylobates lar Black 1800px.jpg|A black colored Lar Gibbon Image:White-handed Gibbon Hylobates lar Orange 1900px.jpg|Light brown-orange Lar Gibbon Image:Henry Vilas Zoo IMG 2393.jpg|Lar Gibbons at Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisconsin Image:White-handed Gibbon.jpg ReferencesExternal links ARKive - [http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Hylobates_lar/ images and movies of the white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar)]Lar Gibbon photosLar Gibbon songsGibbon Conservation CenterLar Gibbon at Animal Diversity Web Category:Apes Gibbon, Lar Gibbon, Lar Gibbon, Lar Gibbon, Lar Gibbon, Lar Gibbon, Larcs:Gibon lar da:Hvidhåndet gibbon de:Weißhandgibbon es:Hylobates lar eo:Blankmana gibono fr:Gibbon à mains blanches it:Hylobates lar he:גיבון לבן יד ka:თეთრხელა გიბონი lt:Baltarankis gibonas hu:Fehérkezű gibbon nl:Withandgibbon ja:シロテテナガザル pl:Gibon białoręki ru:Белорукий гиббон zh:白掌長臂猿
