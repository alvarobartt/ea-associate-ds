In the latter capacity, he orchestrated the Conservatives' unexpected fourth consecutive electoral victory in 1992, but lost his own seat in the House of Commons.He then accepted the post of last Commander in Chief and British Governor of Hong Kong. After Hong Kong's handover to the People's Republic of China, Patten became the European Commissioner for foreign relations. After leaving that post, he returned to the UK and was raised to the Peerage. He is the Chancellor of Newcastle University and the University of Oxford.Early lifeChris Patten was educated at St Benedict's School at Ealing Abbey, and at Balliol College, Oxford. He worked in the Conservative Party from 1966, first as desk officer and then director (from 1974 to 1979) of the Conservative Research Department.Member of ParliamentIn governmentPatten was a Member of Parliament from 1979 to 1992, serving as Minister for Overseas Development at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1986 to 1989.In 1989 he was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for the Environment and became responsible for the unpopular Poll Tax. Though he robustly defended the policy at the time, in his 2006 book Not Quite the Diplomat (published in the United States as Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain and Europe in the New Century) he claims to have thought it was a mistake on Margaret Thatcher's part. He also introduced, and steered through Parliament, the major legislation that became the Environmental Protection Act 1990.In 1990, John Major made Patten Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Chairman of the Conservative Party, with responsibility for organising the coming general election campaign. As party chairman, he was widely considered to be the main architect of the somewhat unexpected Conservative victory in the 1992 election. However, he lost his seat for Bath to the Liberal Democrat candidate, Don Foster, in 1992. Patten's defeat was attributed to several factors; the Poll Tax that he implemented which was especially unpopular in his constituency, and his duties as party chairman that prevented him from much local campaigning.Governor of Hong KongHad Patten been re-elected in 1992, he might have been rewarded by appointment as Foreign Secretary, although in his autobiography John Major said that he would have made Patten Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, in the three weeks leading up to the election, many party insiders sensed that Patten would not have been able to retain his seat, and Major was considering a patronage appointment.In any event, in July 1992, he became the 28th and last Governor of Hong Kong until its handover to the People's Republic of China on 30 June 1997. He was given an official Chinese name, Pang Ting Hong/Peng Dingkang (), for his governorship, before which he was known in Hong Kong as "Pak Tang" (). Unlike most previous Hong Kong Governors, he was not a career bureaucrat from the UK Foreign Office but a politician. However, he was not the first politician to become a Governor of Hong Kong - that was John Bowring (Governor of Hong Kong 1854–1859) and John Pope Hennessy (Governor of Hong Kong 1877-1882), who was a Conservative MP before he entered Colonial Service.Patten's tenure faced several different challenges, as many in Hong Kong were still reeling from the Tiananmen Square Massacre a few years earlier, while some were suspicious that the British would sell them out. He took steps to get in touch with the people of the colony, often taking public strolls. People in Hong Kong affectionately nicknamed him Fat Pang or Fei Peng (), making him the first and only governor to have a Chinese nickname.Patten's most controversial actions related to the election of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Legco members returned in 1995 were originally to serve beyond the handover, thereby providing institutional continuity across the reversion of Hong Kong to the PRC. Beijing had expected that the use of functional constituencies with limited electorates would be used to elect this council, however Patten extended the definition of functional constituencies and thus virtually every Hong Kong subject was able to vote for the so-called indirectly elected members (see Politics of Hong Kong) of the Legislative Council.Not surprisingly, his measure was strongly criticised by the pro-Beijing political parties of Hong Kong, who would suffer from the electoral changes. Patten was also denounced by the PRC government as the 'whore of the East,' a 'serpent' and a 'criminal who would be condemned for a thousand generations' (千古罪人). The legislative council which was elected under Patten's governorship was dissolved upon the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC and replaced by a Provisional Legislative Council which functioned until elections were held under the previous rules in 1998.However, Patten's institutional reform gained unprecedented support in Hong Kong and the criticism from the PRC government raised his popularity to a level he never enjoyed in the UK; he was widely seen as standing up for the colony's rights. Not withstanding the electoral controversy, even some of his critics admired his eloquency and praised his efforts to raise the level of debate in the colony. Ending up, the PRC did bow to pressure and after the handover, an increasing portion of seats in the Legco would be directly elected.At 00:00 HKT/16:00 GMT, 1 July 1997, he sent the following telegram:I HAVE RELINQUISHED THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS GOVERNMENT. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. This marked the end of British rule in Hong Kong and after the handover ceremony and he left the city, together with Prince Charles, on board [[HMY Britannia|HM Yacht Britannia]].Post GovernorshipIn 1998, Queen Elizabeth II appointed him a Companion of Honour. From 1998 to 1999, he chaired the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, better known as the Patten Commission, which had been established in 1998 as part of the Belfast Agreement. On 9 September 1999, the Commission produced its report, entitled A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland but popularly known as the Patten Report, which contained 175 symbolic and practical recommendations. This report led to the re-naming of the Royal Ulster Constabulary as the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He is also the co-chair of International Crisis Group, overseeing many international operations.European CommissionerIn 1999, he was appointed as one of the United Kingdom's two members to the European Commission as Commissioner for External Relations where he was responsible for the Union's development and cooperation programmes, as well as liaison with Javier Solana, the High Representative of the CFSP. He held this position within the Prodi Commission from 23 January 2000 until 22 November 2004. Patten oversaw many crises in the area of European foreign policy, most notably the failure of the European Union to come up with a common unified policy before the Iraq war in 2003. Although nominated for the post of President in the next Commission in 2004, he was unable to gain support from France and Germany.University roles and elevation to the PeeragePatten was appointed Chancellor of Newcastle University in 1999, and elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 2003. In 2005 he was raised to the Peerage as Baron Patten of Barnes, of Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond. In September 2005 he was elected a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of Massey College in the University of Toronto (the only person so elected except for the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh, the Duke of Edinburgh) as well as receiving an honorary Doctorate of Sacred Letters from the University of Trinity College, Toronto and an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Ulster.http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2005/1549.html. In October 2008, it was announced that Lord Patten will step down as Chancellor of Newcastle University in July 2009 after a decade in the rolehttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7661948.stm.Future in the Conservative PartyPatten's pro-European outlook is in stark contrast with that of the modern Conservative Party. Following Gordon Brown's ascension to the Labour leadership and Prime Ministership in June 2007 - and the defection of moderate Conservative MP Quentin Davies to the Labour Party - there was media speculation that Patten was likewise considering defecting to Labour.
