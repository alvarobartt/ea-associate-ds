She was used as a standard of reference for "good taste", such as during the "Cool Wall" segment of the programme, presenter Jeremy Clarkson would rate a car's coolness based mostly on what he thinks Scott Thomas's level of distaste for it would be. She made her long-awaited appearance as the "Star In A Reasonably Priced Car" on the episode broadcast on February 25, 2007. On this episode, amid excessive kowtowing from Clarkson and joking from Richard Hammond and James May because Clarkson has shown much affection for her in the past, she proceeded to rubbish most of the decisions Clarkson had made over the past years of the Cool Wall. She also ridiculed the car that he had just ordered, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.
