   is a Japanese company founded in 1961, manufacturing cameras, lenses, flashes and other photographic accessories. All Sigma products are produced in the company's own Aizu factory in Bandai, Fukushima, Japan. Although Sigma produces several camera models, the company is best known for producing lenses and other accessories that are compatible with the cameras produced by other companies.Sigma produces products to work with cameras from Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Konica Minolta, Sony, Olympus and Panasonic, as well as for their own cameras.Sigma lenses are usually less expensive than the equivalent offering from the manufacturer of the camera body in question, so are therefore often sold bundled with a camera body as a less expensive alternative to the manufacturer's body and lens kit.Sigma's digital SLRs, the SD9, SD10 and SD14, are unusual in their use of the Foveon X3 image sensor. All use the SA lens mount. The DP-1, a high-end P&amp;S camera, is also using the Foveon X3 image sensor, which gives it a much larger sensor than most other cameras of this type.CamerasSigma has made a number of film SLR cameras, including the SA-300, SA-7, and SA-9. They presently are making a DSLR, the Sigma SD14, the successor to the Sigma SD9 and Sigma SD10, all of which use the Foveon X3 sensor.All Sigma SLR and DSLR cameras use the Sigma SA mount, which is mechanically similar to the Pentax K mount and electrically an adaptation of the Canon EF lens mount lens control system.Sigma also produces a high-end compact digital camera, the Sigma DP1, using a similar 14 MP Foveon X3 image sensor to the Sigma SD14 DSLR.LensesSigma makes autofocus lenses for the Sigma AF, Canon EF, Nikon F, Minolta/Sony α, and Pentax K lens mounts. Each lens may not be available in all mounts, and may lack certain features (such as HSM) on certain mounts.DesignationsAsphericalAPO - Apochromatic lens element(s)OS - In lens "Optical Stabilization", analogous to Nikon VR or Canon ISHSM - "HyperSonic Motor", in-lens ultrasonic motor, analogous to Nikon SWM or Canon USM, etcEX - "Excellence", professional series.DG - Coatings optimized for Digital SLRs, still usable on 35mm or full frameDC - Lenses for DSLRs featuring APS-C size sensors onlyDF - "Dual Focus", lens features clutch to disengage focus ring when in AF modeHF - "Helical Focusing", front element of lens does not rotate (for when using circular polarizing filters)RF - "Retro-focus", this lens employs a retro-focus design to allow for unique focal length and aperture combinations.Zoom lensesWide-angle zooms12-24mm 4.5-5.6 EX DG Aspherical HSM15-30mm 3.5-4.5 EX DG Aspherical17-35mm 2.8-4 EX DG Aspherical HSM20-40mm 2.8 EX DG AsphericalStandard zooms24-60mm 2.8 EX DG24-70mm 2.8 EX DG24-70mm 3.5-5.6 Aspherical HF24-135mm 2.8-4.5 Aspherical IF28-70mm 2.8 EX DG28-70mm 2.8-4 DG28-105mm 2.8-4 DG28-105mm 3.8-5.6 Aspherical IF28-135mm 3.8-5.628-200mm 3.5-5.6 DG Macro28-300mm 3.5-6.3 DG MacroTelephoto zooms50-500mm 4-6.3 EX DG HSM70-200mm 2.8 EX DG MACRO HSM70-200mm 2.8 EX DG HSM70-300mm 4-5.6 DG MACRO70-300mm 4-5.6 APO DG MACRO80-400mm 4.5-5.6 EX OS100-300mm 4 EX DG HSM120-300mm 2.8 EX DG HSM120-400mm 4.5-5.6 APO DG OS HSM135-400mm 4.5-5.6 DG150-500mm 5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM170-500mm 5-6.3 DG200-500mm 2.8 EX DG (2x teleconverter included, allowing 400-1000mm 5.6)300-800mm 5.6 EX DG HSMPrime lensesWide-angle primes8mm 3.5 EX DG Circular Fisheye8mm 4 EX DG Circular Fisheye14mm 2.8 EX Aspherical HSM15mm 2.8 EX DG Diagonal Fisheye20mm 1.8 EX DG Aspherical RF24mm 1.8 EX DG Aspherical Macro28mm 1.8 EX DG Aspherical MacroMacro primesMacro 50mm 2.8 EX DGMacro 70mm 2.8 EX DGMacro 105mm 2.8 EX DGAPO Macro 150mm 2.8 EX DG HSMAPO Macro 180mm 3.5 EX DG IF HSMTelephoto primesAPO 300mm 2.8 EX DG HSMAPO 500mm 4.5 EX DG HSMAPO 800mm 5.6 EX DG HSMDC lenses for [[APS-C]]4.5mm 2.8 EX DC Circular Fisheye HSM10mm 2.8 EX DC Fisheye HSM10-20mm 4-5.6 EX DC HSM17-70mm 2.8-4.5 DC MACRO18-50mm 2.8 EX DC18-50mm 2.8 EX DC MACRO18-50mm 3.5-5.6 DC18-125mm 3.5-5.6 DC18-125mm 3.8-5.6 DC OS HSM18-200mm 3.5-6.3 DC18-200mm 3.5-6.3 DC OS (HSM Version for Nikon only)30mm 1.4 EX DC HSM50-150mm 2.8 EX DC HSM55-200mm 4-5.6 DCSee alsoList of digital camera brandsHyper Sonic Motor (HSM)ReferencesExternal links Sigma Corporation Sigma Corporation of America Sigma France List of Sigma lenses + informations Review of the Sigma 120-300mm f/2.8 EX DG HSM and 300-800mm f/5.6 EX DG HSM from the Royal Photographic Society JournalCategory:Manufacturing companies of Japan Category:Photography companies Category:Lens manufacturers Category:Companies headquartered in Kanagawa Category:photographic lensescs:Sigma Corporation de:Sigma (Unternehmen) es:Sigma Corporation fr:Sigma Corporation ko:시그마 (기업) it:Sigma (azienda giapponese) lb:Sigma Corporation nl:Sigma (bedrijf) ja:シグマ (カメラ) no:Sigma Corporation pl:Sigma Corporation ru:Sigma Corporation fi:Sigma Corporation sv:Sigma Corporation zh:適馬
