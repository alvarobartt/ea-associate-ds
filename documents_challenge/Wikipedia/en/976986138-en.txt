The Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is the most widespread species of the flamingo family. It is found in parts of Africa, southwest Asia (including Turkey), southern Asia (coastal regions of India) and southern Europe (including Spain, Sardinia, Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, and the Camargue region of France). Some populations are short distance migrants, and records north of the breeding range are relatively frequent; however, given the species' popularity in captivity whether these are truly wild individuals is a matter of some debate. A single bird was seen on North Keeling Island (Cocos (Keeling) Islands) in 1988. Greater flamingo is the state bird of Gujarat, India.This is the largest species of flamingo, averaging 110-150 cm (43-60 in) tall and weighing 2-4 kg (4.4-8.8 lbs). The largest male flamingoes have been recorded at up to 187 cm (74 in) tall and 4.5 kg (10 lbs).en.tourduvalat.org/content/download/7378/73859/version/2/file/All+About+Greater+Flamingo.pdf. It is closely related to the American Flamingo and Chilean Flamingo, with which it is has sometimes been considered conspecific, but that treatment is now widely (e.g. by the American and British Ornithologists' Union) as incorrect and based on a lack of evidence.Like all flamingos, this species lays a single chalky-white egg on a mud mound.Most of the plumage is pinkish-white, but the wing coverts are red and the primary and secondary flight feathers are black.The bill is pink with a restricted black tip, and the legs are entirely pink. The call is a goose-like honking.References Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concern.External linksGreater Flamingo videos on the Internet Bird CollectionGallery Image:Bristol.zoo.greater.flamingo.arp.jpg|Bristol Zoo Image:Flamingo.greater.flaps.750pix.jpg|Bristol Zoo Image:Greater_Flamingo_31-01-2006_15-14-04.JPG|Ras al Khor Bird Sanctuary, Dubai Image:Flamingoinflight.jpg|Arles, France  Category:Phoenicopteridae Flamingo, Greater Category:Birds of Europe Category:Fauna of East Africa Category:Fauna of West Africa Category:Birds of Kazakhstan Category:Birds of Botswana Category:Birds of Egypt Category:Birds of Ethiopia Category:Birds of India Category:Birds of Kenya Category:Birds of Namibia Category:Birds of Pakistan Category:Birds of Turkey Category:Birds of Gibraltaraf:Grootflamink ar:بشروش ca:Phoenicopterus roseus cs:Plameňák růžový de:Rosaflamingo es:Phoenicopterus roseus eo:Roza flamengo fr:Flamant rose gl:Flamingo rosa it:Phoenicopterus roseus lt:Didysis flamingas hu:Rózsás flamingó nl:(Gewone) flamingo ja:オオフラミンゴ no:Flamingo (art) oc:Phoenicopterus ruber pl:Flaming różowy pt:Flamingo-comum ru:Обыкновенный фламинго fi:Flamingo sv:Större flamingo tr:Büyük flamingo zh-yue:大紅鸛
