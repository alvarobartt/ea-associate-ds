The other two peaks are the Eiger (3,970 m) with its famous north face, and the Mönch (4,099 m).The summit of the mountain was first reached in 1811 by the Meyer brothers of Aarau. Once difficult to access, the Jungfraubahn cog railway now runs inside the mountain, up to the Jungfraujoch railway station at , the highest in Europe.The train into the mountain leaves from Kleine Scheidegg, which can be reached by trains from Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen. The train enters the tunnel running eastward through the Eiger shortly after leaving Kleine Scheidegg.It runs close behind the Eiger's north face, stopping at Eigerwand, where there is a window about 8 m long and a metre high, halfway up the face. The windows have been placed in holes used to remove excavated rock from the tunnel during construction, and are also occasionally used as access points to rescue climbers. This window was used for one of the final scenes of a Clint Eastwood spy movie the The Eiger Sanction. There one can get off the train to admire the view before the train continues five minutes later. The tunnel then turns west, heading towards the Jungfrau. There is a second stop at a window looking out on the Eismeer ("Sea of Ice") before the train continues to the Jungfraujoch. The tunnel was constructed between 1898 and 1912; it is about 7 km (4 mi) long, with gradients of up to 25%. The journey from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungfraujoch takes approximately 50 minutes including the stops at Eigerwand and Eismeer; the downhill return journey taking only 35 minutes.]] A large complex of tunnels and buildings has been constructed at the Jungfraujoch, mostly into the south side of the Mönch. There is a hotel, two restaurants, an observatory, a research station, a small cinema, a ski school, and the "Ice Palace", a collection of elaborate ice sculptures. Another tunnel leads outside to a flat, snow-covered area, where one can walk around and look down to the Konkordiaplatz and the Aletsch Glacier, as well as the surrounding mountains.External linksJungfraujoch Top of EuropeLive Webcam at Jungfraujoch Top of EuropePhoto Eiger Mönch and JungfrauPhoto Jungfrau from Kleine ScheideggPhotosynth from Harder Kulm Free Photosynth addon needed.Category:Alpine Four-thousanders Category:Bernese Alps Category:Mountains of the Alps Category:Mountains of Switzerland Category:World Heritage Sites in Switzerlandbg:Юнгфрау cs:Jungfrau cy:Jungfrau de:Jungfrau (Berg) es:Jungfrau eo:Jungfraŭ eu:Jungfrau fr:Jungfrau it:Jungfrau he:יונגפראו lb:Jungfrau lt:Jungfrau hu:Jungfrau nl:Jungfrau ja:ユングフラウ no:Jungfrau pl:Jungfrau ro:Jungfrau rm:Jungfrau sv:Jungfrau th:ยอดเขายุงเฟรา tr:Jungfrau Dağı zh:少女峰
