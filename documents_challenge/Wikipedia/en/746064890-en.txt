  Robert Michels (9 January 1876, Cologne, Germany — 3 May 1936, Rome, Italy) was a German sociologist who wrote on the political behavior of intellectual elites and contributed to elite theory. He is best known for his book Political Parties, which contains a description of the "iron law of oligarchy." He was a student of Max Weber, friend and discipulus of Sombart and Loria. Politically, he moved from the Social Democrats, to Italian socialist party , Psi,adhering to the Italian revolutionary syndicalism wing and later to Italian Fascism, which he saw as a more democratic form of socialism.BiographyMichels , from a wealthy German family, studied in England, in Paris (at the Sorbonne), and at universities in Munich, Leipzig (1897), Halle (1898), and Turin. He became a Socialist while teaching at the University of Marburg, and became active with the radical wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany; he left the party in 1907. Brilliant pupil of Max Weber, in that epoque he achieved high fame for a writing , historical and sociological well based, Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie. Untersuchungen über die oligarchischen Tendenzen des Gruppenlebens (1911),( Sociology of political parties in modern democracy :a study on oligarchic tendencies in political aggregations) , in which he demonstrated that political parties can't be democratic, even the socialist ones, because they quickly transform themselves in bureaucratic oligarchies. In Italy he adhered to the Italian | sindacalismo rivoluzionario( not related to the revolutionary syndicalism, being the Italian movement still socialist ), a left branch of Psi. Michels was really critic on Marx's materialistic determinism;he based his socialism in a more empirical way, stated on Sombart's historical methods. He was really attracted by Italian culture, and the mix between this fact and his universal high reputation in social sciences gave him , thanks to Luigi Einaudi and especially to Achille Loria, the professorship at the University of Turin, where he taught economics, political science and socioeconomics, in despite of the lack of economical studies. In 1914, he became the professor of economics at the University of Basel; where he taught until 1926. After WWI he adhered to Fascism, party leaded by the ex national leader in chief of Psi , Mussolini , being convinced Michels that the direct link between Mussolini's charisma and the proletariat was in some way the unique mode to realize a real proletarian government, without political bureaucratic intermediation. His last years were spent in Italy teaching economics and the history of doctrines at the University of Perugia.Writings of MichelsSyndicalisme & socialisme ...
