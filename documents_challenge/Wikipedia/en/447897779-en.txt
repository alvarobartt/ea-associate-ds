It is the smallest of the six counties that form Northern Ireland in area and second smallest in Ulster.

The County also boasts a broad range of historical sites and remains and was served as the power centre of a number of important leaders down the through the ages.County Armagh borders Lough Neagh to the north, County Down and Carlingford Lough to the east, County Tyrone to the north-west, and counties Louth and Monaghan, both in the Republic of Ireland, to the south and south-west respectively.Geography &amp; featuresFrom its highest point at Slieve Gullion, in the south of the County, Armagh's land falls away from its rugged south with Carrigatuke, Lislea and Camlough mountains, to rolling drumlin country in the middle and west of the county and finally flatlands in the North where rolling flats and small hills reach sea level at lough Neagh.County Armagh's boundary with Louth is marked by the rugged Ring of Gullion rising in the south of the county whilst much of its boundary with Monaghan and Down goes unoticed with seemless continuance of drumlins and small lakes.

It was ruled by the Red Branch, whose capital was Emain Macha (or Navan Fort) near Armagh. The site, and subsequently the city, were named after the goddess Macha. The Red Branch play an important role in the Ulster Cycle, as well as the Cattle Raid of Cooley. However, they were eventually driven out of the area by the Three Collas, who invaded in the 4th century and held power until the 12th. The Clan Colla ruled the area known as Airghialla or Oriel for these 800 years.The chief Irish septs of the county were descendants of the Collas, the O'Hanlons and MacCanns, and the Ui Neill, the O'Neills of Fews. Armagh was divided into several baronies: Armagh was held by the O'Rogans, Lower Fews was held by O'Neill of the Fews, and Upper Fews were under governance of the O'Larkins, who were later displaced by the MacCanns. Oneilland East was the territory of the O'Garveys, who were also displaced by the MacCanns. Oneilland West, like Oneilland East, was once O'Neill territory, until it was then held by the MacCanns, who were Lords of Clanbrassil. Upper and Lower Orior were O'Hanlon territory. Tiranny was ruled by Ronaghan. Miscellaneous tracts of land were ruled by O'Kelaghan.Armagh was the seat of St. Patrick, and in Roman Catholic tradition, continues to be his see. County Armagh is one of four historic counties of Northern Ireland to presently have a majority of the population from a Catholic community background, according to the 2001 census.The TroublesThe South of Armagh was the most militarised region in Western Europe due to the history of the Troubles. The region has been a stronghold of support for the IRA, earning it the nickname "Bandit Country". South Armagh is predominantly nationalist, with most of the population being opposed to any form of British presence, especially that of a military nature. See Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade for further informationAdministrationThe primary remaining official use of County Armagh is as a Lieutenancy area and the county retains a lord lieutenant who acts as representative of the British Monarch in the County.County Armagh ceased to serve as a local government unit in 1973 and currently the county is divided into three district councils for local government purposes, namely Armagh City and District Council, most of Craigavon Borough Council, and approximately the western third of Newry and Mourne District Council. With the proposed reform of Local government in Northern Ireland in 2011, County Armagh is proposed to be form part of two new council areas, Armagh City and Bann District, and Newry City and Down.Armagh has ceased to serve as an electoral constituency in 1983 but remains the core of the Newry and Armagh Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency) and Newry &amp; Armagh Northern Ireland Assembly electoral constituencies.

There are two cathedrals in the city, both dedicated to St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. One is the Church of Ireland Cathedral, the seat of the Anglican archbishop, the primate of the Church of Ireland.
