He reported it and Oberon the same year.Herschel, "An Account of the Discovery of Two Satellites Revolving Round the Georgian Planet", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 77, pp. 125-129, 1787; and "On George's Planet and its satellites", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 78, pp. 364-378, 1788. He later reported four more satellites, which turned out to be spurious."On the Discovery of Four Additional Satellites of the Georgium Sidus; The Retrograde Motion of Its Old Satellites Announced; And the Cause of Their Disappearance at Certain Distances from the Planet Explained", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 88, pp. 47-79, 1798.Name and pronunciation[[Image:PIA00039 Titania.jpg|thumb|left|This Voyager 2 image of Titania shows enormous rifts.]] The names of Titania and the other four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by Herschel's son John Herschel in 1852 at the request of William Lassell, who had discovered Ariel and Umbriel the year before.http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/AN.../0034//0000169.000.html Adsabs.harvard.edu Retrieved on 05-19-07  Lassell had earlier endorsed Herschel's 1847 naming scheme for the seven then-known satellites of Saturn and had named his newly-discovered eighth satellite Hyperion in accordance with Herschel's naming scheme in 1848.All of the moons of Uranus are named for characters from Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. Titania was named after Titania, the Queen of the Faeries in A Midsummer Night's Dream.Shakespeare's character's name is pronounced , but the moon is often , by analogy with the familiar chemical element titanium. The adjectival form, Titanian, is homonymous with that of Saturn's moon Titan.It is also called Uranus&nbsp;III.Physical characteristicsSo far the only close-up images of Titania are from the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its Uranus flyby in January, 1986. At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the Sun; the northern hemisphere was unobservable.Although its interior composition is uncertain, one model suggests that Titania is composed of roughly 50% water ice, 30% silicate rock, and 20% methane-related organic compounds. A major surface feature is a huge canyon that dwarfs the scale of the Grand Canyon on Earth and is in the same class as the Valles Marineris on Mars or Ithaca Chasma on Saturn's moon Tethys.Scientists recognise the following geological features on Titania:Chasmata (chasms)CratersRupes (scarps)OccultationOn September 8, 2001, Titania occulted a faint star; this was an opportunity to both refine its diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 0.03 microbars; if it exists, it would have to be far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto.http://www.obspm.fr/actual/nouvelle/mar02/titania.en.shtml Obspm.fr Retrieved on 05-19-07 http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/~titania/results.html Lesia.obspm.fr Retrieved on 05-19-07 See alsoList of geological features on TitaniaTitania in fictionNotesExternal linksTitania Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration  Category:Uranus' moonsbg:Титания (спътник) ca:Titània (satèl·lit) cs:Titania (měsíc) co:Titania cy:Titania (lloeren) da:Titania (måne) de:Titania (Mond) es:Titania (luna) eo:Titanjo fr:Titania (lune) ko:티타니아 (위성) hr:Titanija (mjesec) it:Titania (astronomia) he:טיטניה ht:Titanya la:Titania (satelles) lt:Titanija (palydovas) mr:टायटेनिया nl:Titania (maan) ja:チタニア no:Titania nn:Uranusmånen Titania nds:Titania (Maand) pl:Tytania (księżyc) pt:Titânia (satélite) ro:Titania (satelit) ru:Титания (спутник) simple:Titania (moon) sk:Titania (mesiac) sl:Titanija (luna) fi:Titania sv:Titania tr:Titania (uydu) ur:ٹیٹانیہ zh:天卫三
