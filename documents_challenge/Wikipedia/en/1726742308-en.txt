It is maintained as a garden island and a model of excellent environmental practices.The island belongs to the Lennart Bernadotte-Stiftung (English: the Lennart Bernadotte Foundation)http://www.mainau.de/htdocs/en/0105.htm, an entity created by the late Lennart, Count Bernadotte af Wisborg, formerly a Prince of Sweden and Duke of Smålandhttp://www.mainau.de/htdocs/en/0104_2.htm. It is one of the main tourist attractions of Lake Constance. Beside flowers there is a great park landscape with beautiful views on the lake. There is also a greenhouse with tropical climate and thousands of butterflies.Mainau Bay is the location of the university sailing club; their many small sailboats add to the summer scenery.Until the Napoleonic mediatisations and secularisations of small German fiefs this island belonged to the Order of Teutonic Knights. It was later sold into private ownership. In 1853 Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden purchased the island as his personal property and built a summer palace there. At the end of World War I Baden became a republic with the abdication of Grand Duke Frederick II, son of Frederick I. The former Grand Duke retained his private property including Mainau. When he died childless in 1928 the island passed to his sister Victoria of Baden, wife of King Gustaf V of Sweden. Upon her death two years later she bequeathed the island to her second son Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland and his descendants. In 1932 Prince Wilhem gave Mainau to his only child Count Lennart Bernadotte who owned it until 1974 when he transferred the island to a foundation. Count Bernadotte formed Enterprise Mainau GmbH in 1991 as a private enterprise to manage the island for the benefit of the Lennart Bernadotte-Stiftung. The Count remained active in managing Mainau until his death in 2004 but appointed his second wife Sonja co-manager in 2001. Today Lennart's widow Sonja Countess Bernadotte af Wisborg and his children run both the foundation and the management company.http://www.mainau.de/htdocs/en/0103.htmFurther readingMainau Island (official website)Mainau: A lot of picturesGallery Image:Mainau1.jpg Image:Mainau.jpg Image:Mainau3.jpg Image:Mainau5.jpg Image:Mainau6.jpg Image:Mainau4.jpg Image:Mainau7.jpg Image:Mainau8.jpg Image:Mainau9.jpg Image:Mainau10.jpg Image:Mainau11.jpg Image:Mainau12.jpg Image:Mainau13.jpg Image:Mainau14.jpg Image:Mainau15.jpg Image:Mainau16.jpg Image:Mainau_Palace_03.jpg | The Castle in spring 2008 Category:Islands of Germany Category:Islands in lakescs:Mainau cy:Ynys Mainau de:Mainau et:Mainau es:Mainau fr:Île de Mainau it:Isola di Mainau hu:Mainau mr:माइनाउ nl:Mainau no:Mainau nn:Mainau pl:Mainau pt:Ilha Mainau sv:Mainau vo:Maineän
