Keys' mother is of Irish and Italian descent, and her father is Jamaican. Keys describes herself as comfortable with her biracial heritage: "I grew up in New York and, thank God, I never had to go through that in regards to, 'You're not black enough, you're not white enough,' the whole kind of white/black-mixture thing. I never had to go through that. I went through prejudices and all, surely. But I never had to battle with those two parts of me."Keys avoids mixed race abuseKeys' parents separated during her early childhood, and she was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen, also in Manhattan. In 1985, Keys and a group of other girls played the parts of Rudy Huxtable's sleepover guests in an episode of The Cosby Show called "Slumber Party"."Slumber Party". The Cosby Show. March 28, 1985. No. 1, episode 22. She began playing the piano when she was seven, learning classical music by composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, and her favorite, Chopin. Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name at age sixteen until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. Keys felt that name represented her both as a performer and person.Keys graduated from the Professional Performing Arts School, a prestigious high school in Manhattan, as valedictorian at the age of sixteen in only three years. Although accepted to Columbia University, she decided to drop out and pursue her musical career. Keys signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and his So So Def label, then distributed by Columbia Records. She co-wrote and recorded a song entitled "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 blockbuster, Men in Black. The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never released as a single and her record contract with Columbia Records ended quickly. Keys later met Clive Davis, who signed her to Arista Records, which has since disbanded. Following Davis to his newly-formed J Records label, she recorded the songs "Rock wit U" and "Rear View Mirror", featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001) respectively. Keys then released her debut album, Songs in A Minor.Music career''Songs in A Minor'' (2001) Selling over 235,000 copies in its first week (more than 50,000 of those on its first day), Songs in A Minor, released on June 5, 2001, went on to sell over ten million units worldwide, and established Keys' popularity both outside and inside the U.S., where she became the best-selling new artist of 2001 (as well as the best-selling R&B artist). The album's first single, "Fallin'", gained radio airplay on many different radio formats and spent six weeks at number one on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Keys performed Donny Hathaway's 1973 song "Someday We'll All Be Free" at the America: A Tribute to Heroes televised benefit concert following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Another single from Songs in A Minor, "A Woman's Worth", made the top ten in the U.S. as well. The album led Keys to win five Grammy Awards in 2002: Song of the Year, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, and Best R&amp;B Song for "Fallin'", Best New Artist, and Best R&amp;B Album; "Fallin'" was also nominated for Record of the Year.

Keys stated, “All my life, I’ve written these words with no thought or intention of sharing them. Not even with my confidants.” This novel consists of her innermost thoughts about everything; life, observations, emotions, her past, modern society, etc. “Some of them are painful; some of them are just observations, some silly, some that have affected me so deeply and with such frustration that they only way to express the confusion was to write it down.” Tears for Water is filled with a wide variety of poems, with various categories and topics, for instance, there are poems on war, prostitution, strippers, landscapes in Spain, democracy and politics, and more. She says she calls this novel Tears for Water because, "…everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, or pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question." Keys has a common style of writing throughout all of poems which permits the reader to relate to her poems without struggle. All of her poetry lacks a form of alliteration and assonance, the effect created when words with the same initial letter, either constants or vowels, are used in close proximity. Also, she uses a free verse structure, the lack of a formal meter or rhyme pattern and instead relies upon natural rhythms of her everyday speech. In certain poems, a form of dissonance is used, the deliberate use of inharmonious syllables, words, or phrases in order to create a harsh-toned effect. Along with the poems in this novel, she includes the lyrics to her first albums Songs in A minor and The Diary of Alicia Keys, and a few excerpts explaining the meaning behind some of her poems and why they were written.Tours2001: American Tour2001/2002: European Tour2004: Asian/Australian Tour2004: Verizon Ladies First Tour (with Beyoncé and Missy Elliott)2004: European Tour2005: The Diary Tour (U.S.)2008: As I Am Tour (Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania.)AwardsNotesReferencesExternal linksOfficial website        Category:Alicia Keys Category:1981 births Category:American actor-singers Category:American composers Category:American contraltos Category:American female singers Category:American film actors Category:American music arrangers Category:American music video directors Category:American philanthropists Category:American pianists Category:American record producers Category:American rhythm and blues keyboardists Category:American rhythm and blues singer-songwriters Category:American soul keyboardists Category:American soul singers Category:American television actors Category:Americans of Irish descent Category:Americans of Italian descent Category:English-language singers Category:Grammy Award winners Category:J Records artists Category:Jamaican American musicians Category:Living people Category:Multiracial actors Category:Multiracial musicians Category:Neo soul singers Category:New York actors Category:New York City musicians Category:People from Manhattan Category:Rhythm and blues pianists bg:Алиша Кийс ca:Alicia Keys cs:Alicia Keys da:Alicia Keys de:Alicia Keys et:Alicia Keys es:Alicia Keys eu:Alicia Keys fa:آلیشا کیز fr:Alicia Keys gl:Alicia Keys hr:Alicia Keys id:Alicia Keys it:Alicia Keys he:אלישה קיז ka:ალიშია კისი lt:Alicia Keys ms:Alicia Keys nl:Alicia Keys ja:アリシア・キーズ no:Alicia Keys pl:Alicia Keys pt:Alicia Keys ro:Alicia Keys ru:Кис, Алишия sc:Alicia Keys simple:Alicia Keys sk:Alicia Keys sr:Ališa Kiz fi:Alicia Keys sv:Alicia Keys tl:Alicia Keys th:อลิเชีย คียส์ vi:Alicia Keys tr:Alicia Keys yo:Alicia Keys zh:艾麗西亞·基斯
