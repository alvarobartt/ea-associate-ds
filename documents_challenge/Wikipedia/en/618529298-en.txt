His character's romance with Patsy Pease's character, Kimberly Brady, made the duo into a soap supercouple and revived interest in Days among teenage viewers in the 1980s. Shaughnessy is also well known for his portrayal of Maxwell Sheffield opposite Fran Drescher on The Nanny from 1993 to 1999. He and Drescher resumed acting together on Drescher's latest sitcom, Living with Fran, wherein Shaughnessy appeared fairly frequently as her philandering but needy ex-husband, Ted.
