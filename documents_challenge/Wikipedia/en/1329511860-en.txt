In the 12th century, such a successful career from humble beginnings is a mark of outstanding abilities. His learning recommended him to Pope Paschal II (1099&ndash;1118), who called him to Rome. Elected Cardinal Priest of the Titulus S. Praxedis in 1099, Lamberto was one of the cardinals who accompanied Pope Gelasius II in exile in 1118&ndash;1119. As a tested opponent of the Emperor's right to select bishops in his territories &ndash; the Investiture Controversy &ndash; Lamberto was a natural choice for papal legate; he was sent in 1119 to deal with Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor (1105&ndash;25), and delegated with powers to come to an understanding concerning the right of investiture. The struggle came to a conclusion with the Concordat of Worms (1122), the "Pactum Calixtinum" that was almost as much a Pactum Lamberti was effected on September 23, 1123.During his pontificate the Premonstratensian Order, and also that of the Knights Templar, received papal sanction.ReferencesOriginal text taken from a paper copy of the 9th edition Encyclopædia Britannica; 1881[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07456a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia:] Honorius II        Category:Popes Category:Italian popes Category:Cardinal-bishops of Ostia Category:12th century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from the Province of Bologna Category:11th century births Category:1130 deathsaf:Pous Honorius II ca:Honori II cs:Honorius II. cy:Pab Honoriws II de:Honorius II.
