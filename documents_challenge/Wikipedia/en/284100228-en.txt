Ross Robinson is a music producer, who has worked with acts such as Machine Head, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Sepultura, Norma Jean and many others.Life and workRobinson began as a thrash guitarist of Detente and picked up his knowledge of producing from the studios where his band recorded demos. It wasn't long before Robinson was well-versed enough with the recording studio that he received his first production job for the 1991 Fear Factory album Concrete. Robinson would use the album as a showcase of sorts in helping him land producing slots with other notable acts, particularly up and coming acts like Korn.Robinson has been spoken of as "The Godfather of Nu Metal." Although he has denounced the Nu Metal movement for becoming complacent and the newer bands for not expanding on the style, which he helped create with Korn's first album, Korn (1994). Robinson has also been successful in the post-hardcore genre, producing At the Drive-In's final album, Relationship of Command in 2000, as well as Glassjaw's albums, Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence (2000) and Worship and Tribute (2002). Robinson has also worked with the likes of The Cure on their eponymous album (2004) and From First to Last on their album Heroine (2006).In 2003 he produced The Blood Brothers' ...Burn, Piano Island, Burn, which was a departure for both the band and Robinson. In contrast to The Blood Brothers' previously raw, often under- produced songs (which lasted as short a time as 90 seconds at times), ...Burn, Piano Island, Burn featured much longer and more complex compositions, while Robinson's decision to work with a previously little-known hardcore band with experimental leanings was at odds with his previous choices of more straight forward nu-metal acts. The resulting recording however still contains Robinson's trademark techniques of loud, dynamic recordings.Robinson was the owner of the IAM: Wolfpack label.In 2007 it was announced that Ross was starting a new label IAM: Wolfpack which was release the debut CD from Black Light Burns titled Cruel Melody.He is also a Co-Owner of Semi-Private NY Nightclub The Plumm, along with David Wells, Jesse Bradford, Noel Ashman, among others.It has been confirmed by Jonathan Davis of Korn that Robinson will produce Korn's upcoming 9th studio album, which is due for a summer 2009 release.He Co-Drummed on "Ratamahatta" with Sepultura.MusicianRecognize no Authority - Detente (1986) (guitar player)Albums producedConcrete - Fear Factory (1991)The Crimson Idol - W.A.S.P.
