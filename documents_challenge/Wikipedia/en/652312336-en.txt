He also gave the first full proof for the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.Frobenius was born in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin, and was educated at the University of Berlin. His thesis was on the solution of differential equations, under the direction of Weierstrass. After its completion in 1870, he taught in Berlin for a few years before receiving an appointment at the Polytechnicum in Zurich (now ETH Zurich). In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.Contributions to group theoryGroup theory was one of Frobenius' principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first notable contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today.More important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups. He also made fundamental contributions to the character theory of the symmetric groups.Contributions to number theoryFrobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q. Specifically, if K''/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime ''p which does not ramify in K'' and to each prime ideal ''P lying over p'' in ''K there is a unique element g'' of Gal(''K/Q) satisfying the condition g''(''x) = x''''p (mod P'') for all integers ''x of K''. Varying ''P over p'' changes ''g into a conjugate (and every conjugate of g'' occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of ''g in the Galois group is canonically associated to p''. This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of ''p and any element of the conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of p''. If we take for ''K the m''th cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo ''m (and thus is abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for p'' not dividing ''m the Frobenius class in the Galois group is p'' mod ''m. From this point of view, the distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions. The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.See alsoFrobenius algebraFrobenius conjectureFrobenius endomorphism (also known as Frobenius morphism)Frobenius methodFrobenius normFrobenius normal formFrobenius numberFrobenius polynomialFrobenius pseudoprimeFrobenius theorem (differential topology)Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)Frobenius-Schur indicatorCauchy-Frobenius lemmaPerron–Frobenius theoremExternal links Category:1849 births Category:1917 deaths Category:19th century mathematicians Category:20th century mathematicians Category:German mathematicians Category:Group theorists Category:Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Category:People from Berlin Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Category:ETH Zurich facultyde:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius es:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius fr:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius it:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius ht:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius la:Ferdinandus Georgius Frobenius nl:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius pl:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius ru:Фробениус, Фердинанд Георг sl:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius sv:Ferdinand Georg Frobenius zh:费迪南德·格奥尔格·弗罗贝尼乌斯
