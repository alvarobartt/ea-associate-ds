He was elected an unprecented six times as German Referee of the Year.2001 Bundesliga season finals incidentIn the last gameday of the 2000-1 Bundesliga season, Merk was assigned to referee the match between Hamburger SV and FC Bayern Munich. Bayern was leading Schalke by three points, however, Schalke had the better goal differential. In the 93rd minute, HSV were leading Bayern 1-0, and Schalke had just won 5-3 versus SpVgg Unterhaching.

Portugal's opponent was Greece, whose team's coach, Otto Rehagel, was a dentist customer of Merk.FIFA careerMerk was referee in the 1992 Olympics (2 call-ups), the UEFA Euro 2000 (3), the 2002 FIFA World Cup (2) and the UEFA Euro 2004 (3). In that tournament, he also whistled the final, becoming the first German referee since Rudi Glöckner of East Germany in 1970, to helm a World Cup or European Championship Finals. His assistants were Jan-Hendrik Salver and Christian Schräer. Merk also refereed the 1997 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, and the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final.In the 2006 World Cup, he whistled three matches with mediocre results. After the match Australia-Brazil, he was verbally blasted by Harry Kewell for allegedly lop-sided, pro-Brazil refereeing http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/australia/5094458.stm, and after Ghana's victory over the United States, US Coach Bruce Arena and several players heavily criticized Merk's controversial call where he awarded a vital penalty kick to Ghana.  The United States vs. Ghana game was the last game in the 2006 World Cup for Merk, as he was not chosen to referee any of the games in the knockout stages. Merk was highly critical of the whole FIFA refereeing process after that, stating in the German sports TV show das aktuelle Sportstudio, it "robbed me two weeks of my life" being forced to stay in the referee camp without a call-up, and adding a mere two was a bitterly meagre payoff regarding the fact he (among others) had to visit countless seminars and were sent on small junior tournaments all over the world to merely assist, comparing it to as if Ronaldinho would have to agree to sit on the bench for the Brazilian U 20 in order to qualify for the World Cup.Merk is also a long-time proponent of instant video replay ("Videobeweis") to judge critical scenes. On March 1, 2008, Werder Bremen striker Markus Rosenberg scored a goal from clear offside position; Merk initially gave the goal, but immediately after that realised it was illegal, but it was too late to retract his error. He called it "the most bitter moment of my career" and called for introduction of instant replay.Nach Patzer: Merk will den VideobeweisAccoladesFIFA Referee of the Year: 2004, 2005, 2007DFB German Referee of the Year: 1995, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006Bundesverdienstkreuz 2005, handed out by Kurt BeckCharityThe religious Merk is active helping slums in India, providing basic dental care on the poor since 1991. He helps the Indienhilfe Kaiserslautern, which erects schools, housings for the homeless, and basic medical care.Personal lifeA dentist by trade, Merk lives in Otterbach with his wife and son. He was a professional dentist until 2005, when he stopped practising because of his opposition to the so-called Praxisgebühr, a measure introduced by the German government taxing patients visiting doctors. Today, he leads motivational seminars. During his youth and teens, Merk suffered ridicule because of his high-pitched, squeaky voice. After undergoing extensive speech therapy, he now talks in a normal baritone. (Reference: his book BeWEGEnd).Merk is also one of the fittest referees in the game. He regularly laps his colleagues in the annual fitness tests, and in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of April 15, 2006 (p. 55), it is said that he has run a marathon in a time of 2:42. In comparison, the Olympic record is only about half an hour faster. He is also a dedicated triathlete. http://www.faz.net/s/Rub81395A1084CE4DE0A416D80576BEA59C/Doc~E333E855D2ED841B8BEB6C8775726AD1D~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.htmlAs a side note, "Merk" is the imperative form of the German verb "merken" (to notice, to remember).
