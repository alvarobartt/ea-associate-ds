Southampton is a major port and the closest city to the New Forest. It lies at the northern-most point of Southampton Water where it is joined by the River Test and River Itchen, with the River Hamble joining to the south of the urban area. The local authority is Southampton City Council, which is a unitary authority. The city is part of the ceremonial county of Hampshire. Significant employers in Southampton include the University of Southampton, the Ford Transit factory and one of the largest commercial ports in Europe. The city represents the core of the Greater Southampton region, with a population of 228,600.  The city's name is sometimes abbreviated in writing to "So'ton" or "Soton", and a resident of Southampton is called a Sotonian. Southampton is noted for being the home of the RMS Titanic,  the Spitfire  and more recently a number of the largest cruise ships in the world.  HistoryThis section is an overview. For fuller details seeArchaeological finds suggest there have been settlements at Southampton since the stone age.Southampton museum of Archeology. Gods House Tower, Southampton. The Romans established a settlement known as Clausentum, shortly after their invasion of Britain in AD 43. It was an important trading port, at the site of modern Bitterne Manor. The Romans abandoned this settlement circa 410The Anglo-Saxons formed a new, larger, settlement across the Itchen centred on what is now the St Mary's area of the city. The settlement was known as Hamwic, which evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton.. Archeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artifacts in Europe.Viking raids from 840 onwards contributed to the decline of Hamwic in the 9th century, and by the 10th century, a fortified settlement, which became Medieval Southampton had been established.Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, Southampton became the major port of transit between the then capital of England, Winchester, and Normandy. Southampton Castle was built in the 12th century and by the 13th century, Southampton had become a leading port, particularly involved in the trade of French Wine in exchange for English cloth and wool..Surviving remains of 12th Century merchants' houses such as King John's House and Canute's Palace are evidence of the wealth that existed in the town at this timeSouthampton.

After this attack, the city's walls - part of which dates from 1175 - were extensively added to and reinforced. A large part of the town's walls remain today.The city walls include God's House Tower, built in 1417, the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England.24 hour museum: God's House Tower Museum of Archaeology, Southampton Accessed 1 August 2007 Over the years it has been used as home to the city's gunner, the Town Gaol and even as storage for the Southampton Harbour Board. Today, it is open as the Museum of Archaeology. The walls were completed in the 15th century, but later development of several new fortifications along Southampton Water and the Solent by Henry VIII, meant that Southampton was no longer dependent upon its fortifications.Southampton.

Innovative buildings specifically for this purpose were built at West Quay, with baths that were filled and emptied by the flow of the tide.The town experienced major expansion during the Victorian era. The Southampton Docks company had been formed in 1835. In October 1838 the foundation stone of the docks was laid and the first dock opened in 1842. The structural and economic development of docks continued for the next few decades. The railway link to London was fully opened in May 1840. Southampton subsequently became known as The Gateway to the Empire.[[Image:Southampton-TitanicEngineersMemorial.jpg|thumb|right|The memorial to the engineers of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS Titanic]].]]The port was the point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard the Mayflower in 1620. In 1912 the [[RMS Titanic|RMS Titanic]] sailed from Southampton. Many of the crew on-board the vessel were Sotonians, with about a third of those who perished in the tragedy hailing from the city.  Southampton was subsequently the home port for the transatlantic passenger services operated by Cunard and their Blue Riband liner RMS Queen Mary and her sister ship RMS Queen Elizabeth. In 1938, Southampton docks also became home to the flying boats of Imperial Airways. Southampton Container Terminals first opened in 1968 and has continued to expand.Mk XIX]]The Supermarine Spitfire was designed and developed in Southampton, evolving from the Schneider trophy winning seaplanes of the 1920s and 1930s. Heavy bombing of the factory in September 1940 destroyed it and homes in the vicinity, killing civilians and workers. World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area. Prior to the Invasion of Europe, components for Mulberry Harbour were built here. After D-Day, Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied, making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944.Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-9-3852-95-0. pp 169.Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. There has been extensive redevelopment since World-War II.  Increasing traffic congestion in the 1920s led to partial demolition of medieval walls around the Bargate in 1932 and 1938. However a large portion of those walls remain standing today, leaving Southampton with one of the longest surviving remnants of medieveal walls in the country.A Royal Charter in 1952 upgraded University College at Highfield to the University of Southampton. Southampton acquired city status becoming the City of Southampton in 1964.Government]]Southampton used to be a County Borough within the county of Hampshire, which in the past was known as the County of Southampton  or Southamptonshire.  This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974. However, the city became independent administratively from that county as it was made into a unitary authority in a local government re-organisation on 1 April 1997 - a result of the 1992 Local Government Act. The district remains part of the Hampshire ceremonial county.Southampton City Council consists of 48&nbsp;councillors elected by thirds. After the 2007 local council elections on 3 May 2007 the Council was split with 18&nbsp;seats each to the Labour and the Conservative Party, each having gained two, and 12 to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives took control in May 2007, after a Liberal Democrat resigned from her group to become an independent and voted for the Conservative leader Alec Samuels. During the budget setting meeting on 20 February 2008, a no confidence motion was passed and Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition.In the local elections on 1 May 2008, the Conservatives took overall control of Southampton, winning 15 of the 17&nbsp;seats being contested. Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders lost their seats to young Conservative challengers.As of 2008 the composition of the council is as follows:PartyMembersConservative]]26Labour]]14Liberal Democrats8Total48There are three members of parliament for the city: Rt Hon John Denham (Labour) for Southampton Itchen, the constituency for the east of the city, Dr Alan Whitehead (Labour) for Southampton Test which covers the west of the city, and Sandra Gidley (Liberal Democrat) for Romsey, which includes a northern portion of the city. The Boundary Commission for England has created the new constituency of Romsey and Southampton North, by enlarging the current Romsey seat. The new boundaries encompass the unitary authority wards of Bassett and Swaythling. It will be in place in time for the 2009 or 2010 General Election.Southampton's police service is provided by Hampshire Constabulary, its fire service by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service and the ambulance service by the South Central Ambulance Service. Police stations within the city boundaries can be found in Portswood, Bitterne, and Shirley, as well as at the Civic Centre in the city centre. Fire stations are located in St Mary's, Sholing and Redbridge.Geography and climateThe geography of Southampton is very much influenced by the sea and rivers. The city sits at the northern tip of the Southampton Water, a deepwater estuary, which is a ria formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge.The Port of Southampton L. E. Tavener Economic Geography, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Oct., 1950), pp. 260–273 The Test - which has saltmarsh that make it ideal for Salmon fishing  - runs along the Western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two - east and west. The city centre is located on the peninsula between the two rivers.Much of the waterfront has been reclaimed over the years, mainly for use as the Western Docks.  Most of the land used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water,  to ensure that the port can continue to handle some of the largest ships in the world. The shape of the coastline gives rise to a natural phenomena in Southampton, known as the double tide.  This gives the port a much longer high tide period than other ports, making the movement of large ships easier.  The city lies in the Hampshire Basin, which sits atop chalk beds.The Port of Southampton L. E. Tavener Economic Geography, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Oct., 1950), pp. 260–273The River Test runs along the western border of the city, separating it from the New Forest. There are a number of bridges over the Test from Southampton, including the road and rail bridges at Redbrige in the south and the M27 motorway to the north. The River Itchen, Hampshire runs through the middle of the city and is bridged at in several places. The northernmost bridge, and the first to be built, is at Mansbridge, where the A27 road crosses the Itchen. The original bridge is closed to road traffic, but is still standing and open to pedestrians and cyclists. The river is bridged again at Swaythling, where Woodmill Bridge separates the tidal and non tidal sections of the river. Further south is Cobden Bridge which is notable as it was opened as a free bridge (it was originally named the Cobden Free Bridge), and was never a toll bridge. Downstream of the Cobden Bridge is the Northam Railway Bridge, then the Northam Road Bridge, which was the first major pre-stressed concrete bridge to be constructed in the United Kingdom.  The southernmost bridge on the Itchen is the Itchen Bridge, which is a toll bridge. |accessdate = 2007-08-03 DemographicsSouthampton has a range of cultures and ethnic groups, which make up the estimated 228,600&nbsp;people living within the city boundary. There is a large Polish population in the city, with estimates as high as 20,000, or 1 in every 10 of the total population. Southampton also has large Asian and Irish communities.

Southampton has always been connected with maritime matters, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a port for cruise ships, its heyday being the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage(DFT) Provisional Port Statistics 2007, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Part of the docks have been redeveloped, however, as the Ocean Village development, a local marina and entertainment complex. Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport.During the latter half of the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft and automobile manufacture, cables, electrical-engineering products, and petrochemicals. These now sit alongside the city's traditional industries of the docks, grain milling, and tobacco processing. Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust is one of the city's largest employers. It provides local hospital services to half a million people in the Southampton area and specialist regional services to more than three million people across the South of England.
