The AGV is an Alstom train intended as the successor to France’s TGV high-speed trains; the name stands for '' 'a'utomotrice à 'g'rande 'v'itesse'', or ‘high-speed self-propelled carriage’. Instead of having separate power cars at either end of the train, as current TGVs do, the AGV will have distributed traction with motors under the floors of the passenger carriages. This is the arrangement used on many regular-speed multiple-unit trains and also high-speed trains such as the Siemens Velaro and Japan's Shinkansen trains. The space saved through not having a power car will enable the AGV to provide more seats.Alstom offer the AGV in configurations from seven to fourteen carriages, with a total of 250-650 seats, depending on internal layout and number of carriages. The commercial service speed will be . The AGV weighs less than its rivals which reduces its power consumption, and it consumes 30% less energy than previous TGV designs.The prototype was unveiled on 5 February, 2008, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in attendance.NTVThe first customer for the AGV is Italian company Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori, Europe's first private open access high speed train operator. NTV has ordered 25 11-coach AGV trains in a contract announced on January 17 2008.TestingPégase, the seven-car test AGV unit began trials at the Railway test circuit Velim in the Czech Republic on 14 May, 2008, where it is due to stay until the end of the year. All trials of the AGV will be restricted to 210 km/h while at Velim. Alstom Transport Technical Director François Lacote has hinted that if the testing phase in the Czech Republic goes well, testing of Pégase at up to 350 km/h could commence on the LGV Est at the end of 2008. However full European TSI certification for commercial use is not expected to be granted until 2010.See alsoAutorail à grande capacité, a standard-speed multiple unit class of trains used by the SNCFExternal linksAGV tailors capacity and performance to the market Railway Gazette International September 2007&quot;ELISA&quot; to validate Alstom's AGV very high speed train conceptAGV begins dynamic testing Railway Gazette International June 2008ReferencesCategory:High-speed trainsaf:AGV cs:AGV de:Alstom AGV es:Automotrice à grande vitesse fr:Automotrice à grande vitesse it:Automotrice à grande vitesse hu:AGV nl:Automotrice à grande vitesse ja:Automotrice à Grande Vitesse pl:AGV sv:AGV (tåg) zh:AGV
