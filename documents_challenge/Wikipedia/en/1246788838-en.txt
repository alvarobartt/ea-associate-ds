Judge is best known for playing Teal'c in Stargate SG-1. He has written several episodes of Stargate SG-1, most of which deal with crises for his character. He has also done voice acting for animated series and video games, including the voice of Magneto on X-Men: Evolution and the canceled Stargate SG-1: The Alliance. In the season eight episode, "Avatar", Teal'c informs SG-1 that he plays Def Jam Vendetta, alluding to the fact that Chris Judge was a voice actor in that game. He is also known by voicing Jericho on TurokJudge provided the voice of Zodak on the revived He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon. The 2002 redesign of (the originally caucasian) Zodak as an individual of African descent could arguably have been intended to pay homage to Judge, but this is unlikely as the series was based on the revised toyline designed well before Judge's likely casting, and the specific physical resemblance to the actor is minimal.He has three children with his wife Margaret Judge.
