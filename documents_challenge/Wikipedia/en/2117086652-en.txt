KwaZulu was a bantustan in South Africa, intended by the apartheid government as a semi-independent homeland for the Zulu people. The capital, formerly at Nongoma, was moved in 1980 to Ulundi.It was led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Zulu tribe and head of the Inkatha Freedom Party until its abolition in 1994. It was then merged with the surrounding South African province of Natal to form the new province of KwaZulu-Natal.  ==See also==Chief Ministers of KwaZuluCategory:South African bantustans Category:KwaZulu-Natal Provinceca:KwaZulu de:KwaZulu es:KwaZulu eo:Zululando fr:KwaZulu it:KwaZulu he:קוואזולו sw:KwaZulu nl:Kwazoeloe pl:KwaZulu pt:KwaZulu ru:КваЗулу fi:KwaZulu sv:KwaZulu zh:夸祖魯
