Painted by Gerrit von Honthorst in 1634, two years after Frederick's death.]]Frederick V () (August 26 1596 – November 29 1632) was Elector Palatine (1610–23), and, as Frederick I (), King of Bohemia (1619–20, for his short reign here often nicknamed the Winter King, Czech Zimní král). He was the son and heir of Frederick IV and of Louise Juliana of Nassau, the daughter of William I of Orange and Charlotte de Bourbon-Monpensier.Palatine ]] Frederick was born at the Jagdschloss (Hunting Lodge) Deinschwang near Amberg in the Upper Palatinate. In 1610, he - an intellectual, a mystic, and a Calvinist - succeeded his father as Prince-Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate in 1610.In 1618 the Protestant estates of Bohemia rebelled against the Roman Catholic King Ferdinand II and offered the crown of Bohemia to Frederick, chosing him since he was the leader of the Protestant Union, an military alliance founded by his father. Frederick duly accepted the crown, which triggerd the outbreak of the Thirty Years War,Frederick's father-in-law, James I of England, opposed the takeover of Bohemia from the Habsburgs. Additionally, Frederick's allies in the Protestant Union failed to support him militarily by signing the Treaty of Ulm (1620). His brief reign as King of Bohemia ended with his defeat at the Battle of White Mountain on November 8, 1620 — a year and four days after his coronation. This earned him the derisive nickname of 'the Winter King'. After this battle, the Imperial forces invaded Frederick's Palatinate lands and he had flee to Holland in 1622. An Imperial edict formally deprived him of the Palatinate in 1623. He lived the rest of his life in exile with his wife and family, mostly at the Hague, before passing away in Mainz in 1632.His eldest surviving son Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine returned to power in 1648 with the end of the war. His daughter Princess Sophia was eventually named heiress presumptive to the British throne, and was the founder of the Hanoverian line of kings.AncestryFamily and childrenHe married Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of James I of England and of Anne of Denmark in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall on February 14 1613 and had the following children:Frederick Henry (1614–1629)—(drowned)Charles Louis (1617–1680), became Elector Palatine in 1648Elisabeth (1618–1680)Rupert (1619–1682) of English Civil War fame.Maurice (1620–1652) who also served in the English Civil War.Louise Hollandine (1622–1709)Louis (1624–1625)Edward (1625–1663)Henrietta Maria (1626–1651)John Philip Frederick (1627–1650)Charlotte (1628–1631)Sophia (1630–1714), married Elector Ernest Augustus of Hanover; heiress of England by the Act of Settlement, 1701Gustavus Adolphus (1632–1641)ReferencesExternal linksA declaration of the cavses, for the which, wee Frederick, by the grace of God King Bohemia, Covnt Palatine of the Rhine, Elector of the Sacred Empire, & c. haue accepted of the crowne of Bohemia, and of the covntryes thereunto annexed. http://www.aquinas.edu/history/research.html          Category:People of the Thirty Years' War Category:Bohemian monarchs Category:Pretenders to the Bohemian throne Category:House of Palatinate-Simmern Category:Knights of the Garter Category:People from Bavaria Category:Modern child rulers Category:1596 births Category:1632 deathsbg:Фридрих V (Пфалц) ca:Frederic V cs:Fridrich Falcký da:Frederik 5. af Pfalz de:Friedrich V.
