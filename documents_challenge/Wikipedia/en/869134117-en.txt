It is directly north of Toronto, and is part of Toronto's Census Metropolitan Area. Despite its qualifications regarding population, it has not had the title of city conferred upon it by the province, and retains its legal status as a town. Markham is one of the fastest-growing communities in Canada. Markham is also the largest town in Canada Markham is the fourth-most populous municipality in the Greater Toronto Area, after Toronto, Mississauga, and Brampton. Thus, it is home to many cultures. It also claims to be Canada's Hi-Tech Capital with a number of key companies in the area, such as IBM, Motorola, Toshiba, Lucent, Sun Microsystems, Apple, AMEX, and home to the head office of graphics card producer ATI (now part of AMD).History and PresentMarkham was first surveyed as a township in 1793 by William Berczy (Johann Albrecht Ulrich Moll 1744-1813), and settled in 1794.In 1794, William Berczy led 75 German families from New York State to Markham Township, an area known as German Mills today. Each family was granted 200 acres (0.8 km²). Because of hardships, many returned to York (now Toronto) and Niagara. The area became a ghost town.From 1803 to 1812, the largest group of settlers were Pennsylvania Germans, most of whom were Mennonites. These highly skilled craftsmen and knowledgeable farmers had the best chance for survival because they had already survived harsh conditions in Pennsylvania. From 1830 on, many Irish, Scottish and English emigrated to Upper Canada to escape the famine and overpopulation of their homeland.Markham's early years blended the rigours of homesteading with the development of agriculture-based industries. The many rivers and streams in the Township soon supported water-powered saw and grist mills and, later, woollen mills. With improved transportation routes, such as the construction of Yonge Street in the 1800s, along with the growing population, urbanization increased. By 1857 most of the Township had been cleared of timber and was under cultivation. Villages like Thornhill, Unionville and Markham greatly expanded. In 1871, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway company built the first rail line in Markham. This rail line is now used for commuter train services (i.e. GO Trains)The first form of structured municipal government occurred in 1850 when the Township of Markham was created. Markham was then incorporated as a town in 1972.Ever since Markham incorporated as a town, Markham grew quickly as a result of urban sprawl in the Greater Toronto Area. For instance, in 1976 (4 years after Markham's incorporation as a town), Markham's population was approximately 56,000. Since that time, the population has more than quadrupled. Explosive growth in new subdivisions has led to a jump in population since the 1980s. Much of Markham's farmland has disappeared, now mostly found north of Major MacKenzie Drive. Controversy over development of the environmentally sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine will likely curb development of Markham's northern portion.At present, Markham comprises six major communities: Buttonville, Cornell, Markham Village, Milliken, Thornhill, and Unionville. Since the 1980s the town has been recognized as a suburb of Toronto. Many high-tech industries have located in Markham for the relative abundance of land, low tax rates and good transportation routes. ATI Technologies (now known as AMD), IBM Canada, Apple Computer Canada, Motorola Canada and many other well-known companies have chosen Markham as their home in Canada. Hence, the town has been branding itself as Canada's "High-Tech Capital".GeographyMarkham covers 212.47 square kilometres. It is bounded by 5 municipalities. To the west, the town is bounded by Vaughan (boundary is at Yonge Street between Steeles Avenue and Highway 7), and Richmond Hill (boundary is at Highway 7 from Yonge Street to Highway 404 and at Highway 404 from Highway 7 to somewhere between 19th Avenue and Stouffville Road). To the south, Markham is bounded by the City of Toronto (boundary is at Steeles Avenue). To the north, it is bounded by the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville (boundary is from Highway 404 to York-Durham line somewhere between 19th Avenue and Stouffville Road). And to the east, Markham is bounded by the City of Pickering at York-Durham Line. Markham's town centre is at .TopographyMarkham's average altitude is at 200 metres. The town is intersected by two rivers, Don River, and Rouge River, as well as their tributaries. Markham has mainly flat, gently rolling hills. To the north, the Oak Ridges Moraine, which further elevates the elevation towards the north end of the town.ClimateDue to Markham's proximity to Toronto, Markham shares the same climate as Toronto. On an average day, Markham is generally one to two degrees celsius cooler than in Downtown Toronto.DemographicsMarkham has experienced tremendous growth since the 1980s. The Canadian census of 2006 states that the population of Markham in 2006 is 261,573, which is a 25.4% increase from the 2001 census.According to the 2006 census, 65.4% of the population consists of visible minorities. In 2006, the largest racial groups in Markham were:White: 34.4%Chinese: 34.2%South Asian: 17.3%Black: 3.1%Filipino: 2.8%All Others: 8.2%Immigration characteristics (2006):Canadian-born population: 42.6%Foreign-born population: 56.5%Non-permanent residents: 0.9%2006 Community Profiles http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3519036&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Markham&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=&amp;GeoCode=3519036Total population by religion (2001):Catholic: 25.5%Protestant: 20.6%Hindu: 5.7%Muslim: 5.3%Jewish: 5.3%Christian Orthodox: 4.9%Other Christian: 4.3%Buddhist: 3.4%Sikh: 1.6%Other Eastern Religions: 0.2%Other religions: 0.1%No religious affiliation: 23.1%Government.]]The Markham Town Council consists of the mayor, four regional councillors and eight ward councillors, each representing one of the town's eight wards. The mayor of Markham is Frank Scarpitti, who replaced the now retired Donald Cousens, former PC MPP for Markham and Presbyterian church minister). The mayor and four regional councillors are elected by the community to represent the Town of Markham at the regional level.The members of council are elected by the municipality's voters. Councillors are paid by the municipality for their services, but in many municipalities, members of council usually serve part-time and work at other jobs as well.The current members of council were elected by the residents to a four-year term of office, in accordance with standards set by the province. The selection of members for the offices of mayor and regional councillors are made town-wide, while ward councillors are elected by individual ward.The town offices are located at the Markham Civic Centre at Highway 7 (Ontario) and Warden Avenue. The previous offices on Woodbine Avenue have disappeared (a funeral home is on the site), but the historic town hall on Markham Main Street is now a restored office building.The Mayor's Youth Task Force was created to discuss issues facing young people in the town and to plan and publicize events. Its primary purpose is to encourage youth participation within the community.Law and orderThere are no courts in Markham, but the town is served by an Ontario Court of Justice in Newmarket, as well as an Ontario Small Claims court in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The Ontario Court of Appeal is located in Toronto, while the Supreme Court of Canada is located in Ottawa. Policing is provided by York Regional Police at a station (5 District) at the corner of McCowan Road and Carlton Road and Highway 7. Highway 404, Highway 407 and parts of Highway 48 are patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police.Town issuesLike most cities and towns in the Greater Toronto Area, Markham has a few issues it must deal with:Urban growthThere is a desire by the Town to control urban sprawl by requesting higher density for new development. The town plan calls for more growth along Highway 7 and less towards the farm land to the North. A similar development in Cornell promotes the need for services to be closer to residences.Transit planLinked to the concern of urban growth, Markham through York Region Transit (YRT) has implemented a transit system called Viva to ease the strain on the region's congested roads. Viva is similar to YRT but is used as an express bus service with the ability to alter immediate traffic signals so it will not be late. The YRT is also planning to build a transit terminal somewhere near Cornell soon.Markham's neighbourhoods and communitiesMarkham is made up of many communities (many of which, despite being technically suburban districts today, are still signed with official 'entering community' signs on major roads) each with a distinctive character:Angus GlenArmadaleBerczy VillageBox GroveButtonvilleCachetCashelCedar GroveCornellCrosbyDowntown MarkhamDickson's HillGormleyGreensboroughLegacyLocust HillMarkham VillageMilliken MillsQuantztownRaymerville/Markville EastRouge FairwaysSherwood - Amber GlenThornhillUnionvilleVinegar HillWismer CommonsThornhill and Unionville are popularly seen as being separate communities. Thornhill actually straddles the Markham-Vaughan town line (portions of it in both municipalities).ParksCultureUntil the 1970s, Markham was mostly farmland and marsh, which is still reflected in events like the Markham Fair. Today Markham boasts as Canada's High Tech Capital with many new major technology and large corporations choosing to locate their offices within the town. Markham is in the process of building a new downtown, bordered by Kennedy Road, Highway 7, Warden Ave. and the new Enterprise Avenue.

There are local transit services that connect to York University, Ryerson University, University of Ontario Institute of Technology and the University of Toronto, as well as to Toronto campuses of Seneca College, Centennial College, George Brown College, Humber College, The Michener Institute, Durham College and Sheridan College.EconomyIn the 19th century, Markham was a vibrant, independent community with distilleries and breweries around the Highway 7 and 48 intersection. The Speight Wagon Works exported products around the world, and it was said that Markham was more active than York (former name for Toronto) was early on.Today, it claims to be Canada's Hi-Tech Capital with a number of key companies in the area, such as IBM, Motorola, Toshiba, Lucent, Sun Microsystems, Apple Inc., Genesis Microchip, and is home to the head office of graphics card producer ATI (recently merged with AMD).Markham also maintains economic and cultural cooperation agreements with the city of Laval, Quebec (which is the second largest city of the Greater Montreal Area and has a very high financial profile).SportsAttractionsMarkham has retained its historic past in part of the town.
