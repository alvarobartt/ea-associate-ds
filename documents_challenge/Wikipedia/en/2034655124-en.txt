He's donned the shiny suit for various promotional work, including hosting The Making of Star Wars; for appearances on The Muppet Show and Sesame Street; for The Star Wars Holiday Special; for commercials including Kenner toys, a no-smoking PSA, and even a breakfast cereal based on the character; and for prequel tie-ins such as Star Wars Connections and The Science of Star Wars. He also voiced C-3PO in a radio serial based on the original trilogy; for the Christmas-themed Christmas in the Stars album; for the Disneyland theme park attraction Star Tours; and also for two animated series: Droids and Star Wars: Clone Wars. He also provided the narration and all character voices for the Dark Force Rising and The Last Command audio books. Daniels also has a cameo in the Outlander nightclub scene early in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones as a different character, Lieutenant Dannl Faytonni, the man in blue uniform who can be seen in a cutaway reaction shot after Obi-Wan disarms the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Faytonni can also be seen at the Galaxies Opera House in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.Daniels was the voice of Legolas in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. He crops up intermittently on British TV in various dramas, notably in a recurring role in Prime Suspect starring Helen Mirren. He also played the priest in the 1990 British spoof horror film I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle. Aside from his more commercial works Daniels has been appearing and producing many art house and experimental films. His first self produced short film was in 1984 titled My Eye followed by Rupert is a Robot. His last film I'm Marrying C3P0 was shown at the Bognor Regis Film Festival in 2006.Behind the ScenesAnthony Daniels was never a science fiction fan. The only science fiction movie he ever saw in a theatre was 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). He was so dissatisfied with the movie that he walked out after only ten minutes and demanded his money back.He was the only cast member of the Star Wars trilogy to voice his character in all three episodes of National Public Radio's dramatizations of the Star Wars trilogy (while Mark Hamill voiced Luke Skywalker for both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, and Billy Dee Williams voiced Lando Calrissian for The Empire Strikes Back, when the Return of the Jedi adaptation was recorded many years later, Hamill and Williams were replaced by Joshua Fardon and Arye Gross, respectively).Daniels also contributed the foreword to the collected scripts of the Return of the Jedi radio drama, as their author Brian Daley died just as the episodes were being recorded. Daniels' other Star Wars-related writings include the Wonder Column for Star Wars Insider magazine and a comic book adventure for C-3PO and R2-D2 entitled The Protocol Offensive, published by Dark Horse Comics.As C-3PO, he says the first line in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, first released in 1977 and part of what is known as the Original Trilogy, and the last line in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, released in 2005 and part of the Prequel Trilogy.In The Phantom Menace, Daniels did the voice work for C-3PO but did not physically appear in the movie, as the character was a puppet instead of a costume - a prototype C-3PO controlled by someone else. He actually controlled the puppet for 2002's Episode II: Attack of the Clones, but all prototype scenes were cut, with the droid's first appearance in the movie being Daniels in costume. In this movie and 2005's Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, he also dubbed the vocal tracks for some scenes that used CGI.Other careersHe also read the first half of Ann Jungman's Vlad the Drac books for audiobook, before being replaced by Brian Cant for the second half.ReferencesExternal linksOfficial websiteMultimedia Q&amp;A with Daniels from the BBC website for the Ghosts of Albion Category:English film actors Category:English television actors Category:English voice actors Category:Old Giggleswickians Category:People from Salisburyde:Anthony Daniels es:Anthony Daniels fr:Anthony Daniels it:Anthony Daniels nl:Anthony Daniels ja:アンソニー・ダニエルズ no:Anthony Daniels (skuespiller) pl:Anthony Daniels sq:Anthony Daniels fi:Anthony Daniels sv:Anthony Daniels tr:Anthony Daniels
