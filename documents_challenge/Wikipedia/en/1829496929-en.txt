It is controlled by the Uzbekistan Football Federation and is a member of the Asian Football Confederation.After the split from the Soviet Union, they played their first match against Tajikistan on June 17, 1992. Uzbekistan have consistently been the strongest team out of the new Central Asian nations (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan). They won the Asian Games in 1994.OverviewThey were knocked out in the final stage of Asian qualification to the 2006 FIFA World Cup after losing on the away goals rule to Bahrain. The result was subject to controversy as actually three games were played; the first, a 1-0 win for Uzbekistan, was wiped out after FIFA declared the result void after a mistake by a Japanese referee. The replay ended 1-1, and after the return finished 0-0, Uzbekistan were eliminated.In the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, Uzbekistan was able to get past the group stage by beating Malaysia 5-0 and China 3-0. However, Uzbekistan was knocked out of the tournament in the quarterfinals stage by losing to Saudi Arabia 2-1.Competition historyWorld Cup record1998 to 2006 - Did not qualify2010 - Qualifiers underwayThe strongest of the five former Soviet Republics to have joined the Asian Football Confederation, Uzbekistan will be keen to live up to the promise they showed in winning the 1994 Asian Games when they open their qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™. They have a two-legged encounter against Chinese Taipei on 8 and 28 October.The central Asian side delivered a shock by clinching gold in the 1994 tournament as debutants, but since then they have failed to make an impact on the continental stage. That was until they stormed into the last eight of the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, where they were only edged out by Bahrain after a penalty shoot-out.That morale-boosting performance was followed by an even more sensational victory over Iraq in the second qualifying round for Germany 2006, with goals from Maksim Shatskikh and Alexander Geynrikh sending them through to the last eight. Pitted against the likes of Saudi Arabia and Korea Republic in the final qualifying round, they managed a third-placed finish that set up a play-off against Bahrain, who once again advanced at their expense.After sticking with a foreign-coach policy over three years, which saw German coach Hans Jurgen Gede, Englishman Bob Houghton and Russian Vladimir Nepomniatchi at the helm, Uzbekistan have come full circle, turning to home-grown Rauf Inileev.The former Uzbekistan Olympic team coach made radical changes to the team, keeping only eight veterans of the 2004 squad while injecting new blood in the shape of five Under-23 players. Despite missing a number of experienced figures, including influential former captain Mirdjalal Kasimov who retired last year, Inileev successfully moulded the new-look team into a strong squad.Ace striker, Dynamo Kiev hotshot Maksim Shatskikh, is still in his goal-scoring prime and striking prodigy Geynrikh has come of age, developing into the team's lethal weapon particularly when sent on as a super-sub. In the central areas, Server Djeparov has taken over much of the creative duties since Kasimov retired while at the back young Aziz Ibragimov has quickly developed a solid defensive partnership alongside experienced Hayrulla Karimov and Aleksey Nikolaev.In the qualifying series for the FIFA World Cup, however, Uzbekistan have been imperious, advancing to the fourth round of Asian qualifying after only four matches with a perfect record, inlcuding a 3-0 thrashing of Saudi Arabia. Although the Saudis defeated them in the return encounter. In the past 3 rounds, Uzbekistan has managed to score 26 goals, so far it's the best result in World Cup Qualifiers. Uzbekistan will be a team that all the other teams in the Asian final ten will be hoping to avoid.Asian Cup record1956 to 1992 - Did not enter, was part of USSR1996 - Round 12000 - Round 12004 - Quarterfinals2007 - QuarterfinalsDateTournamentLocationOpponentResultScorers15 October 2008World Cup 2010]]Japan TokyoJapan Japan10 October 2008FriendlySouth Korea SeoulSouth Korea Korea Republic10 September 2008World Cup 2010]]Uzbekistan TashkentAustralia AustraliaLost 0:16 September 2008World Cup 2010]]Qatar DohaQatar QatarLost 3:029 August 2008FriendlyUzbekistan Tashkent Korea DPRDraw 0:020 August 2008FriendlyOman MuscatOman OmanLost 2:022 June 2008World Cup 2010]]Saudi Arabia RiyadhSaudi Arabia Saudi ArabiaLost 4:014 June 2008World Cup 2010]]Uzbekistan TashkentLebanon LebanonWon 3:0Ahmedov 50', 60'; Djeparov 90+4'7 June 2008World Cup 2010]]Uzbekistan TashkentSingapore SingaporeWon 1:0Geynrikh 80'2 June 2008World Cup 2010]]Singapore SingaporeSingapore SingaporeWon 7:3Kapadze 10'; Karpenko 21'; Djeparov 34', 44'; Denisov 42'; Ibragimov 62'; Shatskikh 88'26 March 2008World Cup 2010]]Uzbekistan TashkentSaudi Arabia Saudi ArabiaWon 3:0Kapadze 46+; Shatskikh 66'; Djeparov 68' PK22 March 2008FriendlyUzbekistan TashkentJordan JordanWon 4:1Djeparov 4', Inomov 36', F.Tadjiyev 50', Z.Tadjiyev 63'6 February 2008World Cup 2010]]Lebanon BeirutLebanon LebanonWon 1:0Ahmedov 44'24 December 2007FriendlyThailand BangkokNorth Korea North KoreaDrew 2:2Solomin 53', Yafarov 65'22 December 2007FriendlyThailand BangkokThailand ThailandLost 3:2Tadjiyev 44',60'21 November 2007FriendlyUzbekistan TashkentEstonia EstoniaDrew 0:028 October 2007Chinese Taipei TaipeiChinese Taipei TaiwanWon 2:0Inomov 79', Suyunov 90'13 October 2007Uzbekistan TashkentChinese Taipei TaiwanWon 9:0Shatskikh 5',17',35',67',78'; Kapadze 26'; Karpenko 45'; Bakaev 56'; Salomov 69'22 August 2007FriendlyUkraine KievUkraine UkraineLost 1:2Geynrich 90'22 July 2007Indonesia JakartaSaudi Arabia Saudi ArabiaLost 1:2Solomin 82'18 July 2007Malaysia Kuala LumpurChina ChinaWon 3:0Shatskikh 72', Kapadze 86', Geynrikh 90+4'14 July 2007Malaysia Kuala LumpurMalaysia MalaysiaWon 5:0Shatskikh 10',89' , Kapadze 29', Bakaev 45'(pen), Ibragimov 85'11 July 2007Malaysia Kuala LumpurIran IranLost 2:1Rezaei 16'(o.g.)5 July 2007South Korea SeoulSouth Korea KoreaLost 2:1Djeparov 60'PK2 July 2007South Korea PajuIraq IraqWon 0:2Ibragimov 3', Bakaev 73'
