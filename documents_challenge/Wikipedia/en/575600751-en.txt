The Klipspringer (literally "rock jumper" in Afrikaans), Oreotragus oreotragus, also known colloquially as a mvundla (from Xhosa "umvundla", meaning "rabbit"), is a small African antelope that lives from the Cape of Good Hope all the way up East Africa and into Ethiopia.Reaching approximately 58cm (22 inches) at the shoulder, Klipspringers are relatively small animals compared to some of their larger antelope cousins. Only the males have horns that are usually about 20-25cm (4-6 inches) long. They stand on the tips of their hooves.With a thick and dense speckled "salt and pepper" patterned coat of an almost olive shade, Klipspringers blend in well with the kopje (rock outcrops, pronounced "kah-pee") on which they can usually be found.Klipspringers are herbivores, eating rock plants. They never need to drink, since the succulents they subsist on provide them with enough water to survive.The mating season for Klipspringers is from September through to January. The gestation period is about 214 days.Category:Dwarf antelopes Category:Mammals of Africa Category:Fauna of South Africa Category:Fauna of Ethiopia Category:Fauna of Namibia Category:Fauna of Sudan Category:Fauna of Angola Category:Fauna of East Africa Category:Mammals of Kenya Category:Fauna of Tanzania Category:Fauna of ZambiaReferencesKlipspringer at Animal Diversity Web cs:Skálolez skákavý de:Klippspringer es:Oreotragus oreotragus fr:Oréotrague it:Oreotragus oreotragus lt:Antilopė šoklė hu:Szassza nl:Klipspringer ja:クリップスプリンガー pl:Koziołek skalny pt:Oreotragus oreotragus fi:Kalliohyppijä sv:Klippspringare zh:山羚
