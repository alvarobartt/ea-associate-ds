Funded from a combination of a television licence fees and revenue from limited on-air advertising, ORF is the dominant player in the Austrian broadcast media.http://www.circom-regional.org/crdocs/european-benchmarking2002.pdf Austria was the last country in Europe after Albania to allow national private television.History of broadcasting in Austria]]The first test transmissions in Austria were made in 1923 by Radio Hekaphon, run by a technical school in Vienna. It was, however, the publicly owned RAVAG &ndash; Radio-Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft, "Radio Communication Company Ltd" &ndash; which, in February 1924, was awarded the concession to begin broadcasting, with the radio pioneer and enthusiast Oskar Czeja as its Director-General. Regular transmissions began on 1 October 1924 from studios inside the Ministry of Armed Forces building that were to become known as "Radio Wien". By the end of October 1924 the station already had 30,000 listeners, and by January 1925 100,000. Relay transmitters, established across the country by 1934, ensured that all Austrians could listen to Radio Wien.With the Anschluss in 1938, RAVAG was eliminated and Radio Wien was made subordinate to the Reichsrundfunk in Berlin. Following Germany's defeat in 1945, independent Austrian radio broadcasting was re-established, and a new "Radio Wien" was founded, once again under Oskar Czeijas. A number of other radio stations began broadcasting in the different occupation zones and radio become a popular medium among Austrians: in 1952 there were 1.5 million radio sets in Austrian homes. In 1955 the various regional stations were brought together as the Österreichisches Rundspruchwesen ("Austrian Broadcasting Entity") which later, in 1958, became the Österreichischer Rundfunk GmbH, forerunner of today's ORF.Radio channelsof Vienna: chiefly a production centre for the making of radio programmes]]Ö1 - ORF's cultural and principal news channelHitradio Ö3 - pop music channelFM4 - channel for (alternative) youth cultureThe former Ö2 has been replaced by nine regional channels (one for each Bundesland):Radio BurgenlandRadio KärntenRadio NiederösterreichRadio OberösterreichRadio SalzburgRadio SteiermarkRadio TirolRadio VorarlbergRadio WienAll of these radio channels are broadcast terrestrially on FM and via the digital service of the Astra satellite system.An additional service, Radio 1476, is broadcast on medium-wave in the evenings between 18.00 and just after midnight.
