Although the other models were executive cars, the Croma was marketed in the large family car segment, replacing the Fiat Argenta.Production ceased in 1996, and Fiat abandoned the large family car segment. The Bravo/Brava-based Fiat Marea small family car replaced the Croma and Tempra as the largest saloon and estate in Fiat's model range.EnginesFiat Croma was the first passenger car in the world to have direct injection Diesel (Turbo D i.d.) engine in (1986). The Croma was available with a variety of petrol and diesel engines, the former from the Fiat DOHC engine family. Base models had the 1585&nbsp;cc, 83&nbsp;PS (61&nbsp;kW) and 1995&nbsp;cc, 90&nbsp;PS (66&nbsp;kW) "Controlled High Turbulence" powerplants, followed by two fuel injected 2.0&nbsp;L units, one with 120&nbsp;PS (88&nbsp;kW) and the other a turbocharged and intercooled version giving 153&nbsp;PS (113&nbsp;kW). Diesel engines were the Fiat's 1.9&nbsp;L fitted with a turbocharger with direct injection, giving 92&nbsp;PS (68&nbsp;kW), and the 2499&nbsp;cc unit supplied by VM Motori, with a normally aspirated version giving 75&nbsp;PS (55&nbsp;kW) and a turbocharged one with 115&nbsp;PS (85&nbsp;kW). This one replaced the previous 2446&nbsp;cc with 100&nbsp;PS (74&nbsp;kW). The 2.5 L petrol V6 unit was from Alfa Romeo.ModelEngineDisplacementPower1600I4]] DOHC 8V1585 cc832000 CHTI4]] DOHC 8V1995 cc902000 CHTI4]] DOHC 8V1995 cc1012000 i.e.I4]] DOHC 8V1995 cc1132000 i.e.I4]] DOHC 8V1995 cc1162000 i.e.I4]] DOHC 8V1995 cc1202000 i.e. 16VI4]] DOHC 16V1995 cc1372000 i.e. TurboI4]] DOHC 8V1995 cc1502500V6 DOHC 12V2492 cc160| valign="top"|DieselModelEngineDisplacementPower1900 Turbo D i.d.I4]] SOHC 8V1929 cc922500 DI4]] SOHC 8V2499 cc752500 TDI4]] SOHC 8V2499 cc1012500 TDI4]] SOHC 8V2499 cc1162500 TDEI4]] SOHC 8V2499 cc105| == Second generation (2005-present) ==  | length =  (facelift) | width =  | height =  | related = Cadillac BLSChevrolet MalibuPontiac G6Opel SignumOpel VectraSaab 9-3Saturn Aura | similar = Ford S-MAXCitroÃ«n Grand C4 Picasso | designer = Giorgetto Giugiaro   In 2005, Fiat announced a large cross-over wagon with an upright tailgate, reminiscent of that of the Fiat Stilo, resurrecting the Croma nameplate. Again, Giugiaro styled the exterior, while the chassis was provided via the short-lived link with General Motors. The new Croma is therefore based on the GM Epsilon platform sharing components with the Opel Vectra and Saab 9-3. It went on sale in Italy in June 2005.Unlike the previous model, and aware of its lack of image in the upper market segments, Fiat opted for not developing a standard large family car but developing a "Comfort Wagon" Car Reviews: First Drives: Fiat Croma - Autoexpress, an automobile with design elements of both estates and large MPVs. Its height of 1600&nbsp;mm falls between the Mitsubishi Grandis and Ford S-MAX large MPVs (1655&nbsp;mm and 1660&nbsp;mm respectively) and Toyota Avensis Wagon (1525&nbsp;mm).In February 2007, Fiat UK announced that the Croma would no longer be generally available in the UK, after less than 900 were sold in the whole of 2005. The car will still be offered by special order only, with right-hand drive models manufactured to customer specifications.SafetyThe Croma is manufactured with seven airbags as standard including knee bag for the driver. It is also built with pioneering electronics to help the driver keep control of the car in every situation. As standard the Croma is equipped with anti-lock braking system and electronic brakeforce distribution. It has a five-star EuroNCAP crash rating for adult occupant protection:Adult occupant = Child occupant = Pedestrian = 2007 faceliftThe Croma got a minor facelift at the end of 2007. A new grille (Bravo look) and rear bumper, as well as some material changes inside are the main differencies. Fiat now designates the revised model as "Station Wagon" instead of the previously used term "Comfort Wagon".EnginesThe Croma, built at Fiat's Cassino factory, has three trim levels and five engine options. Like the chassis, petrol engines were supplied by Opel, beginning with the brand new evolution of the Ecotec 1.8&nbsp;L with 140&nbsp;PS (103&nbsp;kW), followed by the torquier 2.2&nbsp;L with 147&nbsp;PS (108&nbsp;kW). However, the bulk of the sales is represented by Fiat's own Multijet engine, available in three variants 1.9&nbsp;L with 8 valves and 120&nbsp;PS (88&nbsp;kW), 1.9&nbsp;L with 16 valves and 150&nbsp;PS (110&nbsp;kW), and the range topper five-cylinder 2.4&nbsp;L, with 200&nbsp;PS (147&nbsp;kW). The Diesel engines are fitted with a standard six-speed manual gearbox, 6-speed automatic is also available.PetrolModelEngineDisplacementPowerTorque1,8 MPI 16VI4]] DOHC 16V1796 cc140 @6300 rpm175 @3800 rpm2,2 MPI 16VI4]] DOHC 16V2198 cc147 @5800 rpm203 @4000 rpmDieselModelEngineDisplacementPowerTorque1,9 MultiJet 8VI4]] DOHC 8V1910 cc120 @4000 rpm280 @2000 rpm1,9 MultiJet 16VI4]] DOHC 16V1910 cc150 @4000 rpm320 @2000 rpm2,4 MultiJet 20VI5]] DOHC 20V2387 cc200 @4000 rpm400 @2000 rpmReferencesExternal linksThe Fiat CromaEuroNCAP resultsCroma Category:Mid-size cars Fiat Croma#Second generation .282005-present.29 Category:Front wheel drive vehicles Category:1980s automobiles Category:1990s automobiles Category:2000s automobiles Category:Vehicles introduced in 1985 Category:Vehicles introduced in 2005cs:Fiat Croma da:Fiat Croma de:Fiat Croma es:Fiat Croma fr:Fiat Croma it:Fiat Croma nl:Fiat Croma pl:Fiat Croma pt:Fiat Croma simple:Fiat Croma fi:Fiat Croma sv:Fiat Croma tr:Fiat Croma
