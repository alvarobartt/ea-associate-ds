The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) is a species of owl which breeds in Europe, Asia, and North America. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, family Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping of owls are the barn owls, family Tytonidae.AppearanceThe Long-eared Owl is a medium sized owl, 31-37 cm in length with an 86-98 cm wingspan. It has erect blackish ear-tufts, which are positioned in the center of the head. The female is larger in size and darker in colouration than the male. The Long-eared Owl’s brownish feathers are vertically streaked. Tarsus and toes are entirely feathered. Eye disks are also characteristic in this species. However, the eye disks of A. otus are darker in color or rusty-orange. This nocturnal species is perhaps most easily seen perched in a tree in its daytime roost.BehaviourThe Long-eared Owl's breeding season is from February to July. This bird is partially migratory, moving south in winter from the northern parts of its temperate range. Its habitat is forest close to open country.It nests in trees, often coniferous, using the old stick nests of other birds such as crows, ravens and magpies and various hawks. The average clutch size is 4-6 eggs, and the incubation time averages from 25-30 days. It will readily use artificial nesting baskets. An unusual characteristic of this species is its communal nesting in thickets during the winter months.The Long-eared Owl hunts over open country by night. It is very long winged, like the similar Short-eared Owl, and glides slowly on stiff wings when hunting. Its food is mainly rodents, small mammals, and birds.References Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concernExternal linksLong-eared Owl Species Account - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenterLong-eared Owl - &lt;i&gt;Asio otus&lt;/i&gt; - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenterLong-eared Owl Information and Photos - South Dakota Birds and BirdingInformation Link with PicturesPictures and Listen to AudioClose up Picture of Long-earred Owl face[http://ibc.hbw.com/ibc/phtml/especie.phtml?idEspecie=2743 Asio otus videos] on the Internet Bird Collection&quot;Northern Long-eared Owl&quot; Stamps - (16 issues) with Circum-Polar MapLong-eared Owl photo gallery - VIREOAgeing and sexing (PDF) by Javier Blasco-ZumetaCategory:Asio Category:Birds of Pakistan Category:Birds of prey Owl, Long-eared Owl, Long-eared Owl, Long-eared Owl, Long-earedbg:Горска ушата сова ca:Mussol banyut cs:Kalous ušatý cy:Tylluan Gorniog da:Skovhornugle de:Waldohreule et:Kõrvukräts es:Asio otus eo:Orelstrigo fr:Hibou moyen-duc fy:Hoarnûle gl:Bufo pequeno it:Asio otus he:ינשוף עצים ka:ოლოლი ku:Kundê gora lt:Mažasis apuokas hu:Erdei fülesbagoly ms:Burung Hantu Telinga Panjang nl:Ransuil nds-nl:Katoele ja:トラフズク no:Hornugle pl:Sowa uszata pt:Coruja-pequena ru:Ушастая сова se:Bealljeloađgu sk:Myšiarka ušatá sl:Mala uharica sr:Мала ушара fi:Sarvipöllö sv:Hornuggla tr:Kulaklı orman baykuşu uk:Сова вухата zh:长耳鸮
