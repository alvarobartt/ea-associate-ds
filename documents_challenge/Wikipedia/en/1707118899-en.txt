Calendula officinalis, known as Pot Marigold or English Marigold, is a plant in the Calendula genus. It was used in ancient Greek, Roman, Arabic and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb as well as a dye for fabrics, foods and cosmetics.The leaves and petals of the Pot Marigold are edible, with the petals added to dishes as a garnish and in lieu of saffron. The leaves can be sweet but are more commonly bitter, and may be used in salads.Calendula officinalis is a cultivated herb and can be grown easily in sunny locations in most kinds of soils. PharmacologyCalendula officinalis is used for the treatment of skin disorders and pain, and as a bactericide, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. The petals and pollen contain triterpenoid esters (an anti-inflammatory) and the carotenoids flavoxanthin and auroxanthin (antioxidants, and the source of the yellow-orange coloration). The leaves and stems contain other carotenoids, mostly lutein (80%) and zeaxanthin (5%), and beta-carotene. Plant extracts are also widely used by cosmetics, presumably due to presence of compounds such as saponins, resins and essential oils.ReferencesExternal linksCategory:Asteraceae Category:Leaf vegetables Category:Garden plants Category:Medicinal plantsbg:Невен ca:Boixac de jardí cs:Měsíček lékařský da:Have-Morgenfrue de:Ringelblume et:Harilik saialill es:Calendula officinalis eo:Kalendulo fa:گل همیشه‌بهار fr:Souci officinal hsb:Smjerdnička hr:Neven lv:Kliņģerīte lt:Vaistinė medetka hu:Körömvirág nl:Goudsbloem ja:キンセンカ no:Ringblomst pl:Nagietek lekarski ru:Ноготки лекарственные sq:Kalendula mjekësore sk:Nechtík lekársky sl:Vrtni ognjič sr:Невен (биљка) fi:Tarhakehäkukka sv:Ringblomma ur:گل اشرفی bat-smg:Nadatka zh:金盞花
