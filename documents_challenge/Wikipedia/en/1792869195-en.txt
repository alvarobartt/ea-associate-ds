 River dolphins are four living species of dolphin which reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They are classed in the Platanistoidea superfamily of cetaceans. Three species live in fresh water rivers. The fourth species, the La Plata Dolphin, lives in salt-water estuaries and near-shore marine environments. However, it is scientifically classed in the river dolphin family rather than the oceanic dolphin family.EcologyRiver dolphins are now facing extinction due to habitat loss, hunting by humans, and naturally low numbers. Also, many river dolphins possess very poor eyesight -- some are considered blind -- which can lead to unfortunate encounters with humans or human-made objects (boats or fishing nets, for example).Some dolphin species can live in marine or riverine environments. The Tucuxi, for example, is equally at home in both ecotypes. However, these are not classified in the Platanistoidea superfamily and are therefore not regarded as true river dolphins. Juvenile river dolphins are grey and turn pink at maturity.TaxonomyIn the most recent classification (Rice, 1998) there are currently four extant families that make up the river dolphins. However, a December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotidae (commonly known as the Yangtze River dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct,[http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/15782wq480207749/ Turvey et al], Journal of the Royal Society, Biology Letters (2007 Aug. 7). All Headline News, Dec. 2006. Platanistidae is listed as the only extant family of the Platanistoidea superfamily. The previously accepted classification treated all four families as belonging to this family and treated the Ganges and Indus River Dolphins as separate species.Classification by Rice (1998)Superfamily PlatanistoideaFamily PlatanistidaeGanges and Indus River Dolphin, Platanista gangeticaFamily IniidaeAmazon River Dolphin (or Boto), Inia geoffrensisFamily LipotidaeChinese River Dolphin (or Baiji), Lipotes vexillifer (possibly extinct, since December 2006)Family PontoporiidaeLa Plata Dolphin (or Franciscana), Pontoporia blainvilleiPrevious classificationFamily PlatanistidaeGanges River Dolphin, Platanista gangeticaIndus River Dolphin, Platanista minorAmazon River Dolphin (or Boto), Inia geoffrensisChinese River Dolphin (or Baiji), Lipotes vexillifer (presumed extinct as of 2006La Plata Dolphin (or Franciscana), Pontoporia blainvilleiExtinctionOn Dec. 13th, 2006, the Yangtze River Dolphin, or Baiji, was declared "functionally extinct", after a 45-day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7005844811. The last verified sighting of the beak-nosed dolphin was in September of 2004. http://www.baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/1206_release_YFDE.pdf However, in August, 2007, reports surfaced that a man saw and videotaped what appears to be a baiji in the Yangtze River. A team of scientists attempted to verify the sighting beginning in September, 2007. http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-08-29-china-dolphin_N.htmIt is believed that overfishing, damming and sub-aquatic sonar pollution (which interfered with the dolphin's sonar-based method of locating food), led to the extinction. Reuters news reported this their first record of a mammalian extinction in 50 years.NotesReferencesReeves, Randall R. et al. (2002). National Audubon Society guide to marine mammals of the world.
