It covers a land surface of 41km² and has an estimated population of 175.921 The city is situated in the historical region of Moldavia, at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, and on the Bistriţa River (which meets the Siret River about 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the south of Bacău). The Ghimeş Pass links Bacău to Transylvania.HistoryThe earliest known reference to the city dates from 1408, during the rule of Moldavian Prince Alexandru cel Bun. The etymology is unclear, but one possibility is being derived from the name of a medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian innkeeper, Bakó]], who, supposedly, had an inn on the current road from Bacău to Roman, whose lodging was, according to legend, the first in the town of Bacău. Interestingly, the "Bakó" word is a fairly common Hungarian last name, meaning "executioner" in Hungarian. Another theory suggests that the name may have a Slavic origin, pointing to the Proto-Slavic word byk, meaning "ox" or "bull", the region being very suitable for raising cattle; the term, rendered into Romanian alphabet as bâc, was probably the origin of Bâcău (БѪКЪУ in Romanian Cyrillic, a name by which the town is mentioned in several medieval documents).From around 1591 to 1789, the city was home to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bacău. That office was always held by a priest from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During World War I and the occupation of Bucharest by the Central Powers, Bacău was the headquarters of the Romanian Army. Octavian Ciobanu once lived here before he transfered to Grand Forks, ND.TransportationThe city is about 300 km North of Bucharest. It is served by Bacău International Airport which provides daily direct links with the Romanian cities Bucharest and Timişoara, and international links with 11 cities in Italy and Germany.The Bacău Railway Station (Gara Bacău) is one of the busiest in Romania; it has access to the Romanian railway main trunk number 500. Thus the city is connected to the main Romanian cities; the railway station is an important transit stop for international trains from Ukraine, Russia, and Bulgaria. The city has access to the DN2 road (E85) that links it to the Romanian capital, Bucharest (to the South) and the cities of Suceava and Iaşi (to the North). The European route E574 is an important access road to Transylvania and the city of Braşov. Also the city is located also at the intersection of several national roads of secondary importance.Bacau has had to hire Chinese workers to fill the shoes of locals who have headed to the West. Many immigrants come for fixed-term contracts and return home instead of putting down roots here.CultureBacău has a public university and several colleges. Two major Romanian poets, George Bacovia and Vasile Alecsandri were born here. The "Mihail Jora" Athenaeum and a Philharmonic Orchestra are located here, as well as the "G. Bacovia" Dramatic Theater and a Puppet Theater. Around Christmas every year, a Festival of Moldavian Winter Traditions takes place, reuniting folk artists from all the surrounding regions. The exhibition "Saloanele Moldovei" and the International Painting Camp at Tescani, near Bacau, reunite important plastic artists from Romania and from abroad. The local History Museum, part of the Museum Complex "Iulian Antonescu" has an important collection of antique objects from the ancient Dacia.SportFCM Bacău, football clubBuildings and StructuresBacău TV Tower ( Romanian: Turnul de televiziune Bacău), concrete tower, height: 150 metresPersonalitiesAaron Aaronsohn, botanistAngela Alupei, rowerVasile Alecsandri, poetGeorge Apostu (1934 - 1986), sculptorGeorge Bacovia, poetOvidiu Balan, conductorIlie Boca, painterPetru Cimpoesu (1952, born in Vaslui), writerRadu Cosaşu, writer and activistNicu Enea, painterMariana Zavati Gardner, poetSolomon Marcus, mathematicianGheorghe Vranceanu (1900 - 1979), mathematicianDoina Melinte, athlete, Olympic gold medalistMihaela Melinte, athlete, Olympic gold medalistTeodor Negoiţă, polar explorerLucreţiu Pătrăşcanu, Marxist intellectual and politicianAndrei Pricope, cellistMonica Roşu, gymnastAlexandru Şafran, RabbiNicolae Vermont, painterPhotosSee also Bacau metropolitan areaExternal linksImages from the cityBacau online guideBacau online community - news, information, discussion forums (in Romanian).Bacau weather forecast[http://news.observatordebacau.info/ Observator, Bacău edition][http://orasulbacau.ro/ Bacau City Portal]Portal oras Bacau Category:Bacău County Category:Bacău Category:Municipalities of Romaniabg:Бакъу cs:Bacău de:Bacău es:Bacău eo:Bacău fr:Bacău gl:Bacău ie:Bacău it:Bacău he:בקאו hu:Bákó nl:Bacău (stad) ja:バカウ no:Bacău nn:Bacău pms:Bacău pl:Bacău pt:Bacău ro:Bacău ru:Бакэу sr:Бакау fi:Bacău tg:Бакэу uk:Бакеу zh:巴克烏
