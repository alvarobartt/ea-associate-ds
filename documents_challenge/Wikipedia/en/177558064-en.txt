In linear algebra, Jordan normal form (often called Jordan canonical form) Shilov defines the term Jordan canonical form and in a footnote says that Jordan normal form is synonymous. These terms are sometimes shortened to Jordan form. (Shilov) The term Classical canonical form is also sometimes used in the sense of this article. (James & James, 1976)  shows that a given square matrix M'' over a field ''K containing the eigenvalues of M'' can be transformed into a certain normal form by changing the basis. This normal form is ''almost diagonal in the sense that its only non-zero entries lie on the diagonal and the superdiagonal. This is made more precise in the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition. One can compare this result with the spectral theorem for normal matrices, which is a special case of the Jordan normal form.It is named in honor of Camille Jordan.MotivationAn n'' &times; ''n matrix A'' is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is ''n. Or, equivalently, if and only if A'' has ''n linearly independent eigenvectors. Not all matrices are diagonalizable. Consider the following matrix:A =\begin5 &amp;  4 &amp;  2 &amp;  1 \\
0 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\1 & -1 & 3 & 0 \\1 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp;  2\end.Including multiplicity, the eigenvalues of A'' are λ = 1, 2, 4, 4. The dimension of the kernel of ''A&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4'I' is 1, so A'' is not diagonalizable. However, there is an invertible matrix ''P such that A'' = ''PJP&minus;1, whereJ = \begin1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end.The matrix J is almost diagonal. This is the Jordan normal form of A''. The section [[#Example|''Example]] below fills in the details of the computation.Complex matricesIn general, a square complex matrix A is similar to a block diagonal matrixJ = \beginJ_1 & \; & \; \\ \; & \ddots & \; \\ \; & \; & J_p\endwhere each block Ji is a square matrix of the formJ_i =\begin \lambda_i & 1 & \; & \; \\ \; & \lambda_i & \ddots & \; \\ \; & \; & \ddots & 1 \\ \; & \; & \; & \lambda_i \end.So there exists an invertible matrix P'' such that ''P-1AP = J'' is such that the only non-zero entries of ''J are on the diagonal and the super-diagonal. J'' is called the '''Jordan normal form' of A''. Each ''Ji'' is called a Jordan block of ''A. In a given Jordan block, every entry on the super-diagonal is 1.Assuming this result, we can deduce the following properties:Counting multiplicity, the eigenvalues of J'', therefore ''A, are the diagonal entries.Given an eigenvalue λi'', its '''geometric multiplicity' is the dimension of Ker(A'' &minus; λ''i I), and it is the number of Jordan blocks corresponding to λi.The sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks corresponding to an eigenvalue λi'' is its '''algebraic multiplicity'.A'' is diagonalizable if and only if, for any eigenvalue λ of ''A, its geometric and algebraic multiplicities coincide.Notice that the Jordan block corresponding to λ is of the form λ I + N'', where ''N is a nilpotent matrix defined as N''''ij = δi'',''j&minus;1 (where δ is the Kronecker delta). The nilpotency of N'' can be exploited when calculating ''f(A'') where ''f is a complex analytic function. For example, in principle the Jordan form could give a closed-form expression for the exponential exp(A).Generalized eigenvectorsConsider the matrix A'' from the example in the previous section. The Jordan normal form is obtained by some similarity transformation ''P&minus;1AP = J, i.e.AP = PJ.Let P'' have column vectors ''pi'', ''i = 1, ..., 4, thenA \begin p_1 & p_2 & p_3 & p_4 \end = \begin p_1 & p_2 & p_3 & p_4 \end\begin 5 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 5 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end.We see that\; (A - 5 I) p_1 = 0 and\; (A - 5 I) p_i = p_ \mbox i = 2, \; 3, \;4.For i'' = 1, we have ''p1 ∈ Ker(A'' &minus; 5'I'), i.e. ''p1 is an eigenvector of A'' corresponding to the eigenvalue 5. For ''i = 2, 3 and 4, however, p''''i ∈ Ker(A'' &minus; 5'I')''i. Such vectors are called generalized eigenvectors of A.Thus, given an eigenvalue λ, its corresponding Jordan block gives rise to a Jordan chain. The generator, or lead vector, say pr, of the chain is a generalized eigenvector such that (A'' &minus; λ '''I')r''''pr'' = 0, where ''r is the size of the Jordan block. The vector p''1 = (''A &minus; λ I')''r&minus;1p''''r is an eigenvector corresponding to λ. In general, p''''i is a preimage of p''''i&minus;1 under A &minus; λ '''I. So the lead vector generates the chain via mutiplication by (A'' &minus; λ '''I').Therefore, the statement that every square matrix A'' can be put in Jordan normal form is equivalent to the claim that there exists a basis consisting only of eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors of ''A.A proofWe give a proof by induction. The 1 &times; 1 case is trivial. Let A'' be an ''n &times; n'' matrix. Take any eigenvalue λ of ''A. The range of A'' &minus; λ '''I', denoted by Ran(A'' &minus; λ '''I'), is an invariant subspace of A''. Also, since λ is an eigenvalue of ''A, the dimension Ran(A'' &minus; λ '''I'), r'', is strictly less than ''n. Let A' '' denote the restriction of ''A to Ran(A'' &minus; λ '''I'), By inductive hypothesis, there exists a basis  such that ''A' '', expressed in terms of this basis, is in Jordan normal form.Next consider the subspace Ker(A'' &minus; λ '''I'). If\mathrm(A - \lambda I) \cap \mathrm(A - \lambda I) = \,the desired result follows immediately from the rank–nullity theorem. This would be the case, for example, if A was Hermitian.Otherwise, ifQ = \mathrm(A - \lambda I) \cap \mathrm(A - \lambda I) \neq \,let the dimension of Q'' be ''s ≤ r''. Each vector in ''Q is an eigenvector of A' '' corresponding to eigenvalue ''λ. So the Jordan form of A' '' must contain ''s Jordan chains corresponding to s'' linearly independent eigenvectors. So the basis  must contain s'' vectors, say , that are lead vectors in these Jordan chains from the Jordan normal form of A'. We can "extend the chains" by taking the preimages of these lead vectors. (This is the key step of argument; in general, generalized eigenvectors need not lie in Ran(A'' &minus; λ '''I').) Let q''''i be such that\; (A - \lambda I) q_i = p_i \mbox i = r-s+1, \ldots, r.Clearly q''''i does not lie in Ker(A'' &minus; λ I) for all ''i. Furthermore, q''''i cannot be in Ran(A'' &minus; λ '''I'), for that would contradict the assumption that each pi is a lead vector in a Jordan chain. The set , being preimages of the linearly independent set  under A'' &minus; λ '''I', is also linearly independent.Finally, we can pick any linearly independent set  that spans\; \mathrm(A - \lambda I) - Q.By construction, the union the three sets , , and  is linearly independent. Each vector in the union is either an eigenvector or a generalized eigenvector of ''A. Finally, by rank–nullity theorem, the cardinality of the union is n''. In other words, we have found a basis that consists of eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors of ''A, and this shows A can be put in Jordan normal form.UniquenessIt can be shown that the Jordan normal form of a given matrix A is unique up to the order of the Jordan blocks.Knowing the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues is not sufficient to determine the Jordan normal form of A''. Assuming the algebraic multiplicity ''m(λ) of an eigenvalue λ is known, the structure of the Jordan form can be ascertained by analysing the ranks of the powers (A'' &minus; λ)''m(λ). To see this, suppose an n'' &times; ''n matrix A'' has only one eigenvalue λ. So ''m(λ) = n''. The smallest integer ''k1 such that(A - \lambda)^ = 0is the size of the largest Jordan block in the Jordan form of A''. (This number ''k1 is also called the index of λ. See discussion in a following section.) The rank of(A - \lambda)^is the number of Jordan blocks of size k1. Similarly, the rank of(A - \lambda)^is twice the number of Jordan blocks of size k''1 plus the number of Jordan blocks of size ''k1 &minus; 1. Iterating in this way gives the precise Jordan structure of A. The general case is similar.This can be used to show the uniqueness of the Jordan form. Let J''1 and ''J2 be two Jordan normal forms of A''. Then ''J1 and J''2 are similar and have the same spectrum, including algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues. The procedure outlined in the previous paragraph can be used to determine the structure of these matrices. Since the rank of a matrix is preserved by similarity transformation, there is a bijection between the Jordan blocks of ''J1 and J2. This proves the uniqueness statement.ConsequencesOne can see that the Jordan normal form is essentially a classification result for square matrices, and as such several important results from linear algebra can be viewed as its consequences.Spectral mapping theoremUsing the Jordan normal form, direct calculation gives a spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus: Let A'' be an ''n &times; n'' matrix with eigenvalues λ1, ..., λ''n, then for any polynomial p'', ''p(A'') has eigenvalues ''p(λ1), ..., p''(λ''n).Cayley–Hamilton theoremThe Cayley–Hamilton theorem asserts that every matrix A'' satisfies its characteristic equation: if ''p is the characteristic polynomial of A'', then ''p(A) = 0. This again can be shown via direct calculation in the Jordan form.Minimal polynomialThe minimal polynomial of a square matrix A'' is the unique monic polynomial of least degree, ''m, such that m''(''A) = 0. Alternatively, the set of polynomials that annihilate a given A'' form an ideal ''I in C''[''x], the principal ideal domain of polynomials with complex coefficients. The element that generates I'' is precisely ''m.Let λ1, ..., λq'' be the distinct eigenvalues of ''A, and s''''i be the size of the largest Jordan block corresponding to λi''. It is clear from the Jordan normal form that the minimal polynomial of ''A has degree ∑''s''i.While the Jordan normal form determines the minimal polynomial, the converse is not true. This leads to the notion of elementary divisors. The elementary divisors of a square matrix A'' are the characteristic polynomials of its Jordan blocks. The factors of the minimal polynomial ''m are the elementary divisors of the largest degree corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.The degree of an elementary divisor is the size of the corresponding Jordan block, therefore the dimension of the corresponding invariant subspace. If all elementary divisors are linear, A is diagonalizable.Invariant subspace decompositionsThe Jordan form of a n'' &times; ''n matrix A'' is block diagonal, therefore gives a decomposition of the ''n dimensional Euclidean space into invariant subspaces of A''. Every Jordan block ''Ji'' corresponds to an invariant subspace ''Xi. Symbolically, we put\mathbb^n = \bigoplus_^k X_iwhere each X''''i is the span of the corresponding Jordan chain, and k is the number of Jordan chains.One can also obtain a slightly different decomposition via the Jordan form. Given an eigenvalue λi'', the size of its largest corresponding Jordan block ''si is called the index of λi'' and denoted by ν(λ''i). (Therefore the degree of the minimal polynomial is the sum of all indices.) Define a subspace Y''''i by\; Y_i = \operatorname (\lambda_i - A)^.This gives the decomposition\mathbb^n = \bigoplus_^l Y_iwhere l'' is the number of distinct eigenvalues of ''A. Intuitively, we glob together the Jordan block invariant subspaces corresponding to the same eigenvalue. In the extreme case where A'' is a multiple of the identity matrix we have ''k = n'' and ''l = 1.Comparing the two decompositions, notice that, in general, l'' ≤ ''k. When A'' is normal, the subspaces ''Xi's in the first decomposition are one-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. This is the spectral theorem for normal operators. The second decomposition generalizes more easily for general compact operators on Banach spaces.It might be of interest here to note some properties of the index, ν(λ). More generally, for a complex number λ, its index can be defined as the least non-negative integer ν(λ) such that\mathrm(\lambda - A)^ = \operatorname (\lambda - A)^m, \; \forall m \geq \nu(\lambda) .So ν(λ) &gt; 0 if and only if λ is an eigenvalue of A. In the finite dimensional case, ν(λ) ≤ the algebraic multiplicity of λ.GeneralizationsMatrices with entries in a fieldJordan reduction can be extended to any square matrix M'' whose entries lie in a field ''K. The result states that any M'' can be written as a sum ''D + N'' where ''D is semisimple, N'' is nilpotent, and ''DN = ND. This is called the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition. Whenever K'' contains the eigenvalues of ''M, in particular when K is algebraically closed, the normal form can be expressed explicitly as the direct sum of Jordan blocks.Similar to the case when K'' is the complex numbers, knowing the dimensions of the kernels of (''M &minus; λ''I'')k'' for 1 ≤ ''k ≤ m'', where ''m is the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ, allows one to determine the Jordan form of M''. We may view the underlying vector space ''V as a K''[''x]-module by regarding the action of x'' on ''V as application of M'' and extending by ''K-linearity. Then the polynomials (x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;λ)''k are the elementary divisors of M'', and the Jordan normal form is concerned with representing ''M in terms of blocks associated to the elementary divisors.The proof of the Jordan normal form is usually carried out as an application to the ring K''[''x] of the structure theorem for finitely-generated modules over principal ideal domains, of which it is a corollary.Compact operatorsIn a different direction, for compact operators on a Banach space, a result analogous to the Jordan normal form holds. One restricts to compact operators because every point x'' in the spectrum of a compact operator ''T, the only exception being when x is the limit point of the spectrum, is an eigenvalue. This is not true for bounded operators in general. To give some idea of this generalization, we first reformulate the Jordan decomposition in the language of functional analysis.Holomorphic functional calculus Let X'' be a Banach space, ''L(X'') be the bounded operators on ''X, and σ(T'') denote the spectrum of ''T ∈ L''(''X). The holomorphic functional calculus is defined as follows:Fix a bounded operator T''. Consider the family Hol(''T) of complex functions that is holomorphic on some open set G'' containing σ(''T). Let Γ =  be a finite collection of Jordan curves such that σ(''T) lies in the inside of Γ, we define f''(''T) byf(T) = \frac \int_ f(z)(z - T)^ dz.The open set G'' could vary with ''f and need not be connected. The integral is defined as the limit of the Riemann sums, as in the scalar case. Although the integral makes sense for continuous f'', we restrict to holomorphic functions to apply the machinery from classical function theory (e.g. the Cauchy integral formula). The assumption that σ(''T) lie in the inside of Γ ensures f''(''T) is well defined; it does not depend on the choice of Γ. The functional calculus is the mapping Φ from Hol(T'') to ''L(X) given by\; \Phi(f) = f(T).We will require the following properties of this functional calculus:Φ extends the polynomial functional calculus.The spectral mapping theorem holds: σ(f''(''T)) = f''(σ(''T)).Φ is an algebra homomorphism.The finite dimensional caseIn the finite dimensional case, σ(T'') =  is a finite discrete set in the complex plane. Let e''''i be the function that is 1 in some open neighborhood of λi and 0 elsewhere. By property 3 of the functional calculus, the operator\; e_i(T)is a projection. Moreoever, let νi'' be the index of λ''i andf(z)= (z - \lambda_i)^.The spectral mapping theorem tells us f(T) e_i (T) = (T - \lambda_i)^ e_i (T)has spectrum . By property 1, f''(''T) can be directly computed in the Jordan form, and by inspection, we see that the operator f''(''T)ei(T) is the zero matrix.By property 3, f''(''T) e''''i(T'') = ''ei''(''T) f''(''T). So e''''i(T) is precisely the projection onto the subspace\mathrm \; e_i (T) = \mathrm(T - \lambda_i)^.The relation\; \sum_i e_i = 1implies\mathbb^n = \bigoplus_i \; \mathrm\; e_i (T) = \bigoplus_i \; \mathrm(T - \lambda_i)^where the index i'' runs through the distinct eigenvalues of ''T. This is exactly the invariant subspace decomposition\mathbb^n = \bigoplus_i Y_igiven in a previous section. Each ei(T'') is the projection onto the subspace spanned by the Jordan chains corresponding to λ''i.This explicit identification of the operators ei(T) in turn gives an explicit form of holomorphic functional calculus for matrices:For all f'' ∈ Hol(''T),f(T) = \sum_ \sum_^ \frac (T - \lambda_i)^k e_i (T).Notice that the expression of f''(''T) is a finite sum because, on each neighborhood of λi'', we have chosen the Taylor series expansion of ''f centered at λi.Poles of an operatorLet T'' be a bounded operator λ be an isolated point of σ(''T). (As stated above, when T is compact, every point in its spectrum is an isolated point, except possibly the limit point 0.)The point λ is called a pole of operator T'' with order ν if the resolvent function ''RT defined by\; R_T(\lambda) = (\lambda - T)^has a pole of order ν at λ.We will show that, in the finite dimensional case, the order of an eigenvalue coincides with its index. The result also holds for compact operators.Consider the annular region A'' centered at the eigenvalue λ with sufficiently small radius ε such that the intersection of the open disc ''Bε(λ) and σ(T'') is . The resolvent function ''RT'' is holomorphic on ''A. Extending a result from classical function theory, R''''T has a Laurent series representation on A:R_T(z) = \sum _ ^ a_m (\lambda - z)^mwherea_ = - \frac \int_C (\lambda - z) ^ (z - T)^ d z and C is a small circle centered at λ.By the previous discussion on the functional calculus,\; a_ = -(\lambda - T)^ e_ (T) where \; e_ is 1 on \; B_(\lambda) and 0 elsewhere.But we have shown that the smallest positive integer m such thata_ \neq 0 and a_ = 0 \; \; \forall \; l \geq mis precisely the index of λ, ν(λ). In other words, the function R''''T has a pole of order ν(λ) at λ.ExampleThis example shows how to calculate the Jordan normal form of a given matrix. As the next section explains, it is important to do the computation exactly instead of rounding the results.Consider the matrixA =\begin5 &amp;  4 &amp;  2 &amp;  1 \\
0 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\1 & -1 & 3 & 0 \\1 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp;  2\end which is mentioned in the beginning of the article.The characteristic polynomial of A is \chi(\lambda) = \det(\lambda I - A) = \lambda^4 - 11 \lambda^3 + 42 \lambda^2 - 64 \lambda + 32 = (\lambda-1)(\lambda-2)(\lambda-4)^2. \, This shows that the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 4 and 4, according to algebraic multiplicity. The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 can be found by solving the equation Av = v''. It is spanned by the column vector ''v = (&minus;1, 1, 0, 0)T. Similarly, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 2 is spanned by w'' = (1, &minus;1, 0, 1)T. Finally, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is also one-dimensional (even though this is a double eigenvalue) and is spanned by ''x = (1, 0, &minus;1, 1)T. So, the geometric multiplicity (i.e. dimension of the eigenspace of the given eigenvalue) of each of the three eigenvalues is one. Therefore, the two eigenvalues equal to 4 correspond to a single Jordan block, and the Jordan normal form of the matrix A is the direct sum J = J_1(1) \oplus J_1(2) \oplus J_2(4) =\begin 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end.  There are three chains. Two have length one:  and , corresponding to the eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively. There is one chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4. To find this chain, calculate\ker^2 = \operatorname \, \left\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end, \begin 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end \right\.Pick a vector in the above span that is not in the kernel of A''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4''I, e.g., y'' = (1,0,0,0)T. Now, (''A&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4''I'')y'' = ''x and (A''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4''I)x'' = 0, so  is a chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4.The transition matrix P'' such that ''P&minus;1AP = J is formed by putting these vectors next to each other as follows P = \Big[ \,v\, \Big| \,w\, \Big| \,x\, \Big| \,y\, \Big] =\begin1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\1 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 
0 &amp;  0 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 \\
0 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 &amp;  0\end.  A computation shows that the equation P''&minus;1''AP = J indeed holds.P^AP=J=\begin1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \end.If we had interchanged the order of which the chain vectors appeared, that is, changing the order of v'', ''w and  together, the Jordan blocks would be interchanged. However, the Jordan forms are equivalent Jordan forms.Numerical analysisIf the matrix A has multiple eigenvalues, or is close to a matrix with multiple eigenvalues, then its Jordan normal form is very sensitive to perturbations. Consider for instance the matrix A = \begin 1 & 1 \\ \varepsilon & 1 \end. If ε = 0, then the Jordan normal form is simply \begin 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end. However, for ε ≠ 0, the Jordan normal form is \begin 1+\sqrt\varepsilon & 0 \\ 0 & 1-\sqrt\varepsilon \end. This ill conditioning makes it very hard to develop a robust numerical algorithm for the Jordan normal form, as the result depends critically on whether two eigenvalues are deemed to be equal. For this reason, the Jordan normal form is usually avoided in numerical analysis; the stable Schur decomposition is often a better alternative.See Golub & Van Loan (1996), §7.6.5; or Golub & Wilkinson (1976) for details.PowersIf n'' is a natural number, the ''nth power of a matrix in Jordan normal form will be a direct sum of upper triangular matrices, as a result of block multiplication. More specifically, after exponentiation each Jordan block will be an upper triangular block.For example,\begin2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5\end^4 =\begin16 &amp; 32 &amp; 24 &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\
0  &amp; 16 &amp; 32 &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\
0  &amp; 0  &amp; 16 &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\ 
0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 625 &amp; 500 \\
0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0   &amp; 625\end.Further, each triangular block will consist of λn'' on the main diagonal, \tbinom times λ''n-1 on the upper diagonal, and so on.For example,\begin\lambda_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \lambda_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_2\end^n =\begin\lambda_1^n &amp; \tbinom\lambda_1^ &amp; \tbinom\lambda_1^ &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\
0  &amp; \lambda_1^n &amp; \tbinom\lambda_1^ &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\
0  &amp; 0  &amp; \lambda_1^n &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\ 
0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; \lambda_2^n &amp; \tbinom\lambda_2^ \\
0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0   &amp; \lambda_2^n\end.See alsoMatrix decompositionCanonical formJordan matrixNotesReferencesN. Dunford and J.T.
