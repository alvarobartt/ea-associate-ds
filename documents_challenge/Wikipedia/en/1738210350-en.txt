In his club career from 1985 to 2003, he played for nine different clubs, in four different leagues. He scored a total of 103 goals in Serie A, one of the best totals for a non-Italian in the league's history. In 1997-98 season, he led Serie A in goals with 27.Bierhoff, however, was never a success in the Bundesliga. After failing to shine in Germany, he got his chance in the Austrian Bundesliga. That gave him the chance at Ascoli Calcio in Italy. But it was at Udinese, under Alberto Zaccheroni, that Bierhoff found success and won his place in fame and in the German national team. He never returned to prove himself in his home country, like, for example, Jürgen Klinsmann did when he joined Bayern Munich in 1995.Bierhoff was known for his remarkable heading skill, and he was often regarded as one of the best headers in the game. It was said that Bierhoff's headers might be more powerful than his shot.Career statistics  |- |1986-87||rowspan="2"|Uerdingen||rowspan="2"|Bundesliga||19||3|||||||||||||||| |- |1987-88||12||1|||||||||||||||| |- |1988-89||rowspan="2"|Hamburger SV||rowspan="2"|Bundesliga||24||6|||||||||||||||| |- |1989-90||10||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1989-90||Borussia Mönchengladbach||Bundesliga||8||0||||||||||||||||  |- |1990-91||Austria Salzburg||Bundesliga||33||23||||||||||||||||  |- |1991-92||rowspan="4"|Ascoli||Serie A||17||2|||||||||||||||| |- |1992-93||rowspan="3"|Serie B||35||20|||||||||||||||| |- |1993-94||32||17|||||||||||||||| |- |1994-95||33||9|||||||||||||||| |- |1995-96||rowspan="3"|Udinese||rowspan="3"|Serie A||31||17|||||||||||||||| |- |1996-97||23||13|||||||||||||||| |- |1997-98||32||27|||||||||||||||| |- |1998-99||rowspan="4"|Milan||rowspan="4"|Serie A||34||20|||||||||||||||| |- |1999-00||30||11|||||||||||||||| |- |2000-01||27||6|||||||||||||||| |- |2001-02||0||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2001-02||Monaco||Division 1||18||4||||||||||||||||  |- |2002-03||ChievoVerona||Serie A||26||7|||||||||||||||| 73||10|||||||||||||||| 33||23|||||||||||||||| 320||149|||||||||||||||| 18||4|||||||||||||||| 444||186|||||||||||||||| |German national teamBierhoff made his debut for the German national team in a friendly against Portugal on February 21, 1996. In his second appearance on March 27, 1996, he managed to score his first two international goals in his country's 2-0 win over Denmark. Altogether Bierhoff scored 37 goals in 70 caps, including both goals in the 2-1 win over the Czech Republic in the Euro 1996 final after having come on as a substitute.In an important qualification match on August 20, 1997, Germany trailed Northern Ireland, 0-1, with 20 minutes left when the manager of the national team, Berti Vogts, decided to substitute Thomas Häßler and Oliver Bierhoff. Within seven minutes the former provided the latter with three assists, which Bierhoff turned into three beautiful goals, scoring the fastest hat-trick in the history of the German national team.Bierhoff also played in Euro 2000, and both the 1998 and 2002 World Cups. He made his last appearance for his country when he was brought on during the second half of the World Cup 2002 final against Brazil, but was unable to help the Germans score in the 0-2 loss.International goalsScores and results table.
