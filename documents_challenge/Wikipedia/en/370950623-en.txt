He is also an author and a former Secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan. He is a member of the Democratic Party.A 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Webb served as a Marine Corps infantry officer until 1972, and is a highly decorated Vietnam War combat veteran. During his four years with the Reagan administration, Webb served as the first Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, then as Secretary of the Navy.Webb won the Democratic nomination for the 2006 Virginia Senate race by defeating Harris Miller in the primary, then won the general election by defeating the Republican incumbent George Allen. Webb's thin margin in the general election (less than 0.5%) kept the outcome uncertain for nearly two days after polls closed on November 7, 2006, and provided the final seat that tilted the Senate to Democratic control.Jim is also an author of many books, stating that "I've written for a living all my life, so writing is as much a part of me as working out."In 2009, upon the planned retirement of John Warner, Webb will become Virginia's senior Senator.BiographyEarly life and educationWebb was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri to James Henry Webb and his wife Vera Lorraine Hodges. He grew up in a military family, descended from Scots Irish immigrants from Ulster (northern Ireland) who emigrated in the 18th century to the British North American colonies. Webb's 2004 book Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America details his family history, noting that his ancestors fought in every major American war.Webb's father, a career officer in the U.S. Air Force, flew B-17s and B-29s during World War II, dropped cargo during the Berlin Airlift, and was later involved in missile programs. He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery.Because of his father's military career, Webb grew up on the move, attending more than a dozen schools across the U.S. and in England. After graduating from high school in Bellevue, Nebraska, he attended the University of Southern California on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship from 1963–1964 (and was a member of Delta Chi). In 1964, Webb earned appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. At Annapolis, Webb was a member of the Brigade Honor Committee. He also won a varsity letter for boxing, at one point fighting a controversial match against Oliver North, which was won by Oliver North. He graduated in 1968, in the same class with North, Dennis C. Blair, Michael Mullen, and Michael Hagee.Personal lifeWebb has been married three times, has four grown children, a newborn with his current wife Hong Le, and is stepfather to Le's daughter from a previous marriage.His first marriage was to Barbara Samorajczyk, a member of the Anne Arundel County, Maryland Council. They have one daughter, Amy.His second marriage was to health-care lobbyist Jo Ann Krukar, who also assisted in his 2006 Senate campaign. They have three children: Sarah, Jimmy, and Julia. Jimmy is a rifleman and Lance Corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, and has recently returned from service in Iraq. His unit is based out of Camp Lejeune. In tribute to Jimmy and "all the people sent into harm's way", Webb wore his son's old combat boots every day during his 2006 Senate campaign.Webb is now married to Hong Le Webb, a Vietnamese-American securities and corporate lawyer. Hong Le was born in South Vietnam and escaped to the United States after the fall of Saigon. She grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. Hong Le and Webb have one child together, Georgia LeAnh, born 2006. Hong Le also has a daughter, Emily Nguyen, from a previous marriage. Webb speaks Vietnamese.Military serviceAfter graduating from Annapolis, Webb was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. As a first lieutenant during the Vietnam War he served as a platoon commander with Delta Company, 1st Battalion 5th Marines. He earned a Navy Cross, the second highest decoration in the Navy and Marine Corps for heroism in Vietnam. Webb also earned the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts.Webb received the Navy Cross for actions on July 10, 1969. The citation read:  In a November 19, 2006 appearance on Meet the Press, Webb told host Tim Russert, "And I, you know, I’m one of these people who — there, there aren’t many of us — who can still justify for you the reasons that we went into Vietnam, however screwed up the strategy got."Post-militaryWebb attended Georgetown Law Center from 1972 to 1975, graduating with a law degree. While at Georgetown, Webb wrote his first book, Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy.From 1977 to 1981, Webb worked on the staff of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. During this time, he also represented veterans pro-bono. Webb also taught at the Naval Academy and was criticized for a 1979 article published in the Washingtonian titled "Women Can't Fight"  (see "Senate Election" below).During the Reagan Administration, Webb served as the nation's first Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs from 1984 to 1987. During his time as Assistant Secretary, Webb sought to reorganize the Marine Corps. He was gravely concerned with the disarray the Marines had fallen into post-Vietnam: drug use, racial infighting, and low morale within the Corps left him with the impression it was no longer America's premier fighting force. The Marine Corps was also rocked by two scandals during this time: the Clayton Lonetree espionage affair, where Lonetree became the first Marine convicted of espionage, and Marine Lt. Colonel Oliver North's central role in the Iran-Contra affair.In 1987, he served as Secretary of the Navy, becoming the first Naval Academy graduate to serve as the civilian head of the Navy. As Navy Secretary, Webb pushed the appointment of Alfred M. Gray, Jr. as Commandant of the Marine Corps, hoping that Gray could reshape the Corps into the elite unit it once was. Webb resigned in 1988 after refusing to agree to reduce the size of the Navy. Webb had wished to increase the Navy to 600 ships. As revealed in The Reagan Diaries, President Ronald Reagan wrote on February 22, 1988: "I don't think Navy was sorry to see him go." .After his resignation, Webb earned his living primarily as an author and filmmaker. He won an Emmy Award for his 1983 PBS coverage of the U.S. Marines in Beirut.Among Webb's awards for community service and professional excellence are the Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Medal, the Medal of Honor Society's Patriot Award, the American Legion National Commander's Public Service Award, the Veterans of Foreign Wars Media Service Award, the Marine Corps League's Military Order of the Iron Mike Award, the John H. Russell Leadership Award, and the Robert L. Denig Distinguished Service AwardOn March 30, 2003, Webb wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times comparing the resistance American troops were facing in the Iraq War to the guerrilla fighting he had seen in Vietnam, and saying, "it is hard to imagine an end point without an extremely difficult period of occupation."During the 2004 presidential campaign, Webb wrote an op-ed piece for USA Today in which he, as a military veteran, evaluated the candidacies of John Kerry and George W. Bush. He criticized Kerry for the nature of his opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1970s while affiliated with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and accused Bush of using his father's connections to avoid service in Vietnam. Webb also wrote that Bush had "committed the greatest strategic blunder in modern memory" with the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Webb endorsed incumbent Democrat Charles Robb for reelection to his Senate seat, over Webb's former Naval Academy classmate and fellow Marine Oliver North, in 1994."Six Veterans Bash North, Push Robb for Senate" Kent Jenkins Jr.. The Washington Post Washington, D.C.: Oct 8, 1994. pg. b.01 Webb subsequently endorsed Republican George Allen over Robb in 2000,"Can the Democrats Handle a Heretic?" Joe Klein. Time. New York: Jun 12, 2006. Vol. 167, Iss. 24; pg. 25 and then ran against Allen himself in 2006.United States Senate2006 Senate campaignIn late 2005, a campaign to draft Webb to run for the Senate in 2006 began on the Internet. On February 7, 2006, he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the 2006 Senate race against incumbent Virginia Senator George Allen.In the Democratic primary on June 13, 2006, Webb faced longtime businessman and lobbyist Harris Miller. Webb won with 53.5% of the vote, in a race with low turnout.Webb benefited from the fallout from an August 11, 2006 incident in which Allen used the word macaca to refer to S.R. Sidarth, who was filming an event as a "tracker" for the Webb campaign. A poll the following week showed Webb gaining 10 percentage points. The race, which at one point looked like a sure win for Allen, became one of the most watched and closest races of the 2006 elections.Allen had been expected to be reelected relatively easily, and that this reelection would prepare him for a possible 2008 Presidential candidacy. But Webb's entry into the race and primary victory changed the political landscape. Political analyst Larry Sabato said in May that "Jim Webb is George Allen's worst nightmare: a war hero and a Reagan appointee who holds moderate positions… Allen tries to project a Reagan aura, but Webb already has it." In September, Bloomberg.com's Catherine Dodge wrote an article highlighting Webb and the Senate race, and said "Webb isn't a typical Democrat. His family hails from the rural southern part of the state. He's pro-gun ownership, and he takes a harder line on illegal immigration than many Senate Republicans."On September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement which included footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan praising Webb's service as a Marine.  The next day, the Chief of Staff for the Reagan Library wrote Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement saying it was neither fair nor respectful because it gave the impression of an endorsement. The Webb campaign disagreed, saying, "What Reagan said about Jim Webb, that belongs to Jim Webb, frankly." The library said they ask all candidates to refrain from using the former president's image but declined to say if they would request the Allen campaign to remove the image of Reagan used on his campaign website.Five female graduates of the United States Naval Academy held a press conference, decrying a 1979 article by Webb, titled "Women Can't Fight." The women said Webb's article contributed to an atmosphere of hostility and harassment towards women at the academy. Webb was later endorsed by nine military women who stated that Webb is a "man of integrity" who "recognizes the crucial role that women have in the military today." In October 2006, the Allen campaign issued a press release quoting several passages from Webb's novels with sexual content, including graphic references to female anatomy and purported pedophilia, homosexuality and incest, citing a passage in which a Southeast Asian father ritually places the penis of his young son in his mouth. The press release said that the passages showed a "continued pattern of demeaning women". Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, WTOP-FM, whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.On November 9, 2006, after AP and Reuters projected that Webb had won the seat, Allen conceded the election. Although the margin was narrow — less than half of 1% of the total vote and therefore small enough under Virginia law to allow demanding a recount — Allen stated that he would not challenge the result.Webb, as a Democratic veteran challenger, was also considered one of the Fighting Dems.Senator-electOn November 15, 2006, Senate majority leader in waiting Harry Reid assigned Webb to three committees: the committees on Foreign Relations, Veterans' Affairs, and Armed Services.That same day, an op ed authored by Webb appeared in the pages of the Wall Street Journal. Titled "Class Struggle," the piece addressed what Webb feels is a growing economic inequality in the United States, touching on what he feels are overly permissive immigration policies, extravagant executive compensation, the detrimental effects of free trade and globalization, iniquitous tax cuts, and speedily rising health care costs, and attacking the "elites" who he says perpetuate the aforementioned woes for their personal economic gain. Tense exchange with President BushOn November 28, 2006, at a White House reception for those newly elected to Congress, Webb declined to stand in the line to have his picture taken with the president, whom Webb often criticized during the campaign. According to Congressman Jim Moran of Virginia, aides warned the President to be "extra sensitive about talking to Webb about his son, since Webb's son had had a recent brush with death in Iraq." The president approached Webb later and asked him, "How's your boy?", referring to Webb's son, a Marine serving in Iraq. Webb replied "I'd like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President." Bush responded, "That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?" Webb responded, "That's between me and my boy, Mr. President." The Hill cited an anonymous source who claimed that Webb was so angered by the exchange that he confessed he was tempted to "slug" the president (The senator did no such thing). Webb later remarked in an interview, "I'm not particularly interested in having a picture of me and George W. Bush on my wall."In response to the incident, some conservatives criticized Webb, including George Will, who called Webb a "boor" and wrote, "Webb already has become what Washington did not need another of, a subtraction from the city's civility and clear speaking." Others, such as conservative columnist and former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan, reserved their criticism for Bush, writing: "I thought it had the sound of the rattling little aggressions of our day, but not on Mr. Webb's side."[[Image:Jim Webb with son Jimmy and George W. Bush 2008.jpg‎|thumb|right      |Jim Webb with son Jimmy and George W. Bush in March, 2008‎]]Webb was asked about the exchange in a January 4, 2007 appearance on Hardball with Chris Matthews. He told Matthews:"My feeling about that — first of all, it's been kind of a bit overblown. But I think when people are now seeing how John McCain is handling the situation with his son being in the Marine Corps, perhaps they can understand a little bit more what I was having to go through during the entire campaign. I greatly respect my son‘s service and all of the people who are serving. At the same time, I have not commented, even to many of my friends, about the operational side. That‘s personal to me in terms of my feelings about it. And it was not a casual comment. As I said in the piece that you just ran, I think the best article that was written on that was by Peggy Noonan in the Wall Street Journal when she basically said that the lack of civility was not mine and I feel that way."After his son returned from Iraq, Webb "buried the hatchet" with the president by setting up a private chat with his son, the president, and himself in the Oval Office. 110th United States SenateOn January 4, 2007, Webb was sworn into the 110th U.S. Senate, accompanied by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a fellow former Secretary of the Navy; and former Virginia Democratic Sen. Charles Robb.Webb’s first legislative act was to introduce a bill, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act, to expand benefits for military families. The act replaces key provisions of the Montgomery G.I. Bill for recent veterans and “makes veterans benefits identical to those soldiers received following World War II.” “With many of our military members serving two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is past time to enact a new veterans’ education program modeled on the World War II era G.I. bill. This is exactly what our legislation does.” Webb said. It became law on June 30, 2008, as part of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008.In a January 4, 2007, appearance on The Situation Room, Webb articulated his position on the Iraq War: "What we really need to do is to get into the arena where we can talk about a strategy, talk about the pluses and the minuses of the Baker-Hamilton Commission and work toward a solution that, on the one hand, will allow us to remove our combat troops, but on the other, will increase the stability of the region, allow us to continue to fight against international terrorism and allow us, as a nation, to address our strategic interests around the world. And this is — this is one of the drawbacks that we've had with so many troops having been put into this constant rotational basis inside one country when we have a war against international terrorism that's global."Asked by Wolf Blitzer if he would ever support the efforts of Dennis Kucinich to cut funding for the war, Webb said, "I — you know, I lived through Vietnam. I lived through it as a Marine and I know that those sorts of approaches, while they seem attractive on one level are really not that realistic. What we want to do — and I was talking with a number of senators today — is to try to get some of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play."On January 23, 2007, Webb delivered the Democratic response to the President's State of the Union address, focusing on the economy and Iraq. Webb's speech drew positive reviews, and was regarded as one of the stronger State of the Union responses in recent memory.  Webb, a decorated war veteran spoke of his family’s military past, his own passionate attachment to the military, and the way in which previous presidents had always attempted to ensure that all precautions had been taken when sending young Americans into harm's way.On March 5, 2007, Webb introduced his second piece of legislation, , intended to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran without the prior approval of Congress. In a statement on the floor of the Senate, Webb said, "The major function of this legislation is to prevent this Administration from commencing unprovoked military activities against Iran without the approval of the Congress. The legislation accomplishes this goal through the proper constitutional process of prohibiting all funding for such an endeavor."On March 26, 2007, a senatorial aide of Webb, Phillip Thompson, was arrested for carrying Webb's loaded pistol as he entered the Russell Senate Office Building and for carrying unregistered ammunition. The weapon was discovered when Thompson went through an X-ray machine with a briefcase that contained a loaded pistol and two additional loaded magazines.  Charges against the aide were dismissed after prosecutors concluded it could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Thompson was aware that the gun and ammunition were in the briefcase.  The incident, which some saw as embarrassing to the freshman senator, nonetheless reinforced Webb's image as a non-traditional Democrat who strays from party orthodoxy on the issue of gun control. The senator responded to his aide's arrest by reiterating his support for gun-owners' rights:  "I’m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment; I have had a permit to carry a weapon in Virginia for a long time; I believe that it’s important; it’s important to me personally and to a lot of people in the situation that I’m in to be able to defend myself and my family."Gun arrest gives Webb political opening - Tom Curry - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; On December 26, 2007, Webb called the Senate to order for 11 seconds. He was present in the chamber for 57 seconds. This brief stint of activity was in order to prevent President Bush from making a recess appointment of Steven Bradbury to the Office of Legal Counsel at the United States Justice Department.Webb was assigned to the following U.S. Senate committees and subcommittees: the Committee on Foreign Relations (including the Subcommittee on African Affairs, the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, the Subcommittee on International Operations and Organizations, Democracy and Human Rights, and the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps and Narcotics Affairs), the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Committee on Armed Services (including the Subcommittee on Airland, the Subcommittee on Personnel, and the Subcommittee on SeaPower), and the Joint Economic Committee.Webb played a major role in crafting and securing passage of legislation to increase education benefits for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.2008 Vice presidential speculationWebb was frequently mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential Democratic nominee for Barack Obama in 2008 due to his military experience and moderate policy positions. Although he said he was not interested in the vice presidency, speculations about him being picked by Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time, were still heard. On July, 7, Webb effectively removed himself as a possible candidate for Vice President in a statement made to Time Magazine, stating that he intended to serve his term in the Senate and that "under no circumstances will I be a candidate for Vice President.” Obama went on to choose fellow senator Joe Biden as his running mateAs an authorBooksWebb's successful first novel, Fields of Fire (1978), drawn from personal experience, tells the story of a platoon of US Marines in late 1960s Vietnam. Reviewers hailed its pull-no-punches descriptions of infantry life and combat.After five more novels, he wrote a work of nonfiction, Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America, tracing the role people of Scots-Irish ancestry have played in American history and culture. Webb argues that, contrary to the "cracker" and "redneck" stereotypes often applied to the Scots-Irish, many of whom settled in Appalachia, the American Midwest and the American South, the Scots-Irish were central to defining American working class values and culture. He lauds the fiercely independent streak and individualism of the Scots-Irish, and explains how their political pragmatism has often led them to play the role of swing voters in elections, for example as Reagan Democrats, and as voters for Ross Perot and Reform Party.Fields of Fire (1978) ISBN 0-553-58385-9A Sense of Honor (1981) ISBN 1-55750-917-4A Country Such as This (1983) ISBN 1-55750-964-6Something to Die For (1992) ISBN 0-380-71322-5The Emperor's General (1999) ISBN 0-553-57854-5Lost Soldiers (2002) ISBN 0-440-24091-3Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America (2004) ISBN 0-7679-1688-3A Time to Fight: Reclaiming a Fair and Just America (2008) ISBN 0-7679-2835-0MoviesWebb wrote the story and was the executive producer for the 2000 movie Rules of Engagement, which starred Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.Warner Brothers acquired Webb's script for Whiskey River. Currently in production, the movie is directed and produced by Rob Reiner. The film concerns an American soldier who is injured in Iraq and returns to the United States. Before completing rehabilitation, he is called back to active duty. His father, in an attempt to save his son's life, kidnaps him.In October 2006, while commenting on the need to break away from stereotypical movie villains, Webb stated, "every movie needs a villain. Towel-heads and rednecks—of which I am one... became the easy villains in so many movies out there."ArticlesWebb has authored a number of articles in various journals and newspapers, including the Marine Corps Gazette, Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute, USA Today, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal.On November 15, 2006, The Wall Street Journal published an article by Webb entitled &quot;Class Struggle.&quot; Webb argued that the government must "confront the growing unfairness in this age of globalization." He also stated that the "elites" ignore the average American, and that they believe that "certain immigrant groups have the 'right genetics' and thus are natural entrants to the 'overclass,' while others, as well as those who come from stock that has been here for 200 years and have not made it to the top, simply don't possess the necessary attributes." Conservative columnist Jim Glassman has insinuated that this comment was anti-Semitic.
