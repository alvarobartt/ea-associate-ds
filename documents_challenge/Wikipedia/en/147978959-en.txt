 Osterode () is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southwest and clockwise) the districts of Göttingen, Northeim and Goslar, and by the state of Thuringia (districts of Nordhausen and Eichsfeld).HistoryThis part of the Harz mountains was ruled by the Welfen dynasty from the 12th century on. Osterode was the centre of the Principality of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, one of many small states within Brunswick-Lüneburg. Later this principality became part of Hanover, which in turn fell to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. In 1885 the Prussian administration established districts, among them Osterode.GeographyMore than two thirds of the district's area are occupied by the southwestern part of the Harz mountains, including the southern portion of the Harz National Park.Coat of armsTowns and municipalitiesTownsSamtgemeinden1seat of the SamtgemeindeExternal linksOfficial website (German)Local history Category:Districts of Lower Saxonyde:Landkreis Osterode am Harz es:Distrito de Osterode am Harz eo:Distrikto Osterode fr:Arrondissement d'Osterode am Harz id:Osterode (distrik) nl:Osterode am Harz (district) pl:Powiat Osterode am Harz pt:Osterode (distrito) ro:Osterode am Harz (district) ru:Остероде (район) sv:Landkreis Osterode am Harz zh:奥斯特罗德县
