 He has also raced with great success for Audi in the American Le Mans Series, winning the title with Dindo Capello in 2006 and 2007.Formula Oneengine fails at the 2002 French Grand Prix.]] McNish finally found an opening into Formula One in 2001, when the newly formed Toyota F1 team required a development driver. Given his link with Toyota through sportscars he was an obvious choice for this role, and impressed in testing to the extent that McNish was on the starting grid for the team's F1 race debut on March 3, 2002. Unfortunately, he did not score any points during the season's 17 races, and he and team-mate Mika Salo were replaced with a new line-up of Olivier Panis and Cristiano da Matta for 2003. Salo had scored points for the team on their debut in Melbourne and McNish had very nearly done the same with a superb drive in the Malaysian Grand Prix, only for a pit lane mistake by the team to cost him the result. Both drivers were told of their replacement before Da Matta was announced, and ITV's Martin Brundle commented that "replacing Salo and McNish with Panis and A.N. Other" was not, in his view, a step forward. As it was, the most notable moment of McNish's sole season in Formula One was his dramatic accident at the 130R corner while practising for the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, in which he escaped serious injury. This led to the corner being reprofiled the following year.After Formula Oneat the 2008 1000km of Silverstone]]In 2003 he was a test driver for Renault F1, also doing a little TV work for ITV, but the next year he returned to his successful sports car racing career, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring, combining this in 2005 with a venture into the highly competitive DTM (German Touring Car Championship), where he competes against the likes of former F1 men Mika Häkkinen and Jean Alesi. He also won Sportscar Driver of the Year awards from the Autosport and Le Mans magazines and the (Jackie) Stewart Medal Award for services to Scottish Motor Sport. He was made the President of the Scottish Motor Racing Club at their annual Prize Giving and Dinner in 2007, succeeding Sir Jackie Stewart.In 2006, he continues to race as an official Audi sports car driver and was part of the driving line up which won the 12 Hours of Sebring in the new Audi R10, having set the pole position time and broken the lap record. In 2008, McNish won the 24 Hours of Le Mans with the Audi alongside Tom Kristensen and Rinaldo Capello It was his first win at the Circuit de la Sarthe since .Other formulaeAs well as those above, McNish has also raced in the following racing series:KartingFormula FordVauxhall LotusBritish Formula 3North American GTFIA GTComplete Formula One results(key)YearTeam1234567891011121314151617TeamWDCPoints2002]]Toyota]]AUSRetMAL7BRARetSMRRetESP8AUT9MONRetCANRetEUR14GBRRetFRA11GERRetHUN14BEL9ITARetUSA15JPNDNSToyota]]19th02003]]Renault]]AUSTDMALTDBRATDSMRTDESPTDAUTTDMONTDCANTDEURTDFRA]]GBRTDGERTDHUNTDITATDUSATDJPNTDRenault]]--        ReferencesExternal linksAllan McNish's official websiteAllan McNish's official blogProfile - by FIA GT Championship official website Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish Formula One drivers Category:Scottish racecar drivers Category:British Formula Three Championship drivers Category:DTM drivers Category:FIA GT Championship drivers Category:24 Hours of Le Mans drivers Category:People from Dumfries Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:American Le Mans Series driversca:Allan McNish de:Allan McNish es:Allan McNish fr:Allan McNish id:Allan McNish it:Allan McNish lv:Alans Maknišs hu:Allan McNish nl:Allan McNish ja:アラン・マクニッシュ pl:Allan McNish pt:Allan McNish ro:Allan McNish ru:Макниш, Алан sl:Allan McNish fi:Allan McNish sv:Allan McNish
