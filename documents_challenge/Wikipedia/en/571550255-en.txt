Retrieved on 2008-01-18 Russians suffered significant defeat, however victorious Lithuania did not fully avail its victory.The town was damaged during the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667), which was a disaster for Lithuania. During the First Polish partition the city was taken over by the Russian Empire in 1772, and became part of the Mogilyov Gubernia. Under Russian rule, it was stripped of its Magdeburg Rights in 1776 and went into cultural and economic decline. The population dropped sharply to just about 2,000 inhabitants. The city symbol in 1781 was changed to one which included the symbol of the Russian empire and five arrows.In 1812, the city was badly burned during Napoleon's invasion. During the First World War, the city was occupied by German forces in February–October 1918. From February 2, 1919, Orsha became a part of Homyel region (Vitebsk region, 1920) of Soviet Russia. After the formation of the Soviet Union, it was transferred to the Byelorussian SSR in 1924.The population before World War II was about 37,000. The city was occupied by Germany on July 16, 1941. The occupiers founded several concentration camps in the city, where an estimated 19,000 people were killed.The legendary Katyusha multiple rocket launcher was used here for the first time by Soviet forces on July 14, 1941.The Soviets encouraged and co-ordinated undercover anti-fascist resistance groups, and one of the most famous was a partisan brigade under the command of Kanstantsin Zaslonau (Konstantin Zaslonov), operating from the Orsha train depot. His group planted ninety-three bombs on German trains in just three months. After March 1942, he went in hiding in the forests, where he and his group continued guerilla warfare. He was killed on November 14, 1942.Soviet troops liberated Orsha on June 27, 1944.Population change16th-17th century: est. 5,0001776 (after Russian occupation): less than 2,0001939: 37,0001970: 100,0002004: 125,000TransportationOrsha became an important transportation center after the construction of a Dnieper River port.

Before 1987 there were less than 100 new cancer patients registered each year. Since then the number grew five-fold, with more than 500 new patients registered per year as of 2004. The biggest growth was registered in 2003–04 (178%). This was widely reported in independent media, but Belarusian officials are silent about the alarming health situation and possible reasons for this high cancer rate.
