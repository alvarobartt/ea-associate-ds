surrounds its capital, Nyeri, and includes slopes of Mount Kenya (click to enlarge map).]] Kenya's Central Province covers the area around Nyeri to southwest of Mt. Kenya (see maps). It is the ancestral home of, among others, the g.e.m.a communities . According to the 1999 Census the province had a total population of 3,724,159 inhabitants for an area of 13,191&nbsp;km².ClimateThe climate of Central Province is generally cooler than that of the rest of Kenya due to the region's relatively higher altitude. Rainfall is fairly reliable, falling in two seasons, one from early March to May and a second during October and November.General informationCentral Province is a key producer of coffee, one of Kenya's key exports. Much of Kenya's dairy industry is also based in this province. The province's headquarters are in Nyeri. Central Province was divided into seven districts (''wilaya'at'') until 2007 Ministry of State for Provincial Administration and National Security:DistrictPopulationCapitalNyandarua]]&nbsp;&nbsp;479,902Ol Kalou*Nyeri]]661,156NyeriKirinyaga]]457,105KerugoyaMaragua]]387,969MaraguaMurang'a]]348,304Murang'aThika]]645,713ThikaKiambu]]744,010KiambuDistricts after 2007Several new district were created in 2007 in Kenya, including four in Central Province.DistrictCapitalGatundu]]Ol KalouKiambu East]]KiambuKiambu West]]LimuruKirinyaga]]KerugoyaMaragua]]MaraguaMurang'a North]]Murang'aMurang'a South]]Kenol Trading CentreNyandarua North]]NyahururuNyandarua South]]Engineer Trading CentreNyeri North]]ChakaNyeri South]]NyeriThika]]ThikaHistoryThe majority of the communities that now inhabit Central Province are of Eastern Bantu heritage and are believed to have migrated into the region in the 17th century. These communities chiefly consist of the Agikuyu, Aembu and Meru.During Kenya's colonisation by the British, much of the province was regarded as part of the 'White Highlands' for the exclusive use of the settler community. Thus it was prone to a lot of political activity from the local communities who felt that they had an ancestral right to the land. This culminated in the 1950s with the Mau Mau rebellion that saw the region placed under a state of emergency and the arrest of many prominent political leaders.See alsoRuiruReferences Category:Central Province (Kenya) Category:Provinces of Kenya ar:المحافظة الوسطى (كينيا) bg:Централна провинция (Кения) ca:Província Central (Kenya) de:Central (Kenia) es:Provincia Central (Kenia) fr:Province centrale (province du Kenya) ki:Gatagati mkoa, Kenya it:Provincia centrale (Kenya) sw:Mkoa wa Kati (Kenya) hu:Középső Tartomány (Kenya) nl:Kati (Kenia) ja:中央州 (ケニア) pl:Prowincja Centralna (Kenia) pt:Central (Quénia) sv:Centralprovinsen (Kenya) zh:中部省 (肯尼亚)
