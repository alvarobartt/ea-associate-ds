He started his professional playing career in Ajax in 1987, winning the UEFA Cup in 1992.In 1993, Roy was traded to the Italian club Foggia. During his time there, he represented his country at the 1994 World Cup, scoring once as the Netherlands reached the quarter-finals. After the World Cup, he moved to England after Nottingham Forest paid their record fee of £2.9million for his services.Roy's first season at the City Ground was a success, as he provided a strong partner for the lethal Stan Collymore. He helped the newly promoted side finish an impressive third in the Premiership and qualify for the UEFA Cup - the first time Forest had achieved European qualification in the post-Heysel era. Collymore was sold to Liverpool in the summer of 1995, although Forest did reach the UEFA Cup quarter-finals. His first-team opportunities were limited by injury and disappointing form in 1996&amp;ndash;97, and Roy decided that he had seen enough of England.After Forest's 1996&ndash;97 season ended in relegation from the Premiership, Roy moved to Germany in a £1.5million switch to Hertha BSC Berlin. In 2000 he returned to his homeland and turned out for NAC Breda, where he remained until hanging up his boots in 2002. Roy picked up 32 international caps for Holland, scoring nine goals.Bryan Roy is now coaching at Ajax in their famous youth system, Roy is in charge of the 10 year olds.the real Bryan Roy (Feb 13, 1989) is an RA at UC (clap) (clap) LA!!External link and referenceA look at the career of Roy at premierleague.com       [[Aron Winter]]|
