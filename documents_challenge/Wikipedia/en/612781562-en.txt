The municipality of Almere comprises the districts Almere Stad, Almere Haven, Almere Buiten, Almere Hout, Almere Poort (under construction) and Almere Pampus (design phase).Almere is one of the youngest cities in the Netherlands: the first house was finished in 1976, and Almere became a municipality in 1984.

Retrieved on 2008-06-09..HistoryThe original plans for the IJsselmeerpolders saw the land being used for agriculture. After World War II however ideas about housing for the rapidly growing population of Amsterdam were launched. Two towns in the polders Oostelijk Flevoland and Zuidelijk Flevoland were therefore designed. The town in Oostelijk Flevoland became Lelystad, the town in Zuidelijk Flevoland was still called Zuidweststad on the first sketches, but in the 1970s it became called Almere, named after the early medieval name of the Zuiderzee. The first house in Almere was finished in 1976. The town was then still controlled by the Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders (Z.IJ.P.), with a Landdrost. In 1984 Almere became an official municipality. Originally, Almere was envisioned as a town with more centres. This idea was later abandoned in favor of allowing neighbourhoods like Tussen de Vaarten to be built. There is also a difference between the way houses are built in the oldest and the newest parts of the city. The housing plan in Almere in the 1970s was basic functionality and a levelling of social status. However in the 1990s it became the trend to build more exclusive homes with striking designs (e.g. in the Regenboogbuurt).GovernanceLocal executiveFormer minister Annemarie Jorritsma-Lebbink (VVD) has been the mayor since 16 August 2003.
