This song was adopted as the national anthem on May 11, 1813, three years after the May Revolution (Revolución de Mayo). May 11 is therefore Anthem Day in Argentina.On May 24 1812, Vicente López attended a play presented at the Casa de la Comedia, Buenos Aires, titled El 25 de Mayo, which retold the story of the May Revolution that happened two years earlier. The play, written by Luis Ambrosio Morante, concluded with an anthem sung by the actors. López felt inspired and that same night wrote the first verses of an anthem that would replace Morante's, for which Blas Parera had composed the music.The General Constituent Assembly, the autonomous government of the time, approved the new anthem as Marcha Patriótica (Patriotic March) on May 11 1813, and commanded Parera to compose a new music. Some authors say that Parera accepted, but after many days no result was presented. Finally, he refused, being a Spaniard himself, as the lyrics were offensive to Spain, and he feared the reaction of the King. He was jailed by the Assembly and forced to compose under threat of execution. In a single night he finished the partiture, by simply copying the musical score he had composed for the theatre play. He was then released and later he abandoned the country forever, living for many years at Rio de Janeiro and later in Spain, where he died.The finished song was first played on May 14 1813 at the home of the aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, and presented publicly on May 25 of the same year. It was then known as Canción Patriótica Nacional (National Patriotic Song), and later simply as Canción Patriótica (Patriotic Song), but in an 1847 copy it appears under the title Himno Nacional Argentino, retaining that name until today.In the complete version of the Anthem of May (as was christened by López) it is noted that the political vision portrayed is not only Argentinian, but Latin American. The lyrics are burningly independentist and anti-Spanish, as the country was at that time fighting for its independence from Spain. The anthem suffered a modification in 1860, commended to the musician Juan Pablo Esnaola, who arranged a more orchestrated and harmonically richer version of the original music.Along the 19th century, the Anthem was sung in its entirety. However, once the harsh feelings against Spain had disappeared, and the country had become home to many Spanish immigrants, a modification was introduced by a decree by President Roca on March 30 1900. The decree read as follows:"Without producing alterations in the lyrics of the National Anthem, there are in it verses that perfectly describe the concept that nations universally have regarding their anthems in peaceful times, and that harmonize with the serenity and dignity of thousands of Spanish that share our living, those that can and must be preferred to be sung in official parties, for they respect the traditions and the law in no offence to anyone, the President of the Republic decrees that:In official or public parties, as well as in public schools, shall be sung only the first and last verses and the chorus of the National Song sanctioned by the General Assembly on May 11 1813."In this way the lyrics which contained vivid attacks against Spain stopped being sung publicly. On August 2 1924, another executive resolution, inspired in an investigation commanded by the government, sanctioned that the music composed by Parera, with the arrangements added by Esnaola, would constitute the music that would be played with the singing of the anthem in public events, forbidding the musical variations that had taken place until then.Performance of the anthem is mandatory during all official events, and those in attendance are expected to stand up and sing it. Radio broadcasters voluntarily perform the anthem at midnight, while TV channels do so before closing down their daily broadcast. On national holidays, it is mandatory to perform the anthem at midnight and noon.The Anthem is ruled in Argentine law by the Decree 10302/1944. The rock musician Charly García broke a long-standing tradition of "respect" when he included an idiosyncratic cover version of the National Anthem in his 1990 album Filosofía barata y zapatos de goma. In 1998 various Argentinian artists reedited the Anthem and other patriotic songs in the joint album El Grito Sagrado.Modern VersionThe following is the modern version, adopted in 1900, without the vivid attacks against Spain.Spanish lyricsEnglish translationOíd, mortales, el grito sagrado: Hear, mortals, the sacred cry:EstribilloChorusOriginal versionThe original version, Marcha Patriótica, is as follows:Spanish lyricsEnglish translationOíd, mortales, el grito sagrado:Mortals! Hear the sacred scream:CoroChorusDe los nuevos campeones los rostrosFrom the new Champions their facesPero sierras y muros se sientenMountain ranges and walls are felt¿No los véis sobre México y QuitoDon't you see them over Mexico and QuitoA vosotros se atreve, argentinos,To you it dares, Argentinians,El valiente argentino a las armasThe valiant Argentinian to armsSan José, San Lorenzo, Suipacha,San José, San Lorenzo, Suipacha,La victoria al guerrero argentinoVictory to the Argentine warriorDesde un polo hasta el otro resuenaFrom one pole to the other resoundsSean eternos los laurelesMay the laurels be eternal,Short instrumental versionDue to the excessive length of the official version, in international events such as the Olympic Games and football (soccer) games, only the instrumental introduction (which lasts 1 minute 6 seconds) is played. Another variation yet is to play the musical break that leads into the chorus, the chorus itself and the ending (coda.) Although traditional, this arrangement is not recognized by Argentine law.Recordings   NotesExternal linksArgentine National Anthem MP3Argentine National Anthem MP3Argentine National Anthem MP3Listen in the Quechua languageArgentine National Anthem english subtitled onYouTube.Category:Argentine culture Category:National anthems Category:Spanish-language songsar:نشيد الأرجنتين الوطني ast:Himnu Nacional Arxentín de:Himno Nacional Argentino el:Εθνικός ύμνος της Αργεντινής es:Himno Nacional Argentino eo:Himno Nacional Argentino eu:Himno Nacional Argentino fr:Hymne national argentin ga:Himno Nacional Argentino gv:Himno Nacional Argentino ko:아르헨티나의 국가 id:Himno Nacional Argentino it:Himno Nacional Argentino he:המנון ארגנטינה jv:Oid, Mortales lt:Argentinos himnas hu:Argentína himnusza ms:Oid, Mortales na:Himno Nacional Argentino nl:Himno Nacional Argentino ja:アルゼンチンの国歌 no:Oid, Mortales pl:Hymn Argentyny pt:Hino nacional da Argentina ro:Himno Nacional Argentino qu:Arhintinap llaqta takin ru:Гимн Аргентины sq:Oid, Mortales simple:Argentine National Anthem sr:Oid, Mortales sh:Argentinska nacionalna himna fi:Himno Nacional Argentino sv:Argentinas nationalsång vi:Himno Nacional Argentino tg:Суруди миллии Аргентина tr:Arjantin Milli Marşı bat-smg:Argentėnas himnos zh:祖国进行曲
