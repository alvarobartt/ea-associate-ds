(This one happens to be an injection)]] In mathematics, a function f'' is said to be '''surjective' or onto, if its values span its whole codomain; that is, for every y'' in the codomain, there is at least one ''x in the domain such that f''(''x) = y .Said another way, a function f'':&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Y'' is surjective if and only if its range ''f(X'') is equal to its codomain ''Y. A surjective function is called a surjection.Examples and a counterexampleFor any set X'', the identity function id''X on X is surjective.The function f'':&nbsp;'R'&nbsp;→&nbsp;'R''' defined by f''(''x) = 2''x'' + 1 is surjective (and even bijective), because for every real number y'' we have an ''x such that f''(''x) = y'': an appropriate ''x is (y - 1)/2.The natural logarithm function ln:&nbsp;(0,+∞)&nbsp;→&nbsp;R is surjective.The function f'':&nbsp;'Z'&nbsp;→&nbsp;'' defined by ''f(x'') = ''x mod 4 is surjective.The function g'':&nbsp;'R'&nbsp;→&nbsp;'R''' defined by g''(''x)&nbsp;= x''² is ''not surjective, because (for example) there is no real number x'' such that ''x²&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1. However, the function g'':&nbsp;'R'&nbsp;→&nbsp;'[0,+∞)' defined by ''g(x'')&nbsp;= ''x² (with restricted codomain) is surjective.There always exists a function &quot;reversible&quot; by a surjectionEvery function with a right inverse is a surjection. The converse is equivalent to the axiom of choice. That is, assuming the axiom of choice, a function f'':&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Y'' is surjective if and only if there exists a function ''g:&nbsp;Y''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''X such that, for every y \in Yf(g(y)) = y \, (g'' can be undone by ''f)that is a function g'' such that ''f&nbsp;o&nbsp;g'' equals the identity function on ''Y (cf. with definition of inverse function).Note that g'' may not be a complete inverse of ''f because the composition in the other order, g''&nbsp;o&nbsp;''f, may not be the identity on X''. In other words, f can undo or "''reverse" g, but not necessarily can be reversed by it. Surjections are not always invertible (bijective).For example, in the first illustration, there is some function g'' such that ''g© = 4. There is also some function f'' such that ''f(4) = C. It doesn't matter that g© can also equal 3; it only matters that f'' "reverses" ''g.Other propertiesIf f'' and ''g are both surjective, then f''&nbsp;o&nbsp;''g is surjective.If f''&nbsp;o&nbsp;''g is surjective, then f'' is surjective (but ''g need not be).f'':&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Y'' is surjective if and only if, given any functions ''g,h'':''Y&nbsp;→&nbsp;Z'', whenever ''g&nbsp;o&nbsp;f''&nbsp;= ''h&nbsp;o&nbsp;f'', then ''g&nbsp;=&nbsp;h''. In other words, surjective functions are precisely the epimorphisms in the category [[Category of sets|'Set''']] of sets.If f'':&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Y'' is surjective and ''B is a subset of Y'', then ''f(f''&nbsp;&minus;1(''B))&nbsp;=&nbsp;B''. Thus, ''B can be recovered from its preimage f''&nbsp;&minus;1(''B).For any function h'':&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Z'' there exists a surjection ''f:X''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''Y and injection g'':''Y&nbsp;→&nbsp;Z'' such that ''h&nbsp;= g''&nbsp;o&nbsp;''f. To see this, define Y'' to be the sets ''h&nbsp;&minus;1(z'') where ''z is in Z''. These sets are disjoint and partition ''X. Then f'' carries each ''x to the element of Y'' which contains it, and ''g carries each element of Y'' to the point in ''Z to which h'' sends its points. Then ''f is surjective since it is a projection map, and g is injective by definition.By collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image, every surjection induces a bijection defined on a quotient of its domain. More precisely, every surjection f'' : ''A → B'' can be factored as a projection followed by a bijection as follows. Let ''A/~ be the equivalence classes of A'' under the following equivalence relation: ''x ~ y'' if and only if ''f(x'') = ''f(y''). Equivalently, ''A/~ is the set of all preimages under f''. Let ''P(~) : A'' → ''A/~ be the projection map which sends each x'' in ''A to its equivalence class [x'']~, and let ''fP'' : ''A/~ → B'' be the well-defined function given by ''fP''([''x]~) = f''(''x). Then f'' = ''fP'' o ''P(~).If f'':&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Y'' is a surjective function, then ''X has at least as many elements as Y, in the sense of cardinal numbers.If both X'' and ''Y are finite with the same number of elements, then f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''X&nbsp;→&nbsp;Y'' is surjective if and only if ''f is injective.See alsoBijective functionInjective functionCategory:Functions and mappings Category:Basic concepts in set theory Category:Mathematical relationsbg:Сюрекция ca:Funció suprajectiva cs:Zobrazení na da:Surjektiv de:Surjektivität es:Función sobreyectiva eo:Surĵeto fr:Surjection ko:전사 함수 he:פונקציה על hr:Surjektivna funkcija io:Surjektio it:Funzione suriettiva lt:Siurjekcija nl:Surjectie ja:全射 oc:Subrejeccion pl:Funkcja &quot;na&quot; pt:Função sobrejectiva ru:Сюръекция sk:Surjektívne zobrazenie sl:Surjektivna preslikava sr:Сурјективно пресликавање fi:Surjektio sv:Surjektiv uk:Сюр'єкція zh:满射
