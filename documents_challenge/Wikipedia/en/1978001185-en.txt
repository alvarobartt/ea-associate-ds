   Uniform Resource Locator is an URI which also specifies where the identified resource is available and the protocol for retrieving it.RFC 1738 - Uniform Resource Locators In popular usage and many technical documents, it is often confused as a synonym for Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which are not required to specify how to locate the resource.URL syntax in brief Every URL begins with the scheme name that defines its namespace, purpose, and the syntax of the remaining part of the URL. Most Web-enabled programs will try to dereference a URL according to the semantics of its scheme and a context-vbn. For example, a Web browser will usually dereference a http://example.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; by performing an HTTP request to the host example.org, at the default HTTP port (see Port 80). Dereferencing the URL mailto:bob@example.com will usually start an e-mail composer with the address bob@example.com in the To field.example.com is a domain name; an IP address or other network address might be used instead. In addition, URLs that specify https as a scheme (such as https://example.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) normally denote a secure web site.The hostname portion of a URL, if present, is case insensitive (since the DNS is specified to ignore case); other parts are not required to be, but may be treated as case insensitive by some clients and servers, especially those that are based on Microsoft Windows. For example:http://en.wikipedia.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and HTTP://EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG/ will both open same page.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is correct, but http://en.wikipedia.org/WIKI/URL/&lt;/tt&gt; will result in an HTTP 404 error page.URLs as locatorsIn its current strict technical meaning, a URL is a URI that, “in addition to identifying a resource, provides a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network ‘location’).”Tim Berners-Lee, Roy T. Fielding, Larry Masinter. (January 2005). “Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax”. Internet Society. RFC 3986; STD 66.Internet hostnames On the Internet, a hostname is a domain name assigned to a host computer. This is usually a combination of the host's local name with its parent domain's name. For example, "en.wikipedia.org" consists of a local hostname ("en") and the domain name "wikipedia.org". This kind of hostname is translated into an IP address via the local hosts file, or the Domain Name System (DNS) resolver. It is possible for a single host computer to have several hostnames; but generally the operating system of the host prefers to have one hostname that the host uses for itself.Any domain name can also be a hostname, as long as the restrictions mentioned below are followed. So, for example, both "en.wikimedia.org" and "wikimedia.org" are hostnames because they both have IP addresses assigned to them. The domain name "pmtpa.wikimedia.org" is not a hostname since it does not have an IP address, but "rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org" is a hostname. All hostnames are domain names, but not all domain names are hostnames.See alsoCURIE (Compact URI)Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI)Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)URL normalizationURI schemeReferencesExternal linksRFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&lt;nowiki&gt;[Text]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] [http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html&lt;nowiki&gt;[HTML]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]Category:Internet standards Category:Identifiersaf:Uniform Resource Locator als:URL ar:عنوان إنترنت az:URL be-x-old:URL bg:Унифициран локатор на ресурси ca:Uniform Resource Locator cs:Uniform Resource Locator cy:URL da:URL de:Uniform Resource Locator el:Uniform Resource Locator es:Localizador Uniforme de Recursos eo:URL eu:Uniform Resource Locator fr:Uniform Resource Locator gl:URL ko:URL hr:URL id:URL is:Veffang it:Uniform Resource Locator he:URL kn:ಯು.ಆರ್.ಎಲ್ kk:URL lv:Vienotais resursu vietrādis lb:Uniform Resource Locator hu:Webcím nl:Uniform Resource Locator ja:Uniform Resource Locator no:Uniform Resource Locator km:URL pl:Uniform Resource Locator pt:URL ro:Uniform Resource Locator ru:URL simple:Uniform Resource Locator sk:Uniform Resource Locator sl:URL sv:Uniform Resource Locator th:Uniform Resource Locator vi:URL tg:URL tr:URL uk:Уніфікований локатор ресурсів ur:یکساں وسیلی تعینگر yo:Uniform Resource Locator zh-yue:URL zh:统一资源定位符
