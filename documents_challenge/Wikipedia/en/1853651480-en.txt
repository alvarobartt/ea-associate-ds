 The Venice Film Festival  is the oldest film festival in the world. Founded by Count Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata in 1932 as the "Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica", the festival has since taken place every year in late August or early September on the island of the Lido, Venice, Italy. Screenings take place in the historic Palazzo del Cinema on the Lungomare Marconi. It is one of the world's most prestigious film festivals and is part of the Venice Biennale, a major biennial exhibition and festival for contemporary art.The festival's principal awards are the Leone d'Oro (Golden Lion), which is awarded to the best film screened at the festival, and the Coppa Volpi (Volpi Cup), which is awarded to the best actor and actress. In 2002, the San Marco Award has been introduced, for the best film of the Controcorrente (Against the stream) section.For the most recent Venice Film Festivals, see the 62nd (2005), the 63rd (2006), the 64th (2007), and this year's 2008 65th Venice International Film Festival.Golden Lion winnersSee a list of winners at Golden LionThe Golden Lion is the festival's principal award for best film.Silver LionSee list of winners at Silver LionSilver Lions are an irregular award presented in some years as a "runners-up" prize to the Golden Lion.
