In such a short time they already built a small collection of collectors coins, with face value ranging from 3 to 100 euro. Although they are all legal tender in Slovenia, these coins are not really intended to be used as means of payment, so generally they do not circulate (the only exception is the 3 euro coins which can be found in circulation although rarely).

The general public was also invited through the mass media to participate in a public tender concerning proposals of motifs (132 tenderers proposed 699 motifs). A special expert commission (9 different individual experts and members of different institutions, including the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Slovenia) dealt with the proposals and the process. The second stage of selection started when the Government of the Republic of Slovenia confirmed the commission's decision that invitations would be addressed to some prominent designers for the production of designs.The commission invited five well-known Slovene designers. A special jury of reputable Slovene artists, designers, professors and connoisseurs of Slovene cultural heritage was appointed to review and assess the designs submitted for the Slovene euro coins. The commission of the Bank of Slovenia and Ministry of Finance unanimously agreed with the proposed selected designs prepared by Mr Miljenko Licul, along with Ms Maja Licul and Mr Janez Boljka. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia gave their consent and adopted the decision on 28 July 2005 to submit the selected design proposals for the national side of the Slovene euro coins to ECOFIN (Economic and Financial Committee) - Coins Sub-Committee, which acknowledged the compliance of the Slovene design proposals with European legislation on 5 October 2005. ControversyThe use of the Prince's Stone (Slovenian Knežji kamen, German Fürstenstein) on the 2-cent coin caused a minor political stir in the Austrian State of Carinthia. The stone, fragment ofan ancient Roman column from nearby Virunum that was used in the ritual of installing the princes of Carantania and later of the Duchy of Carinthia, is kept in a museum in Klagenfurt (Slovene: Celovec), the Carinthian capital, where it is also considered a historical icon of the state. The Carinthian state government (headed by governor Jörg Haider) issued a resolution of protest on 25 October 2005, which was rejected as "not to be taken seriously" by the then Slovenian foreign minister, Dimitrij Rupel. However, there were also objections against its use on the Slovene side. On academic grounds, for instance, Peter Štih, professor of history at the Ljubljana University and member of the Slovene Academy of Sciences, argued that the Prince's Stone cannot be considered a Slovenian but rather a Carinthian historic symbol.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stih&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesNotesExternal linksEuropean Central Bank – Information about the Slovenian euro coinsThe effigies of the new Slovene euro coins (from the Bank of Slovenia)Slovene euro coins on the official website of the Slovenian adoption of the euroThe Euro Information Website – SloveniaCategory:Coins of the Eurozone Category:Economy of Sloveniafrp:Piéces en erô de la Slovènie bar:Slowénische Euromünzn bs:Slovenske euro kovanice cs:Slovinské euromince cy:Darnau ewro Slofenia de:Slowenische Euromünzen el:Σλοβενικά κέρματα ευρώ es:Monedas de euro de Eslovenia eo:Slovenaj eŭro-moneroj ext:Moneas d'euru d'Eslovénia eu:Esloveniako euro txanponak fr:Pièces en euro de la Slovénie hr:Slovenske euro kovanice it:Monete euro slovene lb:Slowenesch Euromënzen hu:Szlovén euróérmék nl:Sloveense euromunten ja:スロベニアのユーロ硬貨 pms:Monede Euro dla Slovenia pl:Słoweńskie monety euro pt:Moedas de euro eslovenas sk:Slovinské euromince sl:Slovenski evrokovanci sh:Slovenske euro kovanice fi:Slovenialaiset eurokolikot sv:Slovenska euromynt zh:斯洛維尼亞的歐元硬幣
