In Greek mythology, Memnon was an Ethiopian king and son of Tithonus and Eos. At the Trojan War, he brought an army to Troy's defense and was killed by Achilles in retribution for killing Antilochus. The death of Memnon echoes that of Hector, another defender of Troy whom Achilles also killed out of revenge for a fallen comrade, Antilochus. After Memnon's death, Zeus was moved by Eos' tears and granted him immortality.Memnon's death is related at length in the lost epic Aethiopis, composed after The Iliad circa the 7th century BC. Quintus of Smyrna records Memnon's death in Posthomerica.Category:Greek mythology Category:People of the Trojan War Category:Rulers of Ethiopia Category:Mythological kingsbg:Мемнон ca:Memnó de:Memnon (Mythologie) el:Μέμνων (μυθολογία) es:Memnón fr:Memnon (mythologie) it:Memnone (mitologia) lt:Memnonas nl:Memnon no:Memnon pl:Memnon pt:Memnon ru:Мемнон (мифология) sr:Мемнон fi:Memnon (mytologia) zh:門農
