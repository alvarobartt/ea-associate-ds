The club’s first games outside of the Colombia were against a team comprised of players representing Caracas, Venezuela on November 23, 1926. Two days later, on November 25, the team played in La Guaira, Venezuela. Cúcuta Sports Club became the base of the Norte de Santander football team that took part in the first Colombian National Games (Juegos Deportivos Nacionales de Colombia) in 1928 in the city of Cali.On May 15, 1949, the president of the Colombian football league invited the directors of Club Colpet, Chinaquillo, Guasimales, and Unión Frontera to strengthen Cúcuta Deportivo in order to compete in the new Colombian professional football league. In order to facilitate the economic reforms required to join the league, Hernando Lara Hernández bought 1,700 shares in the club in September of the same year.Between September and November 1949, before beginning its first campaign in the Colombian league, Cúcuta played Hurucán de Medellín, Universidad de Bogotá, Boca Juniors de Cali, and Atlético Bucaramanga. The last of these, Atlético Bucaramanga, is Cúcuta's archrival and their games are called the clásico of Western Colombia.In the late fifties and early sixties, the team was under the chairmanship of Marino Vargas Villalta. Under his supervision, the team reached second place in the 1964 DIMAYOR tournament. In the second half of 2006, the team won the Colombian League for the first time in its history by defeating finalist Deportes Tolima 2 goals to 1.
