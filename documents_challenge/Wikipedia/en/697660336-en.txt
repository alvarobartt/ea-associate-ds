  DragonForce are a British band formed in 1999.HistoryDragonForce was formed in 1998 from the remnants of the band Demoniac under the name of DragonHeart, but they changed their name to DragonForce before releasing any commercial albums due to possible issues with Brazilian band Dragonheart. Their career began with the publishing of their early songs on the first incarnation of MP3.com, claiming the top of the site's heavy metal charts. The hit song "Valley of the Damned" reached over 500,000 downloads in the first few months. Two of the original members, Steve Williams and Steve Scott, left the band to form the power metal outfit Power Quest. Sam Totman also started a side project called Shadow Warriors featuring himself and ZP Theart. Sam has confirmed many times that Herman Li was not involved with Shadow Warriors.The band's first successful song was "Starfire" from their debut album, Valley of the Damned. It was most noted because it starts off with a piano intro, which is atypical among DragonForce songs. DragonForce have released four studio albums and toured extensively while supporting Helloween, W.A.S.P. and Iron Maiden. Their 2005 tour in support of the Sonic Firestorm album included support from Angra and Mendeed during their passage through the UK. On October 28, 2005 bassist Adrian Lambert announced his departure from the band in order to focus more time on raising his young sonMetal Hammer, November 2006, pg 40 "DragonForce interview" Less than a month after Lambert's departure, on November 23, 2005, DragonForce were signed to Roadrunner Records in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia and New Zealand, who released their third studio album, Inhuman Rampage on January 9, 2006. Lambert was replaced in 2006 by Frédéric Leclercq, who was made an official member after a performance on tour.The song "Through the Fire and Flames" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and is generally considered to be the hardest track in the ''Guitar Hero'' series. The developers used the song to demonstrate the game at E3. After Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock was released, the band's music sales increased dramatically. Their song being featured in the game has successfully placed the band into mainstream performances.A new DragonForce album, titled Ultra Beatdown was released on August 26, 2008. This will be followed by an extensive North American tour through October with Turisas and then followed by a tour of Australia and the UK.July 4th saw the release of DragonForce's first single from the new album, "Heroes of Our Time", released only on their MySpace page; however, it is also available on iTunes. The video for it was released on the band's official YouTube channel on July 9.Musical styleDragonForce's musical style includes:Emphasis on fast, twin-guitar harmonies in speed metal styles.Lyrics of a fantastical or epic nature, with a hopeful and optimistic attitude, often with recurring themes and lyrical phrases in multiple songsLyrics which emphasize comradeship and hopeUse of multi-tracked backing vocalsUse of keyboards throughout songsVideo game-influenced melodies and noisesAlthough the band takes their musicianship seriously, they do not embody the themes in their music.
