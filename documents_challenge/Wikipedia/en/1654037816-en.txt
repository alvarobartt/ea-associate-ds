It implements nearly all of the features of the corresponding OpenOffice.org version, including a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation program, and graphics program. It is developed by Planamesa Software, and uses Java technology to integrate OpenOffice.org — originally developed for Solaris and Linux — with the Aqua interface of Mac OS X.Characteristics &amp; developmentNeoOffice is one of two functional OpenOffice.org-based packages for Mac OS X; the other is "OpenOffice.org for Mac OS X (X11)", a version developed and distributed by the OpenOffice.org team, which currently runs in an X11 environment and requires either X11.app or XDarwin to be installed (although an Aqua version is nearing release.OOo Aqua Timeline) Because of software license differences (see below), NeoOffice code cannot be used in the official OpenOffice.org versions. Furthermore, the NeoOffice developers have stated that they prefer to work separately from OpenOffice.org because "coordination requires a significant amount of time";NeoOffice FAQ's on the other side, the OpenOffice.org developers state: "A proposal to work together has been made, and NeoOffice developers refused".FAQ Openoffice.org and NeoOffice from the OOo wikiNeoOffice is currently the more "Mac-like" of the two, with easier installation, better integration into the OS X interface (with pull down menus at the top of the screen, and familiar keyboard shortcuts, for example), use of Mac OS X's fonts and printing services without additional configuration, and integration with the Mac OS X clipboard and drag-and-drop functions.However, it requires more memory than the X11 version to perform well, some functions are allegedly slower, and the additional code it adds to the main OpenOffice.org code base is not as fully tested. Because NeoOffice is based on releases of OpenOffice.org, there is a delay between those releases and corresponding versions of NeoOffice. Furthermore, because NeoOffice's small development team have been concurrently developing the technology for its user interface, these delays have often been several months in length.As of June 2008, the latest version of NeoOffice is 2.2.4. This version is based on OpenOffice.org 2.2.1, and is available for both Intel- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes. In addition to incorporating the source application's new features, it is based directly on the source code for the Linux and Solaris versions rather than the "Mac OS X (X11)" releases, with a redesigned interface using Apple's Aqua design elements, giving the application an appearance more similar to other Mac OS X software. A new icon set introduced in version 2.1 uses designs that more closely resemble typical Mac OS X icons.With version 2.2.1, NeoOffice has access to the Mac OS X spellchecker and address book; users of languages not supported by the OS X spellchecker can use the Hunspell system originally used. In addition to the file formats supported by OpenOffice.org, NeoOffice can import, edit, and save documents created with Microsoft Word 2007 and can execute Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications macros. The current release also adds experimental support for Excel 2007 and PowerPoint 2007 documents.NeoOffice 2.2.1 release announcementNeoOffice vs OpenOffice.org 3.0While OpenOffice.org 2.x.x for Mac OS X does not currently use the Aqua window system, starting with OpenOffice.org 3.0, this will be supported. The current release candidate http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/download/aqua.html&lt;/ref&gt; of OpenOffice.org has a working Aqua interface, filling the gaps that the old X11 based version left. OpenOffice.org 3.0 is scheduled for release in Fall 2008. The developers of NeoOffice have said they will continue to release future versions of NeoOffice.NeoOffice Trinity Forums ('plumby' and 'OPENSTEP' are the 2 main developers of NeoOffice)LicensingOpenOffice.org was originally released under both the LGPL and SISSL; it is now released solely under the LGPL. However, OpenOffice.org requires a copyright assignment for contributions to the main code base; this allows Sun to create proprietary versions of the software (notably StarOffice). NeoOffice chooses not to assign their code to Sun; this prevents NeoOffice code from being used in official OpenOffice.org versions. Instead, NeoOffice is released only under the GPL (this is allowed by the LGPL), which ensures that any software based on it remains free.HistoryNeoOffice began as a project to investigate methods of creating a native port of OpenOffice.org to Mac OS X. The project now called NeoOffice was originally dubbed "NeoOffice/J", reflecting its use of OS X's Java integration to enable a native application. A related project was NeoOffice/C, which was a simultaneous effort to develop a version using Apple's Cocoa APIs. But NeoOffice/C proved very difficult to implement and the application was highly unstable, so the project was set aside in favor of the more promising NeoOffice/J. The "/J" suffix was dropped with version 1.2, since there was no longer another variety of NeoOffice from which to distinguish it.OOo]] versionVersionRelease dateOther Notes1.1NeoOffice/C 0.0.1June 22, 2003Incendiary Goblin build1.1.2NeoOffice/J 1.1 Alpha 2September, 20041.1.3NeoOffice/J 1.1 BetaDecember, 20041.1.4NeoOffice/J 1.1 RCMarch, 2005NeoOffice/J 1.1June 22, 20051.1.5NeoOffice 1.2 AlphaNovember, 2005NeoOffice 1.2 BetaJanuary 2, 2006NeoOffice 1.2February 1, 2006NeoOffice 1.2.2March 30, 20052.0.2NeoOffice 2.0 Alpha PowerPCApril 25, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Alpha 2 PowerPCMay 9, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Alpha 3 PowerPCMay 23, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Alpha IntelJune 5, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Alpha 2 IntelJune 19, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Alpha 4July 1, 20062.0.3NeoOffice 2.0 Aqua BetaAugust 1, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Aqua Beta 2August 15, 2006NeoOffice 2.0 Aqua Beta 3August 29, 20062.1NeoOffice 2.1 Early AccessFebruary 27, 2007Only Available to Early Access MembersNeoOffice 2.1March 26, 2007General public release2.2.1NeoOffice 2.2.1 Early AccessJuly 23, 2007Only Available to Early Access MembersNeoOffice 2.2.1August 27, 2007General public releaseNeoOffice 2.2.2October 9, 2007bug fixes 2.2.2 Release NotesNeoOffice 2.2.3March 17, 2008QuickTime video support, Menus available when no documents are open, Import images from scanners and cameras 2.2.3 Release NotesNeoOffice 2.2.4June 16, 2008media browser support, native floating tool windows, support for newer trackpad gestures, support for horizontal scrolling, NeoOffice 2.2.4 Announcement2.2.4 Release NotesNeoOffice 2.2.5September 15, 2008bug fixes, speed improvements, apple remote support in Impress NeoOffice 2.2.5 Announcement2.2.5 Release NotesNotesSee alsoList of office suitesComparison of office suitesExternal linksNeoOfficeNeoWikiCategory:OpenOffice.org Category:Open source office suites Category:Mac OS X word processorsar:نيو أوفيس da:NeoOffice de:NeoOffice et:NeoOffice es:NeoOffice fr:NeoOffice it:NeoOffice nl:NeoOffice ja:NeoOffice pl:NeoOffice pt:NeoOffice sv:NeoOffice
