Billon is an alloy of a precious metal (most commonly silver, but also gold) with a majority base metal content (such as copper). It is used chiefly for making coins, medals, and token coins.The word originates from the middle Latin billo, meaning "a coin containing mostly copper", or just "unit of payment".Use of billon coins date through Middle Ages to ancient Greece. During 6th and 5th century BC, some cities on Lesbos island used coins made of 60% copper and 40% silver. In both ancient times and the Middle Ages, leaner mixtures were adopted, with less than 2% silver content.DIOCLETIAN AND CONSTANTINEAmerican Treasure and the Price Revolution in Spain, 1501-1650See alsoMetalBullionList of alloysAntoninianusReferencesCategory:Precious metal alloys Category:Currency production Category:Silverbe-x-old:Білон bg:Билонни монети ca:Billó de:Billon es:Vellón (aleación) fr:Billon (alliage) it:Biglione ka:ბილონური მონეტა nl:Biljoengoud pl:Bilon pt:Bilhão (liga) ro:Bilon ru:Билон sv:Billon vi:Bilon uk:Білонна монета
