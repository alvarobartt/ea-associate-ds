Many of the selections are appropriately self-absorbed but move beyond journalistic catharsis to real insight and stunning language for one so young."In October 2006, Tamblyn did several poetry readings in California, including a few with poet Derrick Brown.Amber appears in an upcoming poetry concert film recorded on August 4, 2007 in Los Angeles, "The Drums Inside Your Chest."
