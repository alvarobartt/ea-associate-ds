Michel Rolle (April 21, 1652 - November 8, 1719) was a French mathematician. He is best known for Rolle's theorem (1691). He also invented the current standardized notation\sqrtnto denote the ''n''th root of \displaystyle x.LifeRolle was born in Ambert, Basse-Auvergne. In 1675, he moved from Ambert to Paris and was elected in 1685 to join the Académie Royale des Sciences and became a Pensionnaire Géometre of the Académie (1699). He had then already been given a pension by Jean-Baptiste Colbert after solving one of Jacques Ozanam's problems.Rolle was an early critic of calculus, arguing that it was inaccurate and based upon unsound reasoning. He later changed his opinion. He was also the first person presently known to have placed the index in the opening of a radical to denote the n-th root of a number (Cajori, A History of Mathematical Notation).Rolle died in Paris.External linksCategory:1652 births Category:1719 deaths Category:French mathematicianscs:Michel Rolle da:Michel Rolle de:Michel Rolle es:Michel Rolle fr:Michel Rolle ko:미셸 롤 it:Michel Rolle ht:Michel Rolle hu:Michel Rolle nl:Michel Rolle pl:Michel Rolle ro:Michel Rolle ru:Ролль, Мишель sr:Мишел Рол zh:米歇尔·罗尔
