Estonian euro coins feature only a single design for all eight coins. This is a design by Lembit Lõhmus and features a map of Estonia together with the word Eesti (Estonia) and the twelve stars surrounding the map. This was the winning design in a public vote of ten announced in December 2004.Estonian euro coins are not currently in circulation since Estonia does not yet use the euro as its currency. Estonia and the other nine states that joined the EU in 2004 have committed to adopting the euro. Of the ten new member states, Estonia was the first to unveil its design. It originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007; however, it did not formally apply when Slovenia did, and officially changed its target date to 1 January 2008, and later, to 1 January 2010.Estonian euro designFor images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.External linksEstonian euro coin designs chosen for the national voteWinning design of the Estonian eurocoins competition disclosedEstonia's official website regarding the changeover to the euroThe Euro Information Website – EstoniaEesti Pank (Central Bank of Estonia)Category:Coins of the Eurozone Category:Economy of Estoniafrp:Piéces en erô de l’Èstonie cs:Estonské euromince da:Estiske euromønter de:Estnische Euromünzen el:Εσθονικά κέρματα ευρώ es:Monedas de euro de Estonia eo:Estonaj eŭro-moneroj fr:Pièces en euro de l'Estonie ko:에스토니아의 유로 동전 it:Monete euro estoni hu:Észt euróérmék nl:Estische euromunten ja:エストニアのユーロ硬貨 pl:Estońskie monety euro sk:Estónske euromince sl:Estonski evrokovanci fi:Virolaiset eurokolikot sv:Estniska euromynt zh:愛沙尼亞的歐元硬幣
