  PunkBuster is a computer program published by Even Balance, Inc. Its purpose is to prevent cheating in online games by banning players.It has been deployed in several popular multiplayer online games, including the Battlefield series, America's Army, Crysis, F.E.A.R., Call of Duty series, Quake III Arena, War Rock, among many more.HistoryTony Ray founded Even Balance to develop PunkBuster after his experience with cheaters on Team Fortress.The first beta of PunkBuster was announced on September 21, 2000 for Half-Life. Valve Software was at the time fighting a hard battle against cheating, which had been going on since the release of the game. The first game in which PunkBuster was integrated was id Software's Return to Castle Wolfenstein.PunkBuster in MMORPGs On June 18 to 19 of 2006, the MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game) Ultima Online announced that it was testing PunkBuster for use in that game. EA had claimed that there were numerous complaints about players cheating in Ultima Online, especially with player vs. player (PvP) combat and resource gathering. In regards to how bannings would be handled, Tony Ray, founder of PunkBuster, stated in an interview "we plan to leave all banning decisions to the UO team. For Ultima Online, PunkBuster is currently designed to report what it finds to the GMs and it is up to the UO team to enforce their own policies. At least in the beginning, players who are Hardware banned for hacking PunkBuster in some other game will not be Hardware banned in UO".As of 1 September, 2006, developers from Ultima Online's publisher, Electronic Arts, estimate that public testing of PunkBuster would begin in late September, 2006.In November 2006 it was announced that PunkBuster integration into UO is put on hold indefinitely for the moment since the team would rather concentrate on "internal fixes and security improvements" in the client code. On July 11, 2008 it was announced by Mythic Entertainment that they will be using Punkbuster to prevent cheating in Warhammer Online FeaturesPublished featuresReal-time scanning of memory, a feature also prominent in many spyware programs, by PunkBuster Client on players' computers searching for known hacks/cheats using a built-in database.Throttled two-tiered background auto-update system using multiple Internet Master Servers to provide end-user security ensuring that no false or corrupted updates can be installed on players' computers.Frequent status reports (encrypted) are sent to the PunkBuster Server by all players. When necessary, the PunkBuster Server raises a violation which (depending upon settings) will cause the offending player to be removed from the game and all other players to be informed of the violation.PunkBuster Admins can also manually remove players from the game for a specified number of minutes or permanently ban if desired.PunkBuster Servers can optionally be configured to randomly check player settings looking for known exploits of the game engine.PunkBuster Servers can be configured to instruct clients to calculate partial MD5 hashes of files inside the game installation directory. The results are compared against a set configuration and differences logged, and optionally, the client removed from the server.PunkBuster Admins can request actual screenshot samples from specific players and/or can configure the PB Server to randomly grab screenshot samples from players during gameplay.An optional "bad name" facility is provided so that PunkBuster Admins can prevent players from using offensive player names containing unwanted profanity or racial slurs.Search functions are provided for PunkBuster Admins who wish to search player's keybindings and scripts for anything that may be known to exploit the game.The PunkBuster Player Power facility can be configured to allow players to self-administer game servers when the Server Administrator is not present entirely without the need for passwords, in which the players can call votes to have a player removed from the server for a certain amount of time.PunkBuster Servers have an optional built-in mini HTTP web server interface that allows the game server to be remotely administered via a web browser from anywhere over the Internet.PunkBuster Admins can stream their server logs in real time to another location. Non-profit organizations like Anti-Cheat Inc., Airdale Ops Network , PunksBusted , PBBans and AASA are examples of groups that use this feature to create shared banlists for their members.PunkBuster has initiated Punkbuster Hardware Bans, that bans hardware components upon detection of cheats that disrupt or circumvent PunkBuster's normal operation.Unpublished featuresPunkBuster scans for unknown exports (APIs) in sensitive software such as graphics libraries. Upon finding an undocumented export a violation is raised and the client removed from the game.PunkBuster does not allow Windows users without administrative accounts to connect to any games. Upon connecting to a game, the user will be immediately kicked for having insufficient OS privileges. Starting with PB client v1.700, a windows service with full administrative rights is used in complement with the ingame PunkBuster client, allowing updates without user rights elevation. However, some games might still require administrative rights before PunkBuster will function correctly..IncompatibilitiesPeople using overclocking or tweaking programs have complained of instabilities with PunkBuster. For example, both ATI Tool and Rivatuner have incompatibilities. However in newer versions of Rivatuner there is an optional countermeasure.Some games (like Crysis) do not have a 64-bit version of PunkBuster. For this reason, 64 bit clients will not be able to play in PunkBuster enabled servers, unless they run the 32-bit client of the game.Complaints Many users find Punkbuster to be detrimental to their gaming experience. Punkbuster's side effects may include framerate drops and jitters or network latency spikes. For these reasons, some game servers choose to run with Punkbuster disabled, instead preferring to have server administrators deal with any cheaters directly rather than imposing a bad playing experience on many players. It also may conflict with Wine (software).Others complain that Punkbuster is not well integrated into games and can cause problems for users who do not cheat. In some games players are forced to be in a spectator mode while your Punkbuster client updates. This can take minutes and sometimes fails, leaving the user on their own to figure out how to update their Punkbuster.For example, when the Quake Live beta testing period started in July 2008, many users complained because they were kicked for Punkbuster related issues. While the in-browser game technology of Quake Live was new and hence cheats were most-likely extremely rare, many players continued to run into problems with Punkbuster even though most were almost certainly not cheating.EnforcementHardware bansAs of June 30 2004, Even Balance has incorporated the usage of unique hardware identifiers to permanently ban players from all PunkBuster enabled servers who raise a violation that corresponds to hacking or interfering with PunkBuster's normal operation and therefore violating the EULA.Even Balance uses multiple private one-way hashes so that no serial number information for individual computers can be determined by admins or anyone else who may try to obtain this information from a hardware GUID.PunkBuster only gives a hardware ban if memory scans show that a cheat that is known to circumvent or disrupt PunkBuster's normal operation or its facilities is activated.As with previous PunkBuster GUID global bans, the new hardware GUID bans are permanent and will not be lifted. Even Balance has not disclosed which hardware parts are used to ban players, but trial and error has shown that the hardware GUID is based on the serial numbers of all available hard drives and the MAC addresses (which can be changed with a simple fix in the Windows registry) of all available network interfaces.According to their EULA, Even Balance has the final say in matters of banning.Attacks on PunkBusterBeing a security system of sorts, PunkBuster is a target for attacks. As PunkBuster is frequently updated (using an auto-update feature) cheats are blacklisted shortly after being reported. While it is possible to create a new program, following the PunkBuster protocol that always reports that everything is as it should be, the frequent updates are a deterrent; such a program would quickly become outdated. So far there have not been any successful large-scale attacks on the system.Cheats are usually written by individuals with some knowledge of programming; however, in recent days cheat writers have organized private, limited membership-based cheating organizations. These groups usually offer a private cheat for their members. Such private cheats are usually touted as not being detected by PunkBuster and/or the Valve Anti-Cheat system, which is the official anticheat for GoldSrc, Source, and Unreal Engine 2 powered games on Steam. Since both anticheats usually search for known cheat programs as opposed to relying on a more heuristic approach, a copy of the cheat is usually needed before an update to detect it can be made. Therefore, the private nature of these cheat organizations makes for a harder-to-beat situation.In addition, PunkBuster incorporates a system called global banning. Either the GUID (generated from the CD key) or parts of the computer hardware are banned from PunkBuster enabled servers. Most cheats simply will get a detection, but cheats that interfere with PunkBuster's software could get a global GUID ban. This will disallow access to PunkBuster enabled servers for that particular game. Cheats which are even more interfering could end up being the user banned from all PunkBuster enabled games by a hardware ban.PunkBuster has also been hacked due to its out of date program. NetCoders, a company that is renowned for creating cheats for video games, attacked the PunkBuster anti-cheat system in March 2008. Two well known gamers under the handles Lio and AlexL were banned by PunkBuster during a ETTV NationsCup match between Belgium and Sweden when NetCoders came under control of the PB system. A few days after this incident, hundreds of players were banned by PunkBuster if PB scans detected any traces of the phrase "Rifle Aim Prediction." Popular Internet Relay channels used by Enemy Territory players became flooded with these words. Anybody who was in a channel with a person who knew about this fault in the PunkBuster system and who was running Enemy Territory at the same time would be banned for violation Game Hack. NetCoders removed this glitch within a week but Even Balance has neglected to correct the PunkBuster program.On March 23, 2008, attackers published and implemented a proof of concept exploit of PunkBuster's indiscriminate memory scanning. Because PunkBuster scans all of a machine's physical memory, malicious users were able to cause mass false positives by transmitting text fragments from known cheat programs onto a high population IRC channel. When PunkBuster detected the text within users' IRC client text buffers, the users were banned.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2008, Even Balance confirmed the existence of this exploit, and advised users not to run any other programs at the same time as PunkBuster protected games.&lt;/ref&gt;Games using PunkBusterAmerica's ArmyBattlefield 1942Battlefield 2Battlefield 2142Battlefield HeroesBattlefield VietnamCall of DutyCall of Duty 2Call of Duty 4Call of Duty: World at WarCrysisDoom 3Enemy Territory: Quake WarsFar CryF.E.A.R.''F.E.A.R.
