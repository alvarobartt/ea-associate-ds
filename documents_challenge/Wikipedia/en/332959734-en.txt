Begoniaceae is a family of flowering plants with about 1400 species occurring in the subtropics and tropics of both the New World and Old World. All but one of the species are in the genus Begonia. The only other genus in the family, Hillebrandia, is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and has a single species. Phylogenetic work supports Hillebrandia as the sister taxon to the rest of the family. The genus Symbegonia has recently been reduced to a section of Begonia as recent molecular phylogenies have shown it to be derived from within that genus.Members of the genus Begonia are well-known and popular houseplants.External links[http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/6/905 Phylogenetic position and biogeography of Hillebrandia sandwicensis (Begoniaceae): a rare Hawaiian relict][http://www.bioone.org/bioone/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=0363-6445&amp;volume=028&amp;issue=04&amp;page=0693 Phylogenetic Relationships of the Afro-Malagasy Members of the Large Genus Begonia Inferred from trnL Intron Sequences][http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aspt/sb/2005/00000030/00000003/art00017 A Phylogeny of Begonia Using Nuclear Ribosomal Sequence Data and Morphological Characters]A recircumscription of Begonia based on nuclear ribosomal sequencesCategory:Cucurbitalesde:Schiefblattgewächse es:Begoniaceae eo:Begoniacoj fr:Begoniaceae lt:Begoniniai nl:Begoniafamilie ja:シュウカイドウ科 no:Begoniafamilien pl:Begoniowate pt:Begoniaceae ru:Бегониевые sv:Begoniaväxter vi:Họ Thu hải đường zh:秋海棠科
