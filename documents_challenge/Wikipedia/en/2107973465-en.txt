[[Image:Helmuth von Moltke the Younger.jpg|thumb|'Helmuth von Moltke'Chief of the General Staff]] Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke (May 25 1848 &ndash; June 18 1916), also known as Moltke the Younger, was a nephew of Field Marshal Count Moltke and served as the Chief of the German General Staff from 1906 to 1914. The two are often differentiated as Moltke the Elder and Moltke the Younger. Moltke the Younger's role in the development of German war plans and the instigation of the First World War is extremely controversial.BiographyHelmuth von Moltke was born in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and named after his uncle, Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke, future Field Marshal and hero of the Wars of Unification. During the Franco-Prussian War Moltke served with the 7th Grenadier Regiment, and was cited for bravery. He attended the War Academy between 1875 and 1878 and joined the General Staff in 1880. In 1882 he became personal adjutant to his uncle, then Chief of the General Staff. In 1891, on the death of his uncle, Moltke became aide-de-camp to Wilhelm II, thus becoming part of the Emperor's inner circle. In the late 1890s he commanded first a brigade and then a division, finally being promoted to Lieutenant General in 1902. Annika Mombauer, Helmuth von Moltke and the Origins of the First World War (Cambridge University Press, 2001), 47-49In 1904 Moltke was made Quartermaster-General; in effect, Deputy Chief of the General Staff. In 1906, he became chief on Schlieffen's retirement. His appointment was controversial then and remains so today. The other likely candidates for the position were Hans Hartwig von Beseler, Karl von Bülow, and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz.Ibid, 68 Critics charge that Moltke gained the position on the strength of his name and his friendship with the Kaiser. Certainly Moltke was far closer to the Kaiser than the other candidates. Historians argue, however, that Beseler was too close to Schlieffen to have succeeded him, while Bülow and Goltz were too independent for Wilhelm to have accepted them. Indeed, Moltke's friendship with the Kaiser permitted him latitude with his majesty that others could not have enjoyed. It should be noted that Goltz, at least, saw nothing wrong with Moltke's performance as Chief. Ibid, 71During the Marne Campaign of 1914, as a consequence of a clash with the Kaiser very shortly before the start of the war, Moltke's health broke down and he was succeeded by Erich von Falkenhayn. Nevertheless it must be stated today, that his report to the Kaiser after the Marne Campaign: "Majesty, we lost the war" was strategically absolutely right. It is a matter of debate whether the "failure" of the Marne Campaign can be placed at Moltke's feet. A number of historians, notably Zuber and S.L.A. Marshall, contend that the failure of Alexander von Kluck's First Army to keep position with Karl von Bülow's Second Army, thus creating a gap near Paris that was exploited by the French, is a more direct cause than any planning foibles on Moltke's part. The Schlieffen School disagrees, and argues that Moltke lost control of the invading armies during the month of August and thus was unable to react when the First Battle of the Marne developed in September. While Moltke had lost effective touch with his field commanders, German operational doctrine had always stressed personal initiative on the part of subordinate officers, more so than in other armies. Other historians argue that the multitude of strategic options Moltke faced, and the danger of the Russian invasion of East Prussia clouded Moltke's judgement. The question remains however if such a dramatic and decisive event like the Battle of the Marne 1914 can be explained in a complete rational manner. Some French in these days argued that at the Marne happened a miracle ("Jeanne d'Arc defeated the Germans"). Moltke himself, who stoud in contact with Rudolf Steiner, also tried to look deeper in the history and its spiritual background.Moltke's health continued to deteriorate and he died in Berlin on June 18, 1916 during the funeral for Marschall von der Goltz.Notes  ReferencesTuchman, Barbara.The Guns of August 1914. 1962.Craig, Gordon.
