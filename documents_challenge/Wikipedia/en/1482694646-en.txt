The two sun roses are taken from the Warendorf coat of arms, which took it from the family coat of arms of the Vogt family in Warendorpe.

The coat of arms was granted in 1976.Towns and municipalitiesTownsMunicipalitiesExternal linksOfficial website (German)Category:Districts of North Rhine-Westphaliade:Kreis Warendorf es:Distrito de Warendorf eo:Distrikto Warendorf fr:Arrondissement de Warendorf id:Warendorf (distrik) it:Circondario di Warendorf nl:Warendorf (district) pl:Powiat Warendorf pt:Warendorf (distrito) ro:Warendorf (district) ru:Варендорф (район) simple:Warendorf Rural District fi:Warendorfin piirikunta zh:瓦伦多夫县
