Metacity (, rhyming with "capacity" with the stress on the second syllable) is a compositing window manager used by default in the GNOME desktop environment. The development of Metacity was started by Havoc Pennington and it is released under the GNU General Public License.Before the introduction of Metacity in GNOME 2.2, GNOME used Enlightenment and then Sawfish as its window manager. Although Metacity is part of the GNOME project and designed to integrate into the GNOME desktop, it does not require GNOME to run, and GNOME can be used with different window managers provided that they support the part of the ICCCM specification that GNOME requires.Metacity uses the GTK+ graphical widget toolkit to create its user interface components, which makes it themeable and makes it blend in with other GTK+ applications.PhilosophyMetacity's focus is on simplicity and usability rather than novelties or gimmicks. Its author has characterized it as a "Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like Cheerios."ThemesDespite the incomplete state of Metacity theme development documentation, many themes have been written for Metacity. A huge number of such themes can be downloaded from GNOME's art site, art.gnome.org. The most popular theme is Clearlooks, which has been GNOME's default theme since version 2.12.ControversyMetacity, unlike the previous choices for GNOME window manager, has few configuration options. Those in favour of Metacity say that GNOME is aimed at new computer users who do not need the extreme configurability of Sawfish or Enlightenment. Havoc Pennington wrote an essay explaining why he wrote Metacity and simplified the GNOME desktop. This lack of flexibility has led to the development of such add-ons as Devil's Pie and Brightside.ReferencesExternal linksMetacity blogMetacity Download SiteMetacity ThemesDesigning Metacity Themes, Glynn FosterDesigning Metacity Themes (Translation into German), Ingo Rybaczyk Category:Free X window managers Category:GNOME Category:Free software programmed in Ccy:Metacity de:Metacity es:Metacity fr:Metacity it:Metacity nl:Metacity ja:Metacity no:Metacity pl:Metacity pt:Metacity ru:Metacity sv:Metacity uk:Metacity zh:Metacity
