They contain many, usually unisexual flowers, arranged closely along a central stem which is often drooping. They are found in many plant families, including Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Moraceae, and Salicaceae. For some time, they were believed to be a key synapomorphy among the proposed Hamamelididae, but it is now believed that this flower arrangement has arisen independently by convergent evolution on a number of occasions.In many of these plants only the male flowers form catkins, and the female flowers are single (hazel, oak), a cone (alder) or other types (mulberry). In other plants (such as poplar) both male and female flowers are borne in catkins.Catkin-bearing plants include many other trees or shrubs such as birch, willow, hickory, sweet chestnut and sweetfern (Comptonia), and also some herbaceous plants such as nettle.Category:plant morphologyca:Ament (botànica) cs:Jehněda de:Kätzchen es:Amento eo:Amento fr:Chaton is:Rekill he:עגיל (בוטניקה) lt:Žirginys mk:Реса (ботаника) nl:Katje nds-nl:Katjen pl:Kotka (botanika) sl:Mačica sr:Реса (цваст) vi:Hoa đuôi sóc tr:Kedicik
