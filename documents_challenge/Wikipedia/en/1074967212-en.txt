She turned professional in 2003.As of February 2006, Grönefeld was the No. 1 tennis player from Germany. She was coached and trained by Rafael Font de Mora in Scottsdale, Arizona until 2006. Anna-Lena is currently coached by former German pro tennis player Dirk Dier (since the WTA tournament in Stuttart in October 2006).

She went on to win her first title at the Abierto Mexicano TELCEL in Acapulco, and completed a career best showing at Roland Garros, by reaching the quarterfinals, where she lost to Justine Henin. Her ranking peaked at 14. The good form was short-lived, as the German failed to progress beyond the quarterfinals of most remaining tournaments for the year. She split with Font de Mora in September 2006 and is currently coached by Dirk Dier.Her run of bad form continued into 2007, and as of June 19, Grönefeld has been eliminated in the first round of her last five tournaments.
