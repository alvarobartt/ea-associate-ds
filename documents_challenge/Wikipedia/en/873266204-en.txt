Écija was known as Augusta Firma Astigi. Astigi was an important town of Hispania Baetica, and the seat of one of the four conventi where the chief men met together at major centers, at fixed times of year, under the eye of the proconsul, to oversee the administration of justice, was also an early seat of a diocese; St. Fulgentius, bishop of Astigi (died before 633), was named to the see by his brother Isidore of Seville. Though it was suppressed in 1144, Astigi remains a titular see in the Roman Catholic Church http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d4a04.html.Although Astigi was one of the largest and most complete Roman cities ever to be unearthed, in 1998, mayor Julian Álvarez Pernía decided to bulldoze Écija's Roman ruins and replace them with a 299-car parking lot.Écija is known in Spain as "La sartén de España" (Spain's frying pan) because it records the highest summer temperatures in the nation.ReferencesAstigi RomanaBishops of Astigi: listCatholic Hierarchy: Astigi (titular see)External linksTurismo Écija, in English.EcijaWeb, in Spanish.Ecijaca:Écija de:Écija es:Écija fr:Écija gl:Écixa - Écija it:Écija nl:Écija pl:Écija pt:Écija ro:Écija ru:Эсиха tr:Écija
