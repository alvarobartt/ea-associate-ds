                            Stefania Belmondo (born January 13, 1969) is an Italian former cross-country skier.BiographyBelmondo was born in Vinadio, in the province of Cuneo (Piedmont), the daughter of a housewife and an electric company employee.DebutShe started to ski at the age of three in the Piedmontese mountains of her native city. She made her debut at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1987. The next season she joined the main national team of Italy, and then participated at the 1988 Winter Olympics, held in Calgary, Canada. In 1989, she won a World Cup event for her first time, in Salt Lake City, and ended that season second overall.Early success, injury, return, and later successesAt the 1991 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, she won a bronze medal in the 15&nbsp;km trial, and a silver in the 4 × 5&nbsp;km. The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville brought the first gold medal for Belmondo, in the 30&nbsp;km specialty. At the 1993 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, she won golds in the 5&nbsp;km + 10&nbsp;km combined pursuit and the 30&nbsp;km, and a silver in the 4 × 5&nbsp;km before an injury to her right hallux required a surgery, and caused a 4 month absence from competition.After a second operation, Belmondo participated to the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, gaining just two bronze medals; after this disappointing performance she decided to continue skiing, against the advice of her physician. The 1996-97 season was one of her best since the surgeries, when she won four silver medals (5&nbsp;km, 5&nbsp;km + 10&nbsp;km combined pursuit, 15&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km), all were behind Russian Yelena Välbe. In the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, she won a third place with the 4 × 5&nbsp;km, and an individual silver in the 30&nbsp;km. The bronze medal in the relay was remarkable because the Italian team was 9th as Belmondo started her anchor leg. The 1999 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships saw Stefania Belmondo win two gold medals (5&nbsp;km + 10&nbsp;km combined pursuit, 15&nbsp;km) and a silver (4 × 5&nbsp;km).In her final year of competition, 2002, she won a gold medal, as well as a silver, in the Winter Olympics. She concluded that year's World Cup in third place.Other career successesBelmondo also found success at the Holmenkollen ski festival, winning the 30&nbsp;km women's event twice (1997, 2002).As of 2008, she is the only woman to ever win the 30&nbsp;km Olympic, World Championship, and Holmenkollen events.Belmondo earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1997 (shared with Bjarte Engen Vik and Bjørn Dæhlie).2006 Winter OlympicsAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, in her native region of Piedmont, she lit the Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony.
