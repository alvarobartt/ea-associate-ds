at Rock in Rio (1985)]]Rock in Rio, the largest rock festival in the world (1.5 million people in the first edition, 700 thousand in the second, about 1 million in the third, and in the 3 international editions so far, all in Lisbon, each received about 350 thousand people), is a series of rock festivals held in Brazil and later in Portugal. Three incarnations of the festival were in Rio de Janeiro, in 1985, 1991 and 2001 and three in Lisbon, in 2004, 2006 and 2008. The shows were organized by entrepreneur Roberto Medina. And also in Madrid (Spain in 2008.Rock in RioThe first edition of the festival was held from January 11-20, 1985. Queen, George Benson, Rod Stewart, AC/DC and Yes were the headliners, each occupying top spot for two nights (Benson, however, ceded it to James Taylor for their second night in the same bill, due to the huge delay Taylor's extended performance had caused to his concert two days before). About 1.4 million people attended the 10-day-long festival.Rock in Rio in numbers:The "city of rock", the place were the event was held (which was built for the festival) covered an area of 250.000 m2 (around 2.7 million feet2)1.600.000 liters of beverages were served, using 4 million plastic cups.900.000 hamburgers.500.000 pizza slices.Mc Donalds sold 58.000 hamburgers in a single day, which was a Guinness World RecordThe full list of acts who performed at Rock in Rio: International Artists Brazilian Artists AC/DCAl JarreauThe B-52'sGeorge BensonThe Go-Go'sIron MaidenJames TaylorNina HagenOzzy OsbourneQueenRod StewartScorpionsWhitesnakeYes Alceu ValençaBaby Consuelo & Pepeu GomesBarão VermelhoBlitzEduardo DusekElba RamalhoErasmo CarlosGilberto GilIvan LinsKid AbelhaLulu SantosMoraes MoreiraNey MatogrossoParalamas do SucessoRita Lee  Both Queen shows were filmed (on January 11 and January 18) and broadcast throughout Brazil by Globo. Each show was watched by nearly 200 million people in over 60 countries. It was later broadcast in the United States on MTV as "Queen: Rock in Rio."Iron Maiden's own performance began at exactly two minutes to midnight. This was in celebration and promotion of their latest release, Powerslave, which featured the song 2 Minutes to Midnight. A widely known event occurred during the song "Revelations", when lead singer Bruce Dickinson, playing the guitar, threw his instrument up in the air, which proceeded to hit him on the forehead, opening a deep cut and soaking his face with blood. Dickinson went on as if nothing had happened. The British group was the only non-Brazilian act to play just one concert at the festival (at its opening night, headlined by Queen), since they were already booked for the days ahead and couldn't stay in Rio for longer. All the other international acts performed twice.The Go-Go's broke up after their two Rock in Rio performances, though they would later reunite in the 1990s. The two Rock in Rio shows were the debut and swansong for short-tenured Go-Go's member Paula Jean Brown, who had replaced Jane Wiedlin. (Wiedlin would return to the reunited 1990s lineup.)Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, at the time Talking Heads drummer and bass player, respectively, took part at the B-52's' concert. They joined the band from the third song on and played along with them for the remainder of the performance.Nina Hagen was paid nothing for her two performances, since she had approached Roberto Medina, the festival's mentor herself, requesting a place in its bill. Queen were the highest-paid act, commanding US$ 600,000 for its two headlining performances, on January 11 and 18.Initially, Def Leppard were scoped to join the festival. However, they dropped out about two months before the event, due to delays on the recording process of the album that came to be Hysteria. They were replaced by Whitesnake. The situation's turnaround would prove sadly fortunate for the festival's organizers, as Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen suffered the famous accident that cost him his left arm on New Year's Eve, a mere 11 days before the beginning of the festival.There's a video on YouTube of Os Paralamas do Sucesso lead singer Herbert Vianna advising the crowd to attend only to the performances of the artists they enjoy. Vianna said that because rocks were thrown on the stage during Kid Abelha's performance on the event a day earlier. Around that time, Kid Abelha's lead singer Paula Toller was reportedly Vianna's love interest. http://youtube.com/watch?v=iG_qfoT2GroRock in Rio 2The second edition was held from January 18-27, 1991 at the Maracanã stadium. Headliners were Guns N' Roses, Prince and George Michael, each being top billed for two of the event's nine nights.

The profits from the sale of the album were donated to the Clive Burr fund, which would help the former drummer pay mounting medical bills for treatment of his multiple sclerosis.Another notable appearance at Rock in Rio 3 was that of American hard-rock band Guns N' Roses, with a new line-up featuring guitarist Buckethead, original member Axl Rose (vocals), and longtime member Dizzy Reed (keyboards). Nick Oliveri, the bass player for Queens of the Stone Age performed in the nude for part of their set and was arrested for indecent exposure after the concert.

The decision to maintain the name Rock in Rio was controversial, and detractors of the idea in Brazil started calling it Rock in Rio Tejo http://www.planetanews.com/news/2004/10217 http://peixenarede.blogspot.com/2006/03/rock-in-rio-s-se-for-rio-tejo.html, after the Tagus (Tejo in Portuguese) river (rio, in Portuguese) which runs through the Portuguese capital. The first edition of Rock in Rio Lisboa, as the festival was officially called, took place in 2004. Although the festival had a slight change of name, it kept the same structure as the Brazilian editions. An entire City of Rock, with an area of over 200,000 m² was erected at the Bela Vista park, with a large centre stage and several tents where different artists would perform, simultaneously.ArtistsThe Fšÿ BandPaul McCartneyGilberto GilRui VelosoJetBen HarperPeter GabrielSeetherXutos e PontapésCharlie Brown Jr.Kings Of LeonEvanescenceFoo FightersMoonspellSepulturaSlipknotIncubusMetallicaNuno NorteJoão Pedro PaisSugababesBritney SpearsThe Black Eyed PeasDaniela MercuryLuís RepresasIvete SangaloAlejandro SanzAlicia KeysStingPedro Abrunhosain Rock in Rio Lisbon]]Rock in Rio Lisboa 2The second edition of Rock in Rio Lisboa was held in 2006, on 26/27 May and 2/3/4 June.ArtistsKill The YoungShakiraJamiroquaiIvete SangaloD'ZRTGuns N' RosesThe DarknessXutos e PontapésPittyRoger WatersCarlos SantanaRui VelosoJota QuestRed Hot Chili PeppersDa WeaselKasabianOrishasStingAnastaciaCorinne Bailey RaeMarcelo D2Rock In Rio Lisboa &amp; Madrid (2008)The third edition of Rock in Rio is taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, May 30-31 and June 1-5-6 and will be taking place in Arganda del Rey, Madrid, on the June 27-28 and July 4-5-6 in Madrid.Rock In Rio LisbonMay 30James Morrison (canceled)Paulo GonzoIvete SangaloAmy WinehouseLenny Kravitz (and Daniel R.)May 31SkankAlanis MorissetteAlejandro SanzBon JoviJune 1DocemaniaJust Girls4 TasteXutos &amp; PontapésTokio HotelJoss StoneRod StewartJune 5MetallicaMachine HeadApocalypticaMoonspellJune 6Linkin ParkThe OffspringMuseKaiser ChiefsOrishasConfirmed artists at Rock In Rio MadridJune 27Alanis MorissetteJack JohnsonManolo GarcíaNeil YoungJune 28Mando DiaoEl Canto Del LocoTokio HotelCarlinhos BrownJuly 4ShakiraJamiroquaiAmy WinehouseJames MorrisonJuly 5The PoliceAlejandro SanzEstopaIvete SangaloJuly 6Lenny KravitzFranz FerdinandChris CornellTiëstoExternal linksOfficial Rock in Rio Lisboa websiteOfficial Rock in Rio Madrid websiteVideos from the 2006 edition of Rock in Rio LisboaCategory:Music festivals Category:Rock festivals Category:Brazilian rockcs:Rock in Rio de:Rock in Rio es:Rock in Rio fr:Rock in Rio Lisbonne it:Rock in Rio he:רוק בריו nl:Rock in Rio (festival) no:Rock in Rio pl:Rock in Rio (festiwal) pt:Rock in Rio fi:Rock in Rio sv:Rock in Rio
