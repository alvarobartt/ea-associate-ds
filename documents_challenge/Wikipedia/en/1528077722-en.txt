He beat Alex Zanardi in the final round of the 1990 Italian Formula 3 Championship. In 1991 he won four races in a row, but was disqualified after a technicality concerning his tyres. For 1992 he was offered a ride in Team Crypton for the F3000 Championship, in which he emerged as champion.His debut Formula One season in  was mired by Scuderia Italia's uncompetitive Lola chassis, which, despite Ferrari engines, was the slowest car in the championship in terms of qualifying pace. He regularly beat his experienced team-mate Michele Alboreto, but lost out to him for the second drive when Scuderia Italia merged with Minardi for the  season. He was retained as test driver however, and took over the drive in  when Alboreto retired. In the underfunded team his best results were eighth places in Canada and Hungary and ninth in Japan. In  he switched to Forti Corse, where he was only able to qualify for six of the ten races the team entered, which folded after that year's British Grand Prix.at the Circuit de Catalunya in 2008.]]In 1997 Badoer began his long spell as Ferrari's test driver, a role he continues to perform. He returned to racing for one season in , with the Minardi team. In the July of that season, Ferrari's number one driver Michael Schumacher broke his leg in an accident at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. As Ferrari's test driver, Badoer expected to be promoted to the race seat in Schumacher's absence, but the team opted for Mika Salo instead, prompting criticism from former Ferrari driver Jean Alesi.Badoer holds the dubious distinction of being the driver who has competed in the most Grands Prix (48) without scoring a single point. He nearly achieved his first points finish in the 1999 European Grand Prix when a strong drive saw Badoer lying in 4th place with only 13 laps remaining. Unfortunately the gearbox on his Minardi subsequently failed and television cameras showed Badoer weeping by his stricken car.Badoer was unable to find a satisfactory race seat in Formula One after 1999, and he became a permanent test driver for Ferrari. He covers thousands of kilometres at the Mugello and Fiorano test circuits each year and it is likely that Badoer has driven more kilometres in a Ferrari F1 car than any other Italian in history.At the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Badoer demonstrated one of the team's 2005 cars in the centre of the stadium, revving the engine, and performing several doughnuts, creating a large cloud of tyre smoke, and leaving circular black marks on the white platform. The event was witnessed by millions of television viewers worldwide.Complete Formula One results(key)YearEntrantChassisEngine1234567891011121314151617WDCPoints1993]]Lola BMS Scuderia Italia]]Lola]] T93/30Ferrari]] V12RSARetBRA12EURDNQSMR7ESPRetMONDNQCAN15FRARetGBRRetGERRetHUNRetBEL13ITA10POR14JPN]]AUS]]-01995]]Minardi Scuderia Italia]]M195]]Ford]] V8BRARetARGDNSSMR14ESPRetMONRetCAN8FRA13GBR10GERRetHUN8BELRetITARetPOR14EUR11PAC15JPN9AUSDNS-01996Forti Grand PrixFG01B]]Ford V8AUSDNQBRA11ARGRetEURDNQ-0FG03]]SMR10MONRetESPDNQCANRetFRARetGBRDNQGER]]HUN]]BEL]]ITA]]POR]]JPN]]1999]]Minardi Ford]]M01]]Ford]] V10AUSRetBRA]]InjSMR8MONRetESPRetCAN10FRA10GBRRetAUT13GER10HUN14BELRetITARetEURRetMALRetJPNRet-0External linksLuca Badoer Official Site Olympic Doughuts videoProfile on F1 Rejects     Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Treviso Category:Italian racecar drivers Category:Italian Formula One drivers Category:Italian Formula Three Championship drivers Category:International Formula 3000 Champions Category:Minardi Formula One driversde:Luca Badoer et:Luca Badoer es:Luca Badoer fr:Luca Badoer id:Luca Badoer it:Luca Badoer lt:Luca Badoer lv:Luka Badoers hu:Luca Badoer nl:Luca Badoer ja:ルカ・バドエル pl:Luca Badoer pt:Luca Badoer ro:Luca Badoer ru:Бадоер, Лука sl:Luca Badoer fi:Luca Badoer sv:Luca Badoer
