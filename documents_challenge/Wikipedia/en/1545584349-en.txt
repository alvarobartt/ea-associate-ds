, and other outlying islands.]]The Bounty Islands at   are a small group of 13 granite islets and numerous rocks, with a combined area of 135 ha, in the south Pacific Ocean which are territorially part of New Zealand. They are located between 47°44'35" and 47°46'10" S, and 179°01' and 179°04'20" E, 650 km southeast of the South Island of New Zealand. Ecologically, they are part of the Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion. The group is uninhabited by humans, but heavily populated by penguins and albatrosses. During the 19th century, it was a popular hunting ground for sealers.The whole chain is only 5 km across at its longest axis, and comprises three subgroups, the by far largest Main Group to the NW, the Centre Group and the East Group. The total area is only 1.35 km2, and the highest point is 73 metres above sea level, on Funnel Island. Bounty Islands were discovered by Captain William Bligh in 1788 and named after his ship, just months before the infamous mutiny.The islands are inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage list together with the other sub-antarctic New Zealand islands in the region as follows: 877-002 Bounty Islands New Zealand S47 45 E179 03 135 Ha 1998The 13 islandsMain Group ():Depot Island (largest in the group)Lion IslandPenguin IslandProclamation IslandRanfurly IslandRuatara IslandSpider IslandTunnel IslandCentre Group ():Castle IslandFunnel Island (main islet)Prion IslandEast Group ():Molly Cap (main islet)North RockThe islands are at the antipodes of Bouillé-Ménard, in France (Pays-de-la-Loire).Category:Sub-Antarctic islands Category:New Zealand outlying islands Category:Uninhabited islands de:Bountyinseln es:Islas Bounty fr:Îles Bounty gl:Illas Bounty it:Isole Bounty he:איי באונטי lt:Baunčio salos nl:Bounty-eilanden ja:バウンティ諸島 pl:Bounty (wyspy) ru:Острова Баунти fi:Bountysaaret sv:Bountyöarna zh:邦蒂群岛
