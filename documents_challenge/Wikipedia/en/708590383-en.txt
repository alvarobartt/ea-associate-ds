  Ajattara is a five-piece black metal band from Helsinki, Finland. They formed in 1996 and are still active. They are signed to Spinefarm Records and have released five albums, their most recent being Kalmanto, which was released in September 2007.OverviewBrief historyAjattarra formed in 1996. Their first release was a demo tape entitled Helvetissä On Syntisen Taivas which was released in 1998. The band then signed to Spikefarm Records and went on to release three albums - Itse in 2001, Kuolema in 2003 and Tyhjyys. These albums were met with largely good reviews. Ajattara then went onto release a "Christmas Single" in the Novembers of 2004 and 2005, which is a tradition they have done for the last three years. They were entitled Ilon Juhla (2004) and Joulu (2005). The band then went onto release another album in 2006, entitled Äpäre, which was met with similar reviews as their last three albums. The band continued with the christmass single tradition of 2004 and 2005 by releasing a single entitled Sika in 2006.At the end of 2006 Ajattara's long time group broke up, when Pasi Koskinen made neo-nazi salutes and other same related political statements during a concert. Ajattara then reformated with a new line up some time during 2007. The band entered the studio on June 1 2007 to begin recording on the album Kalmanto which was released in September 5 2007. However, this album was not met with such good reviews as Ajattara's other albums, as some critics said the album sounded chaotic and forced.Musical styleAjattara combine elements of black metal and doom metal to play a style of black metal not dissimilar to Celtic Frost and to a lesser extent Samael. The combined use of synthesisers and heavy guitar sounds give Ajattara a distinct "grimey" sound. The lyrical themes of Ajattara usually deal with death, evil and paganism.MembersCurrent membersPasi Koskinen - vocals, guitarVesa Wahlroos - guitar, vocalsJuha Harju - bass, vocalsJanne Immonen - keyboardsTommi Lillman - drumsFormer membersToni Laroma - bassAtte Sarkima - drumsKalle Sundström - keyboardsTomi Koivusaari - guitarPekka Sauvolainen - drumsJan Rechberger - drumsAki Räty - keyboardsJarmo Ikala - keyboardsDiscographyAlbumsItse (2001)Kuolema (2003)Tyhjyys (2004)Äpäre (2006)Kalmanto (2007)DemosHelvetissä On Syntisen Taivas (1998)SinglesIlon Juhla (2004)Joulu (2005)Sika (2006)Tulppaani (2007)External linksAjattara's official websiteAjattara's page on Spinefarm RecordsAjattara's page on MySpaceAjattara's page on the All Music GuideAjattara's page on the Encyclopedia MetallumAjattara's page at Last.fmCategory:Finnish black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1996de:Ajattara et:Ajattara es:Ajattara fr:Ajattara (groupe) it:Ajattara nl:Ajattara no:Ajattara pl:Ajattara ro:Ajattara ru:Ajattara fi:Ajattara (yhtye) sv:Ajattara
