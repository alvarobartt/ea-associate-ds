Michael Strogoff: The Courier of the Czar () is a novel written by Jules Verne in 1876. It is considered one of Verne's best books by critics. Unlike some of Verne's other famous novels, it is not science fiction, but a scientific phenomenon is a plot device.The book has been adapted several times for films and cartoon series.Plot summaryMichael Strogoff is a courier for the czar Alexander II of Russia. When the Tatar king Feofar Khan invades Russia, Strogoff is sent to Irkutsk to warn the governor, who is the brother of the czar, against the traitor Ivan Ogareff. On his way he meets Nadia Fedor (in some translations, Nadia) and the war reporters Harry Blount -- reporting for an English paper -- and Alcide Jolivet, a Frenchman -- reporting for his 'cousin Madelaine'. Blount and Jolivet tend to follow the same route as Michael, separating and meeting again all the way through Siberia. Michael, his mother and Nadia are eventually taken prisoner by the Tartar forces. Ivan Ogareff says that Michael is a spy. Feofar, after consulting the Koran, decides that Michael will be blinded in the Tartar fashion, with a hot blade. Michael and Nadia escape, and travel to Irkutsk with a friendly peasant. They are delayed by fire and the frozen river. However, they eventually reach Irkutsk, and warn the Czar's brother in time of Ivan Ogareff. Michael's mother joins them and Michael and Nadia are married.External links[http://jv.gilead.org.il/morlock/strogoff/ Michael Strogoff - A play in Five Acts and Sixteen Scenes] from JV.Gilead.org.ilFree download in Microsoft Reader formatCategory:1876 novels Category:Novels by Jules Verne Category:Russia in fictionbr:Michel Strogoff cs:Carův kurýr de:Der Kurier des Zaren es:Miguel Strogoff fr:Michel Strogoff (roman) io:Michel Strogoff it:Michele Strogoff he:מיכאל סטרוגוב nl:Michael Strogoff, de koerier van de tsaar no:Tsarens kurér pl:Michał Strogow pt:Michel Strogoff ru:Михаил Строгов (роман) sv:Tsarens kurir
