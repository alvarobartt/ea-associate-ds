He is the only driver to posthumously win the Formula One World Drivers' Championship (in ), after being killed in practice for the Italian Grand Prix. Away from Formula One Rindt was highly successful in other single-seat formulae, as well as sports car racing. In  he won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, driving a Ferrari 250LM in partnership with American Masten Gregory.BiographyT77 at the 1965 German Grand Prix.]]  F2 car at the Nürburgring in 1970.]]Jochen Rindt was born in Mainz, Germany, but after his parents were killed in a bombing raid in Hamburg during the Second World WarNur auf der Rennstrecke sterblich&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;, he moved to live with his grandparents in Graz, Austria, where he grew up and started motor racing.Despite being very successful in Formula 2 (by winning for instance the 1964 London Trophy), Rindt kept on choosing the wrong F1 cars. Rindt made his Formula One debut for Rob Walker Racing Team in the 1964 Austrian Grand Prix. It was to be his only Grand Prix of the year. From 1965 to 1967, Rindt raced for Cooper Car Company, scoring 32 points in 29 races. In 1968, Rindt raced for Brabham, but Rindt's season wasn't what he had hoped for, due to technical problems. Rindt also raced in the Indianapolis 500 in both 1967 and 1968, but finished no better than 24th. Rindt was noted for being an exceptionally fast driver with superb car control and reflexes, but rarely had a car equal of his talent until 1969 when Rindt moved to Lotus and it was with Lotus that Rindt's career took off. Rindt clinched the first Grand Prix victory of his career in the Grand Prix of the USA in Watkins Glen. Rindt finished that year with 22 points, giving him fourth place in the World Drivers' Championship. Rindt occasionally had a fraught relationship with Colin Chapman as he preferred a stable technological footing as opposed to Chapman's need to innovate and invent, but the two forged a successful partnership. Rindt's 1970 season started with a dramatic last corner win at Monaco. Thereafter armed with perhaps the greatest Formula one car of all time, the Lotus 72, Rindt won four more Grands Prix in The Netherlands, France, Britain and Germany that year.During practice for the 1970 Italian Grand Prix in Monza, near Milan, Chapman and Rindt agreed to follow the lead of Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell) and Denny Hulme (McLaren) and run without wings in an attempt to reduce drag and gain a higher top speed. The more powerful Ferraris had been up to 10&nbsp;mph faster than the Lotus at the previous race in Austria. Rindt's team mate John Miles was unhappy with the wingless setup in Friday practice, reporting that the car 'wouldn't run straight'. Rindt reported no such problems, and Chapman recalled that Rindt reported the car to be 'almost 800&nbsp;rpm faster on the straight' without wings.Prüller (1970) pp.192&mdash;193On the following day, Rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of the reduced drag, increasing the cars' potential top speed to 205&nbsp;mph.Prüller (1970) p.195 On Rindt's fifth lap of the final practice session, Hulme, who was following, reported that under braking for the Parabolica corner: 'Jochen's car weaved slightly and then swerved sharp left into the crash barrier.' Prüller (1970) p.199 A joint in the crash barrier parted, the suspension dug in under the barrier and the car hit a stanchion head on. The front end of the car was destroyed. Although Rindt was rushed to hospital, he was pronounced dead. Rindt had only recently acquiesced to wearing a simple lap belt, and had slid underneath where the belt buckle cut his throat. He was the second Lotus team leader to be killed in two years, as Jim Clark had been killed in 1968. An Italian court later found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car's right front brakeshaft, but that Rindt's death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.Nye (1986) p.69Rindt is buried at the central cemetery (Zentralfriedhof) in Graz.At the time he died Rindt had won five of that year's ten Grands Prix, which meant that he had a strong lead in the World Drivers Championship. At that stage he theoretically could have been overtaken by Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx. However Rindt's Lotus team mate, Emerson Fittipaldi, won the penultimate Grand Prix of the year at Watkins Glen, depriving Ickx of the points he needed to win the title, and so Rindt became motor racing's first posthumous World Champion. The trophy was presented to his Finnish widow Nina Rindt nee Lincoln, daughter of famous Finnish racer, Curt Lincoln. In a tragic twist of irony, it was learned that Jochen had promised Nina he would retire from F1 if he won the world championship.Complete World Championship Formula One results(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap)YearEntrantChassisEngine12345678910111213WDCPoints1964]]Rob Walker Racing TeamBT11]]BRM]] V8MON]]NED]]BEL]]FRA]]GBR]]GER]]AUTRetITA]]USA]]MEX]]-01965Cooper Car CompanyCooper]] T73Climax]] V8RSARet13th4Cooper]] T77Climax]] V8MONDNQBEL11FRARetGBR14NEDRetGER4ITA'''8USA 6MEXRet1966]]Cooper Car CompanyCooper]] T81Maserati V12MONRetBEL2FRA4GBR5NEDRetGER3ITA4USA2MEXRet3rd22 (24)1967Cooper Car CompanyCooper]] T81Maserati V12RSARetMONRetCANRet13th6Cooper]] T81BMaserati V12NEDRetBEL4FRARetUSARetMEX]]Cooper]] T86Maserati V12GBRRetGERRetITA41968Brabham Racing OrganisationBT24]]Repco V8RSA3ESPRetMONRet12th8BT26]]Repco V8BELRetNEDRetFRARetGBRRetGER3ITA RetCANRetUSARetMEXRet1969]]Gold Leaf]] Team LotusLotus]] 49BFord V8RSARetESPRetMON]]NEDRetFRARetGBR4GERRetITA2CAN3USA1MEXRet4th221970Gold Leaf Team LotusLotus]] 49CFord V8RSA13MON1BELRet1st45Lotus]] 72Ford V8ESPRetLotus]] 72CFord V8NED1FRA1GBR1GER1AUTRetITADNSCAN]]USA]] MEX]]NotesReferencesExternal linksGrand Prix History - Hall of Fame, Jochen RindtJochen Rindt statisticsJochen Rindt Photos       Category:1942 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Austrian racecar drivers Category:Austrian Formula One drivers Category:Lotus Formula One drivers Category:Indy 500 drivers Category:Racecar drivers killed while racing Category:Monaco Grand Prix winners Category:Sport deaths in Italy Category:Filmed deaths in sportsbg:Йохен Ринт ca:Jochen Rindt cs:Jochen Rindt da:Jochen Rindt de:Jochen Rindt es:Jochen Rindt fr:Jochen Rindt hr:Jochen Rindt it:Jochen Rindt lv:Johens Rints hu:Jochen Rindt nl:Jochen Rindt ja:ヨッヘン・リント pl:Jochen Rindt pt:Jochen Rindt ro:Jochen Rindt ru:Риндт, Йохен simple:Jochen Rindt sl:Jochen Rindt sr:Johen Rint fi:Jochen Rindt sv:Jochen Rindt uk:Ріндт Йохен
