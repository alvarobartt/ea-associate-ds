It was adopted in 1991, replacing Preamble, the anthem in use since independence in 1979. The melody is that of the German student song "Ich hab' mich ergeben" (which was also one of the unofficial anthems of West Germany between 1949 and 1952). The lyrics are also loosely based on a translation of the song.TextTis here we are pledging,with heart and with hand,Full measure of devotionto thee, our native land,Full measure of devotionto thee, our native land.Now all join the chorus,let union abide.Across all Micronesiajoin hands on every side,Across all Micronesiajoin hands on every side.We all work together,with hearts, voice and hand,Till we have made these islandsanother promised land,Till we have made these islandsanother promised land.External links[http://www.navyband.navy.mil/anthems/ANTHEMS/Micronesia.mp3 Patriots of Micronesia (instrumental, mp3)]Listen to the Micronesia Anthem(ASF FILE)Sound file (mp3): Ich hab' mich ergebenCategory:National anthems Category:Music of the Federated States of Micronesia Category:National symbols of the Federated States of Micronesiade:Patriots of Micronesia es:Patriots of Micronesia fr:Patriots of Micronesia ko:미크로네시아 연방의 국가 jv:Patriots of Micronesia nl:Patriots of Micronesia pl:Hymn Mikronezji pt:Hino nacional da Micronésia ru:Гимн Федеративных Штатов Микронезии fi:Patriots of Micronesia
