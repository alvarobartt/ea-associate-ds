 County Westmeath () is a county situated in the Irish midlands, also popularly called the "Lake county" in the western part of the province of Leinster. Area: 1,764 km². The county was once part of the ancient province of Meath and later of County Meath.

Athlone, Moate, Kilbeggan, and Castlepollard are also important commerce and marketing centres within the county.After the famine the population of Westmeath dropped dramatically, and didn't recover until the late 1950s.EconomyWestmeath has traditionally been an agricultural economy. Urban development centred on market centres like Mullingar, Moate, and Kinnegad. Athlone developed due to its critical military significance in the 1500s, as it was located where the main East-West route crossed the Shannon. Mullingar got considerable advantage from the development of the Royal Canal making possible bulk transport to Dublin, and the sea. Both Athlone and Mullingar developed further in significance with the construction of the Irish railway network.Tourism in Westmeath is centred on its water amenities. The county has lakes such as Lough Derravaragh, Lough Ennell, Lough Lene, Lough Owel and Lough Ree. Both the Grand Canal, and the Royal Canal go through Westmeath, and the Shannon (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a considerable inland harbour in Athlone.The development of industry in Westmeath was based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey production in Kilbeggan, tobacco processing in Mullingar, and the meat trade were prominent. In recent times, the drug company élan has located in Athlone. The district to the East of Mullingar is now part of the commuter belt serving the technology parks on the western side of Dublin, proving popular with people who wish to work in Leixlip, County Kildare.InfrastructureMidlands (ATM) GatewayNational Development PlanTransport 21Platform 11AgricultureWestmeath cattleMullingar Cattle are farmed for their high quality beef, veal, fattened upon the plains of Meath and Westmeath. Much of the country's weaned cattle, in particular, cattle from west of the Shannon, west of Athlone, arrive upon the Westmeath and Meath grasslands, for final fattening before they are conditioned for human consumption. This is also true to a lesser extent for other neighbouring counties, Cavan and Offaly pastures. These cattle are also employed to maintain grassland for wildlife for example, within the surrounding areas fringing the Bog of Allen. They are often used in some of the wildest places for livestock. Depending upon their breed, certain cattle are more suited to hill grazing, heaths, marshes, and moors.The Westmeath HorseWestmeath contains many stud farms. The rich plains of Westmeath, rich in calcium, marl contribute significantly to calcification of the foals bones during the formation years. Westmeath mares are put into foal preferably in spring so that the foal may grow through the summer, pregnancy lasts for approximately 335-340 days and usually results in one foal. When these Westmeath horses are about four years old, they are considered mature.PeopleNotable Westmeath people include:Michael O'Leary the CEO of RyanairJoe DolanBroadcaster Marian FinucaneNuala Holloway, artist and former Miss IrelandSportWestmeath's main achievements in Gaelic games were winning the Leinster Senior Football Championship, or Delaney Cup, in 2004, and winning the Christy Ring Cup in hurling in 2005 and 2007.See alsoList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Westmeath)ReferencesExternal linksWestmeath Census informationWestmeath Community DevelopmentSTRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE MIDLANDS GATEWAY; Census stastics page 27 Athlone Advertiser and Mullingar Advertiser local newspapersLocal job vacancy listings onlineWestmeath TourismWestmeath EnterpriseWestmeath Examiner (Local Newspaper)Tullamore Life &amp; CommunityWestmeath BandsArdnagrath National School WebsiteRosemount GAA WebsiteImages Image:Mullingar 01 area.JPG|Mapa Image:Canal Mullingar_01.JPG|Cosán tarraingthe canálaImage:Christ_le_Roi_Mullingar.JPG|Christ the King Mullingar Image:Castlepollard_01.JPG|The Round-about, Castlepollard Image:Moulin_%C3%A0_Pierre.jpg|An Muileann gCearr Image:Les_tours_Christ_le_Roi_Mullingar.jpg|Twin Towers, Christ the King Mullingar Image:SmallStPetersAthlone.jpg|Saint Peter's & Pauls Athlone Image:Austin_Friars_01.jpg|Austin Friars An Muileann gCearr Image:Mullingar_Centre.jpg|Bothar Mor Mullingar Centre Image:Canal_%C3%A0_Mullingar.jpg|The channel An Muileann gCearr Image:Celtic_Cross_Columb_Barracks_Mullingar.JPG|Celtic Cross at Columb  Military Barracks, Mullingar Image:Knockeyon_07.jpg|Lough Derravaragh & Knockeyon Image:Lough_ennell_ireland.png|Lough Ennell Image:Hill_of_Ben_Fore.JPG| Hill of Ben Fore Image:Plaque_de_la_caserne_Columb_Mullingar.JPG|Columb Baracks, Mullingar Image:Style.JPG|19th.
