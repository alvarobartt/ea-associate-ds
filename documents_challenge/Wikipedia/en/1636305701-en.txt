Founded by a merger in 1907, Venezia have spent a large part of their history bouncing between the top-two tiers of Italian football.The most notably trophy success in the history of Venezia, was winning the Coppa Italia during the 1940&ndash;41 season. The early 1940s was the pinnacle of the club's footballing prominence so far, as they also recorded their highest ever Serie A league finishing during that period with a 3rd place in 1941&amp;ndash;42.After getting into financially difficulties in recent years, the club are currently competing in Serie C1 for the 2007&amp;ndash;08 season. The original club going under the name Associazione Calcio Venezia 1907 was declared insolvent because of bankruptcy and relegated from Serie B in 2005.HistoryThe club was founded as Venezia Football Club on 14 December 1907, by members of two local sports clubs coming together; Palestra Marziale and Costantino Reyer. It was originally based at Campo San Bartolomeo in the city of Venice; fifteen men including the first president Davide Fano were involved in the club's founding;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent timesIn its history, Venezia has spent a large part of recent years bouncing between Italy's two top divisions (it was last relegated from Serie A in 2002). It was this last season in Serie A which signalled the beginning of the end for the old club. Frustrated with the team and the inability to agree plans for a larger stadium with the council, then President, Maurizio Zamparini, decided to purchase U.S. Città di Palermo, and took with him a large portion of the squad.Their stadium, the Pierluigi Penzo, is the only ground in Italy's top flights to which opposing teams and fans must get a boat to.Venezia won the Coppa Italia in 1941. That team contained some of the players who went on to form part of the Torino F.C. side of the 1940s who died in the Superga air disaster in 1949, such as Ezio Loik and Valentino Mazzola.Notable recent former players include Álvaro Recoba, Filippo Maniero and Christian Vieri.Players                            Notable former players   Augustine Ahinful Jimmy Algerino Daniel Andersson Can Bartu Runar Berg Joachim Björklund Mauro Bressan Igor Budan Kewullay Conteh Mario Cvitanović Marco Delvecchio Maurizio Ganz Pablo García Michael Konsel Nii Lamptey Federico Magallanes Rubén Maldonado Filippo Maniero Stefano Morrone Hiroshi Nanami Luis Oliveira Dejan Petković Álvaro Recoba Flavio Roma Simone Pavan Tomislav Rukavina Juan Santisteban Stefan Schwoch Michele Serena Andrea Silenzi Massimo Taibi William Viali Christian Vieri Colours, badge and nicknames  Originally Venezia's colours were red and blue and the shirt features halves in those colours, the kit was very similar to that of Genoa. However just a year after the club founded, it changed colours to black and green in 1908.Much later, in 1987 when the club merged with a local side Associazione Calcio Mestre from Mestre who wore orange and black, orange would also become one of Venezia's official colours, giving them the nickname arancioneroverdi ("orange-black-greens"). Venezia's colours and kit are very distinctive; the shirt, shorts and socks are usually black with the shirt having a green and orange trim.The symbol of the Venetian club is a winged-lion, commonly mistaken for a griffin. The golden winged-lion is the official symbol carries by the city of province of Venice; the symbol has led to one of the club's most popular nicknames in the form of leoni alati ("winged-lions").As the club has been renamed numerous times during its history, the badge has also changed several times; the most common one features the golden winged lion, along with the green and orange club colours with a golden border. As the city of Venice is situated on the Venetian Lagoon, the club is also nicknamed lagunari ("Lagoonal ones").HonoursCoppa Italia:Winners (1): 1940&ndash;41Serie B:Champions (2): 1960&ndash;61; 1965&ndash;66Runners-up (3): 1938&ndash;39; 1948&ndash;49; 1997&ndash;98Promoted (1): 2000&ndash;01Serie C / Serie C1:Champions (2): 1935&ndash;36; 1955&ndash;56Runners-up (1): 1990&ndash;91Serie C2:Champions (1): 2005&amp;ndash;06Runners-up (1): 1987&ndash;88Serie D:Promoted (1): 1982&ndash;83Runners-up (1): 1978&ndash;79ReferencesExternal linksVenezia's official websiteVenezia fan website updated regularlyUnione Venezia Calcio fan website updated regularlySatellite image of Venezia's ground from Google Maps   Category:S.S.C.
