                   () (born 26 January 1951 in Golčův Jeníkov) is a former late-developing Czech 400 m runner whose career was dogged by injury and illness. Always in the shadow of Marita Koch she hit peak form in 1983 aged 32. Entering a one-off 800 m in Munich reportedly as a training exercise, she broke the world record with 1:53.28. This convinced her to attempt an unlikely double in the inaugural World Championships 10 days later. Despite a seemingly impossible schedule, she won the 800 m easily and set a world record 47.99 to win the 400 m. Koch, having missed training through injury ran (and won) the 200 m. Though Koch beat her 400 m time in 1985, her 800 m record remains as one of the longest standing in Track and Field.Referencesprofile     Nadezhda Olizarenko|title=Women's 800 metres World Record Holder|years=1983-07-26 &mdash; |after=Incumbent   Marita Koch | | title=United Press International&lt;br&gt;Athlete of the Year | | after= Martina Navratilova | | years=1983  Marita Koch|after= Evelyn Ashford|years=1983   Doina Melinte|title=Women's 800 metres Best Year Performance|years=1983|after= Irina Podyalovskaya  Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Czech athletes Category:Czechoslovak athletes Category:Sprinters Category:Middle distance runners Category:World record holders Category:Olympic athletes of Czechoslovakia Category:Athletes at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for Czechoslovakiacs:Jarmila Kratochvílová de:Jarmila Kratochvílová et:Jarmila Kratochvílová es:Jarmila Kratochvílová fr:Jarmila Kratochvílová nl:Jarmila Kratochvílová ja:ヤルミラ・クラトフビロバ no:Jarmila Kratochvílová pl:Jarmila Kratochvílová sk:Jarmila Kratochvílová fi:Jarmila Kratochvílová sv:Jarmila Kratochvílová
