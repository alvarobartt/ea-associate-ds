 Swallowtail butterflies are large, colorful butterflies which form the family Papilionidae. There are at least 550 species, and though the majority are tropical, members of the family are found on all continents except Antarctica. The family includes the largest butterflies in the world, the birdwing butterflies of Australia (genus '' Ornithoptera''). Reed, Robert D. and Sperling, Felix A. H. 2006. Papilionidae. The Swallowtail Butterflies. Version 7 July 2006. http://tolweb.org/Papilionidae/12177/2006.07.07 in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/Swallowtails differ from all other butterflies in a number of anatomical traits. Most notably, their caterpillars possess a unique organ behind their heads, called the osmeterium. Normally hidden, this forked structure can be everted when the caterpillar is threatened, and emits smelly secretions containing terpenes. The adults are often tailed like the forked tail of some swallows, giving the insect its name.Classificationthoas]]The genera of extant swallowtails are usually classified into three subfamilies, Baroniinae, Parnassiinae and Papilioninae, the latter two being further divided into tribes. The tribes recognized are Baroniini, Parnassiini, Zerynthiini, Luehdorfiini, Leptocircinini, Teinopalpini, Troidiini and Papilioniini. An additional subfamily Praepapilioninae, has a single extinct member, and is known only from a single fossil.Durden, C.J., and H. Rose. 1978. Butterflies from the middle Eocene: the earliest occurrence of fossil Papilionidae (Lepidoptera). Pearce-Sellards Ser. Tex. Mem. Mus. 29: 1-25. A proposed phylogeny of the Papilionidae is given below:Reed, Robert D. and Sperling, Felix A. H. 2006. Papilionidae. The Swallowtail Butterflies.

A study found that the Papilios are monophyletic and old morphological classifications where also found to be valid in that they formed clusters. Species belonging to the groups that use Rutaceae as host plants formed two groups corresponding to Old World and American taxa. Those that fed on Lauraceae and Magnoliaceae were found to form another cluster which includes both Asian and American taxa.Aubert J, Legal L, Descimon H, Michel F. 1999 Molecular phylogeny of swallowtail butterflies of the tribe Papilionini (Papilionidae, Lepidoptera). Mol Phylogenet Evol.12(2):156-67 '', the largest Swallowtail in the Western Hemisphere]] '', The Black Swallowtail]] Swallowtail tribes Zerynthiini (Parnassiinae), Luehdorfiini (Parnassiinae) and Troidini (Papilioninae) almost exclusively use the Aristolochiaceae family as their host plants. Many species sequester aristolochic acids making them unpalatable, causing both the larval and adult stages to be unpalatable to predators.von Euw, J., T. Reichstein, and M. Rothschild. 1968. Aristolochic acid in the swallowtail butterfly Pachlioptera aristolochiae. Isr. J. Chem. 6: 659-670.The subfamily Baroniinae is represented by the sole representative species Baronia brevicornis. They are unique in the family to use the Fabaceae as their larval host plants.The Apollos, Parnassiinae, are a distinctive group and all species are alpine and capable of living at high altitudes. Most species have two small reddish spots on their hindwings. The genera Parnassius and Hypermnestra were found to be extremely close based on molecular studies.Katoh T, Chichvarkhin A, Yagi T, Omoto K. 2005 Phylogeny and evolution of butterflies of the genus Parnassius: inferences from mitochondrial 16S and ND1 sequences. Zoolog Sci.22(3):343-51 After mating, the male Parnassines produce a glue like substance that is used to seal the female genital opening and prevent other males from mating.The pupae are typically attached to the substrate attached by the cremaster but with head up held by a silk girdle. The apollos however pupate in debris on the ground and also build a loose cocoon. In the temperate regions the winters are passed in a pupal diapause stage.Swallowtails and Humans.]] Swallowtail butterflies, being large, colourful, and attractive, have been the target of butterfly collectors in earlier times. The largest of these, the Birdwing butterflies are particularly sought after and are cultured in butterfly farms for the purpose of collectors.Many members of the family feed as larvae on plants of the Citrus family Rutaceae. Some of these attractive butterflies are therefore considered pests in Citrus orchards.The Oregon Swallowtail Butterfly is the state insect of Oregon; the eastern tiger swallowtail is the state insect of Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Delaware. (See List of U.S. state butterflies)The Tiger Swallowtail is the state butterfly of Georgia.Notable species[[Image:Osmeterium.JPG|thumb|Second or third instar Papilio glaucus caterpillar showing osmeterium]]Anise swallowtail, Papilio zelicaonBlack swallowtail, Papilio polyxenesClouded apollo, Parnassius mnemosyneEastern tiger swallowtail, Papilio glaucusPipevine swallowtail, Battus philenorScarce swallowtail, Iphiclides podaliriusSpicebush swallowtail, Papilio troilusWestern Tiger swallowtail, Papilio rutulusOld World Swallowtail, Papilio machaonCitrus swallowtail, Papilio demodocusApollo butterfly, Parnasius apolloZebra Swallowtail, Eurytides marcellusNotable species in JapanAsian Swallowtail, Papilio xuthus Linnaeus, 1767.

Though her insect designation was never announced in Beetleborgs Metallix (her name being Ladyborg), the astral coin that was used to summon her has the illustration of a Swallowtail Butterfly.ReferencesExternal linksTree of Life Papilionidaerevised GloBIS/GART species checklistSwallowtail photosAfrotropical Kite SwallowtailsBBC News: &quot;LEDs work like butterflies' wings&quot;on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site[http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/bfly/zebra_swallowtail.htm Eurytides marcellus, zebra swallowtail][http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/bfly/schaus_swallowtail.htm Papilio aristodemus ponceanus, Schaus swallowtail][http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/bfly/tiger_swallowtail.htm Papilio glaucus, tiger swallowtail][http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/bfly/palamedes_swallowtail.htm Papilio palamedes, palamedes swallowtail]Category:Papilionidae Category:Insect familiescs:Otakárkovití da:Svalehaler de:Ritterfalter es:Papilionidae fr:Papilionidae fy:Paazjes ko:호랑나비과 it:Papilionidae ka:აფროსნისებრნი lt:Sklandūnai hu:Pillangófélék ml:കടുവാവരയന്‍ ഇരട്ടവാലന്‍ ചിത്രശലഭം nl:Pages (vlinders) ja:アゲハチョウ no:Svalestjerter pl:Paziowate pt:Papilionidae ro:Papilionidae ru:Парусники (бабочки) sk:Vidlochvostovité sr:Ластин репак fi:Ritariperhoset sv:Riddarfjärilar zh:凤蝶科
