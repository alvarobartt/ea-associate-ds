Protoscience refers to historical philosophical disciplines which existed prior to the development of scientific method, which allowed them to develop into science proper (see prescientific). A standard example is that of alchemy which later became chemistry, or that of astrology which later became astronomy.By extension, "protoscience" may be used in reference to any "set of beliefs or theories that have not yet been tested adequately by the scientific method but which are otherwise consistent with existing science, being a new science working to establish itself as legitimate science".Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition (v 0.9.7) Lexico Publishing Group, LLCHistory of the termThe philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn first used the word in an essay, originally published in 1970:List of examplesBabylonian astronomyHellenistic astronomyIndian astronomyVedantaAlchemyRenaissance magicSee alsoHistory of scienceHistory of science in early culturesScience in the Middle AgesHistory of science in the RenaissancePhilosophy of scienceMethodical culturalismFalsifiabilityConjectureHypothesisPathological scienceFringe scienceNatural magicPseudoscienceList of pseudoscientific theoriesObsolete scientific theoriesReferencesCitations and notesGeneral informationH Holcomb, Moving Beyond Just-So Stories: Evolutionary Psychology as Protoscience.
