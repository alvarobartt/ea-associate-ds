The Messier objects are a set of astronomical objects first listed by French astronomer Charles Messier in his "Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles" ("Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters") included in the Connaissance des Temps for 1774 (published in 1771). The original motivation of the catalogue was that Messier was a comet hunter, and was frustrated by objects which resembled but were not comets. He therefore compiled a list of these objects&lt;/ref&gt;, in collaboration with his assistant [[Pierre Méchain]].The first edition covered 45 objects numbered M1 to M45. The total list published by Messier finally contained 103 objects, but the list "got an independent life" by successive additions by other astronomers, motivating the additions by side notes in Messier's and Mechain's texts indicating that either of them new of the objects. The first such addition came from Camille Flammarion in 1921, who added Messier 104 after finding Messiers side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue. M105 to M107 were added by Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947, M108 and M109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960, and M110 by Kenneth Glyn JonesThe Guinness Book of Astronomy, Patrick Moore and Guinness Superlatives Ltd 1979, ISBN 09-00-42476-1. M102 cannot be positively identified; likely candidates are the galaxies M101 and NGC 5866.Messier's final catalogue was included in the Connaissance des Temps for 1784 (published in 1781). Many of these objects are still known by their Messier number.&lt;/ref&gt;Because Messier lived and did his astronomical work in France in the Northern Hemisphere, the list he compiled contains only objects from the north celestial pole to a celestial latitude of about –35.698342°. Many impressive Southern objects, such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are excluded from the list. Because all of the Messier objects are visible with binoculars or small telescopes (under favorable conditions), they are popular viewing objects for amateur astronomers. In early spring, astronomers sometimes gather for "Messier marathons", when all of the objects can be viewed over a single night.&lt;/ref&gt;See alsoList of Messier objectsMessier marathonCategory:Messier objectsDeep sky objectNew General CatalogueHerschel 400 CatalogueCaldwell catalogueReferencesExternal linksSEDS Messier DatabaseCharles MessierCharles Messier's Catalog of Nebulae and Star ClustersHistory of the Messier Cataloghttp://zebu.uoregon.edu/messier.htmlhttp://www.12dstring.me.uk/messiercatalogue.htmhttp://messier45.com/messier/index.htmlhttp://www.space-and-telescope.com/MessierObjects.aspx* Category:Astronomical cataloguesbg:Каталог на Месие ca:Catàleg Messier cs:Messierův katalog da:Messiers katalog de:Messier-Katalog el:Αντικείμενο Μεσιέ es:Catálogo Messier eo:Messier-katalogo eu:M sistema fr:Catalogue Messier ko:메시에 천체 hr:Messierov katalog it:Catalogo di Messier sw:Orodha ya Messier lv:Mesjē katalogs lb:Messier-Katalog lt:Mesjė objektas hu:Messier-katalógus ml:മെസ്സിയര്‍ വസ്തു ms:Objek Messier nl:Messierobject ja:メシエ天体 no:Messierobjekt nn:Messierkatalogen pl:Katalog Messiera pt:Catálogo Messier ro:Catalogul Messier ru:Каталог Мессье sk:Messierov katalóg sl:Messierov katalog fi:Messierin luettelo sv:Messiers katalog vi:Thiên thể Messier uk:Каталог Мессьє zh:梅西耶天體
