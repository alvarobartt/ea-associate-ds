He is affectionately referred to as "Lo zio" ("the uncle") because of the impressive moustache he wore even as an 18 year old in the 1982 World Cup. He thus appeared to be more mature in age than he was, hence the nickname. He is considered as one of the greatest defenders in the history of the game. He was also known as "Il Capitano" ("the captain").Bergomi made his Inter debut in the 1980/81 season, at the age of 17. The 19 seasons he spent with Inter were often spent in the shadow of A.C. Milan, as he only won the scudetto once: in 1989 (he did win the UEFA Cup on three occasions). With the national team, Bergomi won the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and also played in the 1986 and 1990 campaigns, as well as Euro 88. After being sent off in a match against Norway in a qualifier for Euro 92, Bergomi spent years without getting a callback to the Azzurri, but then received a surprise recall for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He retired in 1999 at the age of 36, after making 81 appearances for his country. He currently works as football pundit for Italian satellite television Sky Italia, and commented the Italy matches in the 2006 FIFA World Cup together with Fabio Caressa.Bergomi was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.Career statistics  |- |1979-80||rowspan="20"|Internazionale Milano||rowspan="20"|Serie A||0||0||1||0||colspan="2"|-||1||0 |- |1980-81||12||0||colspan="2"|-||4||0||16||0 |- |1981-82||24||2||10||2||4||0||38||4 |- |1982-83||28||1||9||1||6||0||43||2 |- |1983-84||25||0||5||0||5||0||35||0 |- |1984-85||29||2||9||0||10||0||48||2 |- |1985-86||30||5||6||0||10||0||46||5 |- |1986-87||28||2||9||0||8||0||45||2 |- |1987-88||28||1||9||0||5||0||42||1 |- |1988-89||32||1||8||0||6||0||46||1 |- |1989-90||33||2||4||0||2||0||39||2 |- |1990-91||30||3||4||1||12||0||46||4 |- |1991-92||29||0||6||0||2||0||37||0 |- |1992-93||31||2||6||0||colspan="2"|-||37||2 |- |1993-94||31||0||4||0||12||0||47||0 |- |1994-95||32||1||7||1||2||0||41||2 |- |1995-96||27||0||5||0||1||0||33||0 |- |1996-97||19||0||7||0||10||0||36||0 |- |1997-98||28||0||5||0||9||0||42||0 |- |1998-99||23||1||7||0||9||0||39||1 519||23||122||5||117||0||757||28 519||23||122||5||117||0||757||28 |HonorsCoppa Italia: 1982FIFA World Cup: 1982; Third place 1990Serie A: 1989Supercoppa Italiana: 1989UEFA Cup: 1991, 1994, 1998; Runner-up 1997See alsoOne-club man     Category:1963 births Category:1982 FIFA World Cup players Category:1986 FIFA World Cup players Category:1990 FIFA World Cup players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:F.C.
