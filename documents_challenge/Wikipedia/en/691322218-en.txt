Catarrhini is a parvorder of the Primates, one of the three major divisions of the suborder Haplorrhini. It contains the Old World monkeys (superfamily Cercopithecoidea, family Cercopithecidae) and the apes (superfamily Hominoidea). The latter is further divided into the lesser apes (family Hylobatidae), consisting of the gibbons; and the hominids or great apes (family Hominidae), consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. Older references described humans and their most close extinct relatives/ancestors as a family on its own and placed the great apes in the family Pongidae. The other two major divisions of the suborder Haplorrhini are the prosimian tarsiers, which were formerly classified with the strepsirrhines, and the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys), which live in both South America and Central America.Catarrhini means narrow nose, and the term describes their narrow, downward pointing nostrils. Unlike the platyrrhini, they are generally diurnal and their tails (if they have tails at all) are not prehensile. They have flat fingernails.Their dental formula is Most species show considerable sexual dimorphism and do not form a pair bond. Most, but not all, species live in social groups. They are all native to Africa and Asia.Classification and evolutionThe apes and Old World monkeys split from their New World monkey kin about 40 million years ago. The major catarrhine division occurred about 25 mya, with the gibbons separating from the great apes and humans about 18 mya.Parvorder CatarrhiniSuperfamily CercopithecoideaFamily Cercopithecidae: Old World monkeysSuperfamily HominoideaFamily Hylobatidae: gibbonsFamily Hominidae: great apes and humansReferencesExternal linkshttp://www.chimpanzoo.org/catarrhi.htmlCategory:Primatesca:Catarí da:Østaber de:Altweltaffen es:Catarrhini fa:راست‌بینیان fr:Catarrhini ko:협비원류 hr:Catarrhini it:Catarrhini he:קופים צרי אף ka:ცხვირვიწრო მაიმუნები hu:Keskenyorrú majmok nl:Smalneusapen ja:狭鼻下目 no:Østaper pl:Małpy wąskonose pt:Catarrhini ru:Узконосые обезьяны sv:Smalnäsor tr:Catarrhini zh:狹鼻小目
