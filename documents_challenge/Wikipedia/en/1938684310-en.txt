 The Centre Party (in Finnish: Suomen Keskusta, Kesk., in Swedish: Centern i Finland, C) is a centrist political party in Finland. It is one of the three largest political parties in the country, along with the Social Democrats (SDP) and the National Coalition Party. Currently the Centre Party has the most seats, 51 out of 200, in the Finnish Parliament (2007). Its political influence is greatest in small and rural municipalities, where it often holds a majority of the seats in the municipal councils. Decentralization is the policy that is most characteristic of the Centre Party.StanceThe party is a member of the Liberal International and the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and subscribes to the liberal manifestos of these organisations. Its members in the European Parliament are members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Despite belonging to the Liberal International, the Centre Party does not play quite the same role in Finnish politics as do Liberal parties in other countries because it evolved from an Agrarian Party. In Finland, there is no large party that supports liberalism per se. Instead, liberalism is found in all parties as well as in the Centre Party, which supports decentralization, free will, free and fair trade, and small enterprise.One of the major differences between the Finnish Centre and other parties has been its large number of members; hundreds of thousands of Finnish people are members of the party. In recent years, the party has gained many immigrant members as well.Throughout the period of Finland's independence the Centre Party has been the party most often represented in the government. The country's longest-serving president, Urho Kekkonen, was from the party.Today, only a small portion (about 5%) of the votes given to the party come from farmers and the Centre Party draws support from a wide range of professions. However, even today rural Finland and small towns form the strongest base of support for the party, although it has worked toward making a breakthrough in the major southern cities as well. The current Prime Minister of Finland is Matti Vanhanen, who succeeded Anneli Jäätteenmäki.HistoryThe party was founded in 1906 as a movement of citizens in the Finnish countryside. Before Finnish independence, political power in Finland was centralized in the capital and to the estates of the realm. The centralization gave space for a new political movement. In 1906 were founded two agrarian movements which in 1908 merged into one political party: the Agrarian League or Maalaisliitto.From the very beginning of its presence the party has supported the idea of decentralization. At the dawn of Finnish independence the party supported republicanism as opposed to a monarchy backed by conservative social forces.Soon the ideas of humanity, education, the spirit of the land, peasant-like freedom, decentralization, "the issue of poor people", progressivism, and later the "green wave" became the main political phrases describing the ideology of the party. Santeri Alkio was the most important ideological father of the party. In the 1930s centre forces led the fight against the threatening right-wing movement.In 1965 the party changed its name to "Centre Party" or Keskustapuolue and in 1988 it took its current name Suomen Keskusta. Today the importance of humanity and tolerance, social safety and freedom of choice, regional equality, entrepreneurship, ecologically sustainable initiatives, and a decentralised, democratic decision-making process are important values for the Centre Party.Prominent party leadersLauri Kristian Relander, President 1925-1931Kyösti Kallio, Prime Minister four times 1922-1937, President 1937-1940Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister twice 1950-1956, President 1956-1981Martti Miettunen, Prime Minister twice 1961-1977Ahti Karjalainen, Prime MinisterList of party ChairmenOtto Karhi 1906-1909Kyösti Kallio 1909-1917Filip Saalasti 1918Santeri Alkio 1918Petter Vilhelm Heikkinen 1919-1940Viljami Kalliokoski 1941-1945Vieno Johannes Sukselainen 1946-1964Johannes Virolainen 1965-1980 - Prime Minister, Speaker of ParliamentPaavo Väyrynen 1980-1990 - Foreign Minister, Member of the European parliamentEsko Aho 1990-2000, 2001-2002 - Prime Minister 1991-1995Anneli Jäätteenmäki 2000-2001, 2002-2003 - Speaker of Parliament, Prime Minister 2003Matti Vanhanen 2003 - Prime MinisterSee alsoLiberalism and centrism in FinlandExternal links Official website Official website in English Youth organizations official website Category:Political parties established in 1906 Category:Liberal parties Category:Nordic Agrarian parties Category:Political parties in Finland Category:ELDR member partiesde:Finnische Zentrumspartei et:Soome Keskerakond es:Partido del Centro (Finlandia) eo:Finnlanda Centro fr:Parti du Centre (Finlande) it:Partito di Centro (Finlandia) nl:Centrumpartij van Finland ja:中央党 (スオミ) no:Centern i Finland nn:Centern i Finland pl:Partia Centrum (Finlandia) fi:Suomen Keskusta sv:Centern i Finland
