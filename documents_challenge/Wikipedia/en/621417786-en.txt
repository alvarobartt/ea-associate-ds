The Chevrolet Camaro is a "pony car" made in North America by the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors. It was introduced on 26 September 1966 as a 1967 model year and was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang. The car shared the platform and major components with the Pontiac Firebird, also introduced in 1967. Four distinct generations of the car were produced before production ended in 2002. A new fifth-generation Camaro will roll off assembly lines in spring of 2009.OriginThough the car's name was contrived with no meaning, Chevrolet researchers reportedly found the word in a French dictionary as variation of informal speech (slang) for "friend", "chum", or "companion." In some automotive periodicals before official release, it was code-named "Panther"; however, the project designation for the Camaro was XP-836 and some early GM photos show the final Camaro body labeled "Chaparral". Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers "What is a Camaro?", and they were told it was "a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs". The name conveniently fits Chevrolet's "C" naming structure that included Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette.The Camaro was initially advertised on contemporary hit radio (Top 40) AM stations of the day in an attempt to woo the young adult market. Technically a compact (by the standards of the time) pony car, the Camaro could also be classified as a sporty muscle car or an economical grand tourer, depending on the selected optional equipment.First generationThe first-generation Chevrolet Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a brand new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform and would be available as a 2-door, 2+2 seating, coupe or convertible with a choice of inline-6 and , , , , or  V8 powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the Corvair, would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its radical rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to bad publicity from Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as Mustang and Chevy II. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro would last until the 1969 model year and would eventually inspire the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro. Second generationIntroduced in February 1970, the second-generation Chevrolet Camaro would be in production for a total of 11 years. The car grew somewhat larger and wider with the new styling, thus resulting in a heavier car. Still based on the F-body platform, the new Camaro was engineered much like its predecessor in that it still used a unibody structure with a front subframe, leaf springs in the back and A-arms up front for suspension. The car would see major changes in both styling and performance as time progressed from the introduction through the end of second-generation production in 1981. Third generationThe third-generation Chevrolet Camaro was introduced for the 1982 model year. It continued to use General Motors' F-body platform and would produce a "20th Anniversary Commemorative Edition" for 1987 and a "25th Anniversary Heritage Edition" for 1992. These were also the first Camaros with throttle body fuel injection, Turbo-Hydramatic 700R4 four-speed automatic transmissions, five-speed manual transmissions, 15 inch or 16-inch wheels, hatchback bodies, and a rear window third brake light. It was during the third generation that the famous IROC-Z Camaro (International Race Of Champions) was available, which included upgrades such as Performance Suspension and 16-inch Z rated tires.The third-generation Camaros would continue through the 1992 model year. Fourth generationThe fourth-generation Chevrolet Camaro debuted for the 1993 model year on an updated F-body platform. It would retain the same characteristics since the first-generation's introduction back in 1967; 2-doors, 2+2 seating, available as a coupé (with optional T-top roof) or convertible (with the latter introduced in 1994), rear-wheel drive, and a choice of V6 and V8 powerplants. Options included the   V6 (changed to   V6 in mid-1995) and the LT1 V8 engine (350&nbsp;CID) 5.7 L V8 with 275hp (flywheel rated) that had been introduced in the Corvette one year earlier, as well as an optional six-speed manual transmission.(The motor was later rated at 285hp) The 1997 model year introduced a newer interior, while the 1998 model year was refreshed and revised with both exterior and engine changes. The engine was replaced with GM's all-aluminum LS1 (346&nbsp;CID) which had been introduced with the Corvette C5.The fourth-gen Camaro would last up through the 2002 model year, marking 35 years of continuous production. Production of the F-Body platform was stopped due to slow sales, a deteriorated sports coupe market, and plant overcapacity. Fifth generation  Based on the 2006 Camaro Concept and 2007 Camaro Convertible Concept, production of the fifth-generation Camaro was approved on 5 August 2006. Oshawa Car Assembly will produce the new Camaro  which will go on sale in spring of 2009 as a 2010 model year vehicle. The 2010 model is offered as a coupe only in LS, LT, and SS trim levels. The LS and LT trim levels will be powered by the LLT  V6 producing .
