Her sister Elizabeth played a hostage in the series pilot. She has appeared in several films, including Riding in Cars with Boys, The Basketball Diaries, Medicine Man, Radio Flyer and Hackers.Bracco received her big career break when offered the role as the mobster-wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. During the audition process for The Sopranos, Bracco had originally vied for the lead female role of Carmela Soprano, but turned it down fearing the part was too similar to her role as the mob-wife in Goodfellas and that the role of mob-psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi would be a new and bigger challenge for her. The role has netted her several award nominations, including three consecutive nominations for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series" at the Emmy Awards in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and at the Golden Globe awards for Best TV Actress in a Drama in 2000, 2001 and 2002. She lost out at the Emmys in 1999 and 2001 and at the Golden Globes in 2000 to her co-star Edie Falco. She was nominated again at the 2007 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, thus being pitted against The Sopranos co-star Aida Turturro for the award.Personal lifeBracco has been married and divorced twice. Her first marriage was to Daniel Guerard from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, after which she entered into a long-term relationship with Harvey Keitel.Lorraine Bracco, On the Couch, p. 129 Following a turbulent breakup with Keitel, she then married Edward James Olmos. She has two children, Stella Keitel and Margaux Guerard. Bracco engaged in a five-year legal battle that ended in 1999 for custody of her daughter Stella from the relationship with Keitel.
