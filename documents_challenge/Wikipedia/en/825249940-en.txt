 | birthplace = Ruislip, Middlesex, England | deathdate = | deathplace = | birthname = | homepage = | academyawards = | spouse = Lorraine Ashbourne (22 July, 2002 – present) Andy Serkis (born 20 April, 1964) is an English actor, director and author.Early lifeSerkis was born and brought up in Ruislip Manor, Middlesex. His father is an ethnic Armenian doctor from Iraq; the family surname was originally "Sarkisian", which is a variant of one of the most common Armenian surnames. He was educated at St Benedict's School, Ealing and at Lancaster University where he originally studied visual art, and was a member of The County College.CareerSerkis' most critically acclaimed roles have been Gollum, or Smeagol, in ''The Lord of the Rings'' movie trilogy (2001–03) and the title character in the 2005 version of King Kong, in which he provided the voice and movements for the CGI characters. Also in Peter's Jackson's King Kong, Andy Serkis played the ship's cook. His performance is ranked #10 on ''Premiere'''s "100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time".suit for King Kong]]His acclaimed work on the trilogy set off a debate on the legitimacy of CGI-assisted acting. Many critics felt Serkis should have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, since the movie used his voice, body language, and facial expressions. There is the argument that some of his CGI actions were partially, or in some cases fully animated, without his own movements, but the same can be said for actors in a traditional movie involving CGI. Some believed (incorrectly) that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ruled that he did not qualify because he never physically appeared onscreen.
