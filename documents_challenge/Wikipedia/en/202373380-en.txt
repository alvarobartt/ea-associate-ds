This makes it, after Mont Blanc, the second most prominent mountain in the Alps, when measured by relative height; see the list of Alpine peaks by prominence.The Grossglockner lies on the border between Carinthia and the East Tyrol; it is the highest peak in the Glockner group, a group of mountains along the main ridge of the Hohe Tauern. The summit itself lies on the Glockner ridge, which branches to the south off the main ridge. The Pasterze, Austria's biggest glacier, lies at the Grossglockner's foot.The characteristically pyramid-shaped peak actually consists of two pinnacles, the Großglockner and the Kleinglockner ''(3,700&nbsp;m; ''klein means "small" in German), separated by a saddle-like formation known as the Glocknerscharte.HistoryThe first assault on the Grossglockner in 1799 failed. In the summer of 1800 a second expedition was organized by Franz Xavier Salm-Raifferscheid, Prince-Bishop of Gurk: 62 people, including 47 guides and porters, took part. An Alpine hut named Salmhütte, at 2750&nbsp;m, was specially built to furnish shelter for this undertaking.On 28 July 1800, the summit was successfully ascended by the brothers Martin and Sepp Klotz, Martin Reicher, an unknown carpenter and Matthias Hautzendorfer. They reached the peak by way of the Hohenwartscharte and Glocknerscharte. Orrasch, or Horasch, in 200 years of alpine history known as first ascender, has never climbed the highest Grossglocknersummit. Marianne Klemun, ''... mit Madame Sonne konferieren.

On 18 August 1876 Hans Tribusser hacked out 2500 steps in the 55° steep ice. G. Bäuerle, J. Kramser, two other guides from Heiligenblut, and Alfred Markgraf Pallavicini followed his track.HochalpenstraßeThe scenic Grossglockner High Alpine Road (Großglockner-Hochalpenstraße) between Heiligenblut and Bruck was built between 1930 and 1935 according to plans of the engineer Franz Wallack and reaches a height of 2572&nbsp;m (8438&nbsp;ft). It is one of the main tourist attractions in Austria and has over 1.2 million visitors every year; however, it is closed in the winter.ReferencesExternal linksGrossglockner HochalpenstrasseGrossglockner at SummitPost.orgGroßglockner Hochalpenstraße : One of the Best Motorcycling Roads in EuropeComputer-generated virtual panoramasNorthSouthIndexGrossglockner webcam with daily time-lapse animationsCategory:Alpine Three-thousanders Category:Mountains of Austria Category:Mountains of the Alpsbe:Гросглокнер (гара) bar:Groaßglockner bg:Гросглокнер ca:Großglockner cs:Grossglockner da:Großglockner de:Großglockner et:Grossglockner es:Grossglockner fr:Grossglockner hr:Grossglockner it:Großglockner he:גרוסגלוקנר lt:Grosglokneris hu:Großglockner mk:Гросглокнер nl:Großglockner ja:グロースグロックナー山 no:Großglockner nn:Großglockner pl:Grossglockner pt:Grossglockner ro:Großglockner ru:Гросглокнер sl:Großglockner sr:Гросглокнер fi:Grossglockner sv:Grossglockner
