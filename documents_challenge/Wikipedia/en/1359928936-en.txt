 Bats of the genus Pteropus, belonging to the Megachiroptera sub-order, are the largest bats in the world. They are commonly known as the Fruit Bats or Flying Foxes among other numerous colloquial names. They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia (including the Indian subcontinent), Australia, Oceania, islands off East Africa (but not the mainland Africa), and a number of remote oceanic islands in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans.The oldest ancestors of the genus Pteropus to be unearthed appear in the fossil record almost exactly as they are today, the only notable differences being early flight adaptations such as a tail for stabilizing. The oldest megachiropteran is dated at around 35 million years ago, but the preceding gap in the fossil record makes their true lineage unknown.Characteristically, all species of flying foxes only feed on nectar, blossom, pollen, and fruit, which explains their limited tropical distribution. They do not possess echolocation, a feature which helps the other sub-order of bats, the Microbats, locate and catch prey such as insects in mid-air. Instead, smell and eyesight are very well-developed in flying foxes. Feeding ranges can reach up to 40 miles. When it locates food, the flying fox "crashes" into foliage and grabs for it. It may also attempt to catch hold of a branch with its hind feet, then swing upside down — once attached and hanging, the fox draws food to its mouth with one of its hind feet or with the clawed thumbs at the top of its wings.The flying fox has been suggested as the source of at least some of the apparent "pterodactyl" sightings in Papua New Guinea, but this is contradicted by accounts of fish-eating habits of what is called the ropen. (Flying foxes do not eat fish.)StatusMany species are threatened today with extinction, and in particular in the Pacific a number of species have died out as a result of over-harvesting for human consumption. In Ghana and the Marianas, flying fox meat is considered a delicacy, which led to a large commercial trade. In 1989 all species of Pteropus were placed on Appendix 2 (threatened) of CITES and at least seven on Appendix 1 (endangered). The subspecies P. h. maris of the Maldives is considered endangered due to limited distribution and excessive culling. The commerce in fruit bats continues either illegally or because of inadequate restrictions. Local farmers may also attack the bats because they feed in their plantations, and in some cultures it is believed their meat can cure asthma. Non-human predators include birds of prey, snakes, and other mammals.The Spectacled Flying Fox, native to Australia, is threatened by the paralysis tick which carries paralyzing toxins.Mueller, R. 2000. "Pteropus conspicillatus" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed May 03, 2007 at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pteropus_conspicillatus.htmlPhysical CharacteristicsOn average, P. vampyrus is the largest species, with a wingspan of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) but a weight of only up to 1.5 kg (3.3 lb.). Other species have impressive widths, such as the Indian flying fox (P. giganteus) which has a 4 foot (1.2 meter) wingspan. Pelage is long and silky with a dense underfur. No tail is present. As the name suggests, the head resembles that of a small fox because of the small ears and large eyes. Females have one pair of mammae located in the chest region. Ears are simple (long and pointed) with the outer margin forming an unbroken ring (a defining characteristic of megabats). Toes have sharp curved claws.SpeciesAdmiralty Flying-fox Pteropus admiralitatumAldabra Flying Fox Pteropus aldabrensisBlack Flying-fox Pteropus alectoVanauatu Flying Fox Pteropus anetianusAru Flying Fox Pteropus aruensisTorresian Flying Fox Pteropus banakrisiDusky Flying Fox Pteropus brunneusAshy-headed Flying-fox Pteropus canicepsBismark Masked Flying Fox Pteropus capistratusAmbon Flying-fox Pteropus chrysoproctusMakira Flying Fox Pteropus cognatusSpectacled Flying-fox Pteropus conspicillatusRyukyu Flying-fox Pteropus dasymallusNicobar Flying Fox Pteropus faunulusBanks Flying Fox Pteropus fundatusIndian Flying-fox Pteropus giganteusGilliard's Flying-fox Pteropus gilliardorumGray Flying-fox Pteropus griseusOntong Java Flying Fox Pteropus howensisSmall Flying-fox Pteropus hypomelanusChuuk Flying-fox Pteropus insularisAndersen's Flying Fox Pteropus intermediusKei Flying Fox Pteropus keyensisWhite-winged Flying Fox Pteropus leucopterusLivingstone's Fruit Bat Pteropus livingstoniiLombok Flying Fox Pteropus lombocensisOkinawa Flying-fox Pteropus loochoensisLyle's Flying Fox Pteropus lyleiBig-eared Flying Fox Pteropus macrotisLesser Flying-fox Pteropus mahaganusMariana Fruit Bat Pteropus mariannusBlack-bearded Flying Fox Pteropus melanopogonBlack-eared Flying Fox Pteropus melanotusCaroline Flying Fox Pteropus molossinusBismarck Flying-fox Pteropus neohibernicusMauritian flying fox Pteropus nigerTemotu Flying Fox Pteropus nitendiensisCeram Fruit Bat Pteropus ocularisOrnate Flying Fox Pteropus ornatusPelew Flying Fox Pteropus pelewensisMasked Flying Fox Pteropus personatusLarge Palau Flying Fox Pteropus pilosusGeelvink Bay Flying Fox Pteropus pohleiGrey-headed Flying Fox Pteropus poliocephalusBonin Flying Fox Pteropus pselaphonLittle Golden-mantled Flying Fox Pteropus pumilusSolomons Flying-fox Pteropus rayneriRennell Flying Fox Pteropus rennelliRodrigues Flying Fox Pteropus rodricensisMadagascan Flying Fox Pteropus rufusSamoa Flying-fox Pteropus samoensisLittle Red Flying-fox Pteropus scapulatusSeychelles fruit bat Pteropus seychellensisPhilippine Gray Flying Fox Pteropus speciosusSmall Mauritian flying fox Pteropus subnigerTemminck's Flying Fox Pteropus temminckiiGuam flying fox Pteropus tokudaeInsular Flying-fox Pteropus tonganusVanikoro Flying Fox Pteropus tuberculatusKosrae Flying Fox Pteropus ualanusLarge Flying Fox Pteropus vampyrusNew Caledonia Flying Fox Pteropus vetulusPemba Flying Fox Pteropus voeltzkowiDwarf Flying Fox Pteropus woodfordiYap Flying Fox Pteropus yapensisGallery Image:Pteropus vampyrus2.jpg|''Pteropus vampyrus'' Image:bristol.zoo.livfruitbat.arp.jpg|Livingstone’s Fruit Bat Pteropus livingstonii Image:Foxbat-2.jpg| Pteropus poliocephalus in Currumbin, Queensland Australia Image:Foxbat-8.jpg| Pteropus poliocephalus in Currumbin, Queensland Australia Image:Pteropus_vampyrus_3.jpg| Pteropus poliocephalus in Currumbin, Queensland Australia Image:Flying bat with tree orig.JPG | Pteropus poliocephalus in Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Australia Image:Hanging flying foxes.JPG | Pteropus poliocephalus in Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Australia Image:Flying fox stretching.JPG | Pteropus poliocephalus in Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Australia.
