A third title, God of War III, is also in development for PlayStation 3.PlotThe story of God of War revolves around Kratos, a former captain in the Spartan army who sets out to kill Ares, the god of war. It is the goddess Athena who requests him to kill Ares, as his army launched an assault to destroy her patron city, Athens. With Zeus forbidding the gods from directly declaring war against each other, only a mortal can stop Ares. But Kratos is already motivated by revenge; as the game progresses, Kratos' backstory is gradually explained, revealing that he had formerly been a servant of Ares, but had renounced his service after the god tricked him into killing his own family.After fighting through Athens, Kratos learns from the city Oracle that there is only one way to defeat Ares, by using the legendary Pandora's Box, which can give a mortal the power to kill a god. The Oracle explains that the Box is hidden within the Temple of Pandora, carried on the back of the last living Titan Cronos, who has been commanded by Zeus to endlessly wander the Desert of Lost Souls, as punishment for his past actions. Kratos travels to the Desert to find Cronos, and upon doing so, enters the Temple.Most of the game takes place within the Temple, inside which Kratos must solve puzzles and overcome hostile creatures to reach Pandora's Box. Ultimately he retrieves the magical artifact, but as he does so, Ares senses his success and kills him by hurling a broken pillar at him from Athens. After doing so, Ares sends harpies to claim the Box for himself. Kratos meanwhile, falls in to Hades, the ancient Greek realm of the dead, but manages to grab onto a ledge and climb back into the world of the living, fighting past more creatures in the process.After escaping from the Underworld, Kratos again recovers Pandora's Box this time from Ares, who threatens to usurp the other gods of Olympus, and opens it. The Box causes him to grow until he is the same size as Ares, and the two engage one another in battle. When Kratos has the upper hand, Ares traps him in an illusory world in which he is shown images of his family&mdash;whom he had killed many years before&mdash;and is forced to defend them against copies of himself. After seemingly saving them, Ares strips Kratos of his Blades of Chaos and magical powers (granted by various gods along his journey), and kills his family with them. Kratos returns to the battleground and, after finding the Blade of the Gods nearby, succeeds in defeating and killing Ares.After his victory, Athena appears and takes him to Mount Olympus where, because of his service to the gods, he is offered the chance to become the new god of war. As a replacement for his lost Blades of Chaos, Kratos is given the Blades of Athena. Essentially the same as his old weapon, the Blades of Athena have an additional gold tinge.GameplayGod of War is a third-person action video game, focused on the player using melee attacks, magic abilities, and combinations of the two to defeat foes. The player controls Kratos' movements, including jumping, swimming, and climbing, as well as his attacks. Kratos' primary weapons are the Blades of Chaos, which can be used in a number of different types of attacks, varying in power, speed, and range of damage. Throughout the game, Kratos also gains the abilities of several magical artifacts, such as the head of Medusa that can be used to turn foes into stone. Damaging and killing an enemy will release one of three types of orbs: red orbs can be redeemed to power up Kratos' attacks, and green and blue orbs immediately restore Kratos' health and magic, respectively. As the player fights, a meter reflecting the "Rage of the Gods" begins to fill; when the meter is full, the player can activate the power by pressing the L3 and R3 buttons at the same time. This temporarily increase Kratos's attack power, and Kratos is engulfed by electricity (Zeus's Lightning). Should Kratos lose all his health, the game is over, but the player has the option of restarting at the last checkpoint; the game will also offer the player the opportunity to attempt the game at a lower difficulty level if they have restarted from the same checkpoint several times in a row. The lower difficulty only changes the enemies skill, and does not help in the many puzzles throughout the game.When certain enemies, in particular certain boss battles and larger foes, are low in health, the player can initiate a special Quick Time Event killing sequence as indicated by a marker over the enemy's head (the Circle button symbol). This starts a sequence of moves by Kratos that will display a controller button or an analog-stick action briefly on the screen during the attack; the player must hit that button or move the analog stick as indicated within a short time for the killing sequence to continue, otherwise the sequence will be broken and the enemy will grab Kratos and toss him away. However, if the player successfully responds to each sequence, then Kratos will finish off the enemy in a bloody and spectacular fashion, and gain a higher yield of orbs. Most bosses can only be killed using these "fatality" minigames, increasing the cinematic feel of the game.In addition to the melee aspects of the game, the player will also need to solve environmental puzzles, such as sliding boxes or statues around to depress switches, turning levers to open doors, or similar moves. Chests are scattered about the levels, and can be opened to reveal orbs, gorgon eyes, or phoenix feathers, the latter two can be collected to expand Kratos' health and magic capacity, respectively. Destructible environmental objects can also be broken to retrieve red orbs. Each of Kratos' abilities can be improved using the red orbs; each of the abilities have several levels that improves that ability's effectiveness as well as introducing new combination moves the player can use.Most of the foes in the game are inspired by creatures from Greek mythology, including Medusa, the Minotaur, and the Lernaean Hydra, among others.SoundtrackThe score of God of War was composed by Gerard K. Marino, Ron Fish, Winifred Phillips, Mike Reagan, Cris Velasco and Winnie Waldron and released as an exclusive product for the Sony Connect Music Store on March 1, 2005.
