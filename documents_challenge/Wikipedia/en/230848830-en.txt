The Forer effect (also called personal validation fallacy or the Barnum Effect after P. T. Barnum's observation that "we've got something for everyone") is the observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. The Forer effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some pseudosciences such as astrology and fortune telling, as well as many types of personality tests.A related and more generic phenomenon effect is that of subjective validation (Marks, 2000, p. 41). Subjective validation occurs when two unrelated or even random events are perceived to be related because a belief, expectancy, or hypothesis demands a relationship. Thus people seek a correspondence between their perception of their personality and the contents of a horoscope.Forer's demonstrationIn 1948, psychologist Bertram R. Forer gave a personality test to his students. Afterward, he told his students they were each receiving a unique personality analysis that was based on the test's results and to rate their analysis on a scale of 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) on how well it applied to themselves. In reality, each received the same analysis:Only after the ratings were turned in was it revealed that each student had received identical copies. On average, the rating was 4.26.Forer had assembled this text from horoscopes.Variables influencing the effectLater studies have found that subjects give higher accuracy ratings if the following are true:the subject believes that the analysis applies only to themthe subject believes in the authority of the evaluatorthe analysis lists mainly positive traitsSee (Dickson and Kelly 1985) for a review of the literature.See alsoList of cognitive biasesCold readingJohn EdwardReferencesExternal linksAn autotestOnline test demonstrating the effectSkeptic's Dictionary: the Forer effectThe Forer effect demonstrated with horoscopes (video, RealMedia format)A demonstration of the Forer effect by Derren BrownThe Forer Effect evidenced in astrologyCategory: articles needing expert attention Category:Miscellaneous articles needing expert attention &amp;#32;since  Category:Pages needing expert attention Category:History of astrology Category:Cognitive biasesde:Barnum-Effekt es:Efecto Forer fr:Effet Barnum hr:Forerov efekt it:Effetto Forer he:אפקט פורר lt:Forerio efektas hu:Forer-hatás nl:Forer-effect ja:バーナム効果 pl:Efekt horoskopowy ru:Эффект Барнума fi:Forer-efekti uk:Ефект Форера zh:巴納姆效應
