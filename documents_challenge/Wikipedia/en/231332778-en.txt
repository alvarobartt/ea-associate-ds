Behind the Mask, Uncaged Films, 2006.HistoryGoldfinger was formed by John Feldmann on vocals and guitar, Simon Williams on bass, Darrin Pfeiffer on drums, and Charlie Paulson on guitar. Before they were signed to a major label, they released an EP titled Richter. Many of the songs on Richter are demo versions of songs on their full length debut, Goldfinger, which was released in 1996. Though their second album, Hang-Ups, was less successful, the band still maintained a devoted fan base in the hardcore community. Their third studio LP was Stomping Ground, which sold poorly in the US but was a modest hit in some European countries, thanks to their cover of Nena's "99 Luftballons" sung partly in German. Their next album, Open Your Eyes (2002), was the first for their new record label, Jive/Zomba.Frontman John Feldmann has produced records for Mest, The Used (whose vocalist Bert McCracken sang some guest vocals on 'Open Your Eyes', 'Woodchuck', 'Ocean Size', and 'Handjobs for Jesus'), Hilary Duff and Story of the Year. He also produced Good Charlotte's single "The Anthem" (whose guitarist Benji Madden provides guest vocals on 'January', which was originally named "Oracle of Elcaro". He also signed the band Unloco with Maverick Records.Since the band began, Feldmann has become a vegan and animal rights supporter, as can be seen briefly in the music video for "Open Your Eyes". They also donated the song "What Gives You The Right" to the Southern Animal Rights Coalition benefit CD, "Until Every Cage Is Empty",Until Every Cage Is Empty - £5.00 : Animal Rights Merchandise, The SARCshop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; as well as writing the song "Free Kevin Kjonaas", an animal rights prisoner, known as the most involved individual in the SHAC 7 case. He also advocates and supports the Animal Liberation Front.In early 2005, they released their first album for their new label, Maverick Records, titled "Disconnection Notice". It featured the single "Wasted". The CD was less well received compared to former Goldfinger albums. Former band members include founding bassist Simon Williams, who left the band following Hang-Ups, and former Unloco guitarist Brian Arthur, who was fired by Feldmann because Feldmann "did not want to work with him anymore"."99 Red Balloons" also featured in Not Another Teen Movie along with Eurotrip, and their cover of The Spiral Starecase's "More Today Than Yesterday" plays during the ending credits of The Waterboy. "Superman" was also featured in the comedy Kingpin and the first Tony Hawk Pro Skater video game. "Walking in the Dark" was featured in the movie "Dead Man on Campus".Goldfinger covered the hit Duran Duran song Rio as a tribute to the band but ironically the middle of the song turns into a Dio-like song and then changing the last chorus to Ronnie James Dio rather than Rio.Goldfinger's song "I Want" from Disconnection Notice is featured in Burnout Revenge on the Playstation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360, and the song "My Everything" is featured on "SSX On Tour" also by EA games. The single, Spokesman, is featured on Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.Goldfinger also appeared in the Reel Big Fish video "Sell Out" for a brief couple of seconds.2006 saw Alternative Press Magazine list the self titled Goldfinger CD as one of the "10 albums that shaped 1996" alongside No Doubt, Weezer and others.In 2005 Goldfinger announced that their old guitarist Charlie Paulson would return. Charlie's return to the band was on stage playing 3 songs at the Key Club in LA when the band finished a Western USA tour.
