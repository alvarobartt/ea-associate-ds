He was chosen by Portuguese sports newspaper 'Record' as one of the best 100 Portuguese football players of all time.Club careerAs a junior player, he started at the junior team of FC Porto. As professional player, he played for Académica de Coimbra and Benfica, before ending his career in Belenenses, in the 1977&ndash;78 season, due to a serious injury. During his player days in Coimbra, Jorge was a student at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Coimbra, graduating in Germanic Philology from the University of Lisbon in 1975, after his transfer to Lisbon's Benfica. During his career as a player, he won four Portuguese Football Championships, two Portuguese Football Cups and two silver boots, as the prize for best goalscorer. Despite having been one of the top scorers at Benfica during his time there, the concurrence of other great forwards, like Eusébio, Jordão and Nené, explain why he had only 16 caps for the Portugal National Team, 2 while at Académica de Coimbra, 13 at Benfica and 1 while playing for Belenenses, scoring only one goal during his international career. His debut, on 27 March 1967, was a 1-1 draw with Italy, in a friendly match, in Rome. His last game, was on 30 March 1977, resulted in a 1-0 win over Switzerland, in another friendly match, in Funchal. He was a member of the squad that reached the Independence Brazil Cup final, in 1972, the highest point of his international career. He underwent knee surgery five times during his career, this is attributed as one of the causes of his declining abilities at the end of the career. Though his career would ultimately come to an end as the reulst of a training ground accident at the Estádio Nacional, where he broke his leg.ManagerAfter his player career, he went to Leipzig in then East Germany, to study football and training methodology. He signed at F.C. Porto for the 1984/85 season, where he won three National Champion titles and two Cups of Portugal.His greatest success was to win the European Champions Cup with F.C.
