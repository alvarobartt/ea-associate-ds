 The flag of Lebanon () is formed of two horizontal red stripes enveloping a horizontal white stripe. The white stripe is to be two times a red one (ratio 1:2:1)—a Spanish fess. The green cedar in the middle touches each of the red stripes and its width is one third of the width of the flag.The description of the flag is cited in the Lebanese Constitution, Chapter 1, Article 5. It was adopted on December 7, 1943. The current flag was first drawn in Deputy Saeb Salam's house in Mousaitbeh by the deputies of the Lebanese parliament. The present Lebanese flag was adopted just prior to independence from France in 1943. It was designed to be a neutral flag, not allied to any one of Lebanon's religious groups. Red is thought to be for the color of the uniforms worn by the Lebanese Legion during World War I. Officially the red is said to represent the people of Lebanon's sacrifice during the struggle for independence, and white represents purity and peace. Although the flag has existed only for half a century, the tree at the center of the flag- the Cedar of Lebanon- has been an emblem of the country since the time of King Solomon, almost 2,000 years ago. Specifically, the cedar is the symbol of the country's Maronite Christian community. It first appeared on a flag in 1861 when Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire. Soon after its collapse, the country became mandated to France and its flag was a French Tricolore, with the Cedar of Lebanon in the white band of the Tricolore. The cedar symbolizes happiness and prosperity for the country.It is a common mistake to draw the branches of the cedar and the tree trunk in brown or black. Nevertheless the mistake could be seen as unconstitutional. The cedar should be fully green regarding the provisions in the Constitution.SymbolismThe red stripes symbolize the pure blood shed in the aim of liberation. The white stripe symbolizes peace, and the white snow covering Lebanon's mountains. The green cedar (Arz) (Species: Cedrus libani or Lebanon Cedar) symbolizes immortality and steadiness.  This cedar is referenced many times in the Bible: "The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon" (Psalms 92:12).Psalm 92:12 The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; There is also some reference in W. Smith's 1980 book on the colours: "The red and white colours are those associated, respectively, with the Kayssites and Yemenites, opposing clans that divided Lebanese society between 634 and 1711 AD". However, that explanation is poorly known (not to mention quite unheard of) in the Lebanese tradition.HistoryThe Lebanese flag after the fall of the Ottoman empire.]] Through history, Lebanon, or at least its region, had taken the flag of the people who occupied it (Mamluk, Ottoman Empire)In the 18th century the Maronites used a white flag with a cedar tree in the centre. It seems that in the First World War, Lebanese nationalists added the red stripes, representing firstly, the martyrs' blood, and secondly, red and white were the colours of the Lebanese Legion, which, formed by the French in 1916, was the forerunner of the Lebanese Army. French Mandate of LebanonThe Lebanese flag, during the French mandate (1918-1943).]] During the French Mandate of Lebanon, the Lebanese flag was designed by the president of the Lebanese Renaissance Movement, the late Naoum Mukarzel. It was similar to the tricolour flag of France but with a Cedar in the middle. Lebanese Republic  Seeking for independence, the actual flag was first drawn by member of parliament Henri Pharaon in the Chamber of deputies Saeb Salam's house in Mousaitbeh by the deputies of the Lebanese parliament. It was adopted on December 7 1943, during a meeting in the parliament, where the article 5 in the Lebanese constitution was modified.Gallery of Historic Flags of LebanonThe following is a list of historic flags used in LebanonHistorical Flags (Lebanon)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;  Image:Flag_of_Lebanon.svg|Current Flag Image:Lebanese flag.JPG|Flag as drawn and approved by the members of the parliament during the declaration of independence in 1943 Image:Lebanon_French_Mandate_Flag.png|Flag of Lebanon during the French mandate 1920-1943 Image:Lebanon_French_Mandate_Flag2.png|Flag of Lebanon during the French mandate 1920-1943 (Variant) Image:Lebanon_French_Mandate_Flag3.png|Flag of Lebanon during the French mandate 1920-1943 (Variant) Image:Lebanon_French_Mandate_Flag4.png|Flag of Lebanon at the beginning of the French mandate 1920 Image:Kingdom_Of_Syria_Flag.png|Flag during the short lived Kingdom of Syria from March 8th to July 24th 1920 Image:Kingdom_Of_Syria2_Flag.png|Flag during the short lived Kingdom of Syria from March 8th to July 24th 1920 (variant) Image:Arab_Administration_on_Lebanon_Flag.png|Flag used in the post WWI under the Arab Administration 1918-1920 Image:Cedar_flag.svg|Flag used unofficially since 1848 until the French Mandate Image:Deir_El_Qamar_Flag.png|Flag used in Deir El Qamar, Capital of the Maanid and early Chehab emirs 1830 Image:Chehab_Emirate_Flag.png|Flag of the Chehab Emirate 1697-1842 Image:Flag_of_Ayyubid_Dynasty.svg|Flag under the Mamluk Sultunate 1250-1517 Image:Mameluke_Flag.svg|Flag under the Mamluk Sultunate 1250-1517(variant) Image:Maanid_Flag.png|Flag of the Maanid Emirate 1119-1697 Image:Jumblatian_Flag.png|Feudal Flag of the Jumblat clan during Middle Ages Image:Abu_Kanad_Flag.png|Feudal Flag of the Abu Kanad clan during Middle Ages Image:Lamaite_Flag.png|Feudal Flag of the Lamaite princes during Middle Ages Image:Merdai_Rebels_Flag.png|Rebels Flag during the Merdai era (Yemenites) Image:Kaissy_Flag.png|National Maanid Flag Image:Prince_Ibrahim_Rebels_Flag.png|Rebels' Flag during Prince Ibrahim Era Image:Flag_of_Kingdom_of_Jerusalem.svg|Kingdom of Jerusalem Flag 1099-1291 Image:Flag_of_Afghanistan_pre-1901.svg|Flag under the Abbasid Caliphate 750-1258 Image:Umayyad_Flag.png|Flag under the Ummayyad Caliphate 660-750 Image:Tanukh_Flag.png|Tanukh Flag 200 AD - 400 AD Image:Phoenician_Flag.png|Flag used during Phoenician era 3000 BC - 200 AD See alsoCoat of arms of LebanonNotesExternal linksFlag of Lebanon from Flags of the World  Category:National symbols of Lebanon Lebanonar:علم لبنان bn:লেবাননের জাতীয় পতাকা bs:Zastava Libanona ca:Bandera del Líban cv:Ливан ялавĕ cs:Libanonská vlajka cy:Baner Libanus da:Libanons flag de:Flagge Libanons et:Liibanoni lipp el:Σημαία του Λιβάνου es:Bandera del Líbano fr:Drapeau du Liban hy:Լիբանանի դրոշ bpy:লেবাননর ফিরালহান id:Bendera Lebanon it:Bandiera libanese he:דגל לבנון lt:Libano vėliava hu:Libanon zászlaja nl:Vlag van Libanon ja:レバノンの国旗 no:Libanons flagg pl:Flaga Libanu pt:Bandeira do Líbano ru:Флаг Ливана sk:Vlajka Libanonu sh:Zastava Libanona fi:Libanonin lippu sv:Libanons flagga th:ธงชาติเลบานอน tr:Lübnan bayrağı zh:黎巴嫩国旗
