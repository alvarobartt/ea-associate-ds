  Harburg is a district (Landkreis) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Lüneburg, Soltau-Fallingbostel, Rotenburg and Stade, by the City of Hamburg and the State of Schleswig-Holstein (District of Lauenburg).HistoryIn 1885 the Prussian government established three districts in this region: the District of Harburg, the District of Winsen and the district-free City of Harburg. In 1932 the districts of Winsen and Harburg were merged; the City of Harburg-Wilhelmsburg (which had been renamed in 1927) became the capital of the district, although it remained district-free and hence was not a part of the district.In 1937 the City of Harburg-Wilhelmsburg was incorporated into the City of Hamburg with the Greater Hamburg Act. Harburg and Wilhelmsburg became two boroughs of Hamburg. The District of Harburg remained with the State of Prussia and retained its autonomy. Winsen became the new capital of the District in 1944.GeographyThe District is located south of Hamburg and includes several suburbs of the Hamburg metropolitan area. In the south of the district part of the Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide) is found.Coat of armsCities and municipalitiesCitiesSamtgemeinden1seat of the SamtgemeindeExternal linksOfficial site Category:Districts of Lower Saxonyde:Landkreis Harburg es:Distrito de Harburg eo:Distrikto Harburg fr:Arrondissement de Harburg id:Harburg nl:Harburg (district) pl:Powiat Harburg pt:Harburg (distrito) ro:Harburg (district) ru:Харбург (район) sv:Landkreis Harburg zh:哈尔堡县
