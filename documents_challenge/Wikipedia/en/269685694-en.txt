It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively S$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cents.HistoryBetween 1845 and 1939, Singapore used the Straits dollar. This was replaced by the Malayan dollar, and, from 1953, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar, which were issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.Singapore continued to use the common currency upon joining Malaysia in 1963 but, two years after Singapore's expulsion and independence from Malaysia in 1965, the monetary union between Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei broke down. Singapore established the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore, on April 7, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;and issued its first coins and notes. Nevertheless, the Singapore dollar was exchangeable at par with the Malaysian ringgit until 1973, although interchangeability with the Brunei dollar is still maintained until now.Initially, the Singapore dollar was pegged to the British pound sterling at a rate of S$60 = £7. This peg lasted until the demise of the Sterling Area in the early 1970s, after which the Singapore dollar was linked to the US dollar for a short period of time. As Singapore's economy grew and its trade links diversified to many other countries and regions, Singapore moved towards pegging its currency against a fixed and undisclosed trade-weighted basket of currencies from 1973-1985. From 1985 onwards, Singapore adopted a more market-oriented exchange regime - classified as a Monitoring Band - in which the Singapore dollar is allowed to float (within an undisclosed bandwidth of a central parity) but closely monitored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) against a concealed basket of currencies of Singapore's major trading partners and competitors. This in theory allows the Singaporean government to have more control over imported inflation and to ensure that Singapore's exports remain competitive. All issued Singapore dollar currency in circulation is fully backed by international assets to maintain public confidence.International Economics - Historial Exchange Rate Regime of Asian Countries The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Copyright 2000.

Except for the bronze 1 cent, these coins were struck in cupro-nickel. In 1985, a second series of coins was introduced in the same denominations. The sizes of the coins were reduced (most substantially for the larger denominations) and the 5 cents was struck in aluminium-bronze. In 1987, the 1 dollar coin was further reduced in size and switched to being struck in aluminium-bronze.First Series (1967 - 1985) http://www.singaporemint.com/display.php?ID=93ValueTechnical parametersDescriptionDate of issueDiameterThicknessMassCompositionEdgeObverseReverse1 cent17.780 mm1.118 mm1.940 gBronzePlainValue and YearA high - rise public housing block with a fountain in front and clouds in the backgroundJune 12, 19671 cent1.240 gCopper-clad steel19765 cents16.26 mm1.02 mm1.410 gCupro-nickelMilledValue and YearA snake-bird sitting in its nest and preening its feathers.June 12, 19675 cents1.260 gCupro-nickel clad steelFAO]])21.23 mm1.27 mm1.240 gAluminiumA fish and the phrases "INCREASE PRODUCTION" and "MORE FOOD FROM THE SEA."197110 cents19.41 mm1.40 mm2.83 gCupro-nickelA seahorse with a stylized piece of seaweed.June 12, 196720 cents23.60 mm1.78 mm5.66 gA swordfish against a background symbolizing water.50 cents27.76 mm2.03 mm9.33 gA lionfish from tropical waters.$133.32 mm2.39 mm16.85gA stylized Singapore lion symbol flanked by two stalks of paddy.The current series of coins feature the Coat of Arms of Singapore on the obverse, and a floral theme on the reverse.Second Series (1985 - present) http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency_info/coins/second_series/Singapore_Circulation_Coins_Second_Series.htmlValueTechnical parametersDescriptionDate of issueDiameterThicknessMassCompositionEdgeObverseReverse1 cent15.9 mm1.1 mm1.24 gCopper-plated zincPlainCoat of Arms]], "Singapore" in 4 official languagesValue, Vanda Miss JoaquimSeptember 28, 19875 cents16.75 mm1.22 mm1.56 gAluminium bronzeReededCoat of Arms]], "Singapore" in 4 official languagesValue, Monstera deliciosaDecember 2, 198510 cents18.5 mm1.38 mm2.6 gCupronickelReededCoat of Arms, "Singapore" in 4 official languagesJasminum multiflorum]]December 2, 198520 cents21.36 mm1.72 mm4.5 gCalliandra surinamensis]]50 cents24.66 mm2.06 mm7.29 gReededValue, Allamanda CatharticaDecember 2, 198550 centsInscribed "REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE" and the lion symbolMay 28, 1990$122.40 mm2.4 mm6.3 gAluminium bronzeInscribed "REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE" and the lion symbolCoat of Arms]], "Singapore" in 4 official languagesLochnera rosea]]September 28, 1987Note:6.81 million 1 cent coins are in circulation as at 1 December 2006, but are no longer issued since 2003.5.86 million 5 cent coins are still in circulation as at 1 December 2006, but are no longer issued.BanknotesOn June 12, 1967, the first series of notes, known as the Orchid series, was introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10,50, 100 and 1000 dollars. 25 and 500 dollar notes were introduced in 1972, followed by 10,000 dollars in 1973.

These notes feature the face of Yusof bin Ishak, the first president of the Republic of Singapore, on the obverse, and the reverse depicts a feature of civic virtue. There are both paper and polymer notes in circulation. The designs of the polymer notes are very similar to the corresponding paper note except for the slightly slippery feel and a small transparent window design in the corner of the banknote. Polymer notes are progressively replacing the paper banknotes in circulation. On 27 June 2007, to commemorate 40 years of currency agreement with Brunei, the $20 note was launched; the back is identical to the Bruneian $20 note launched concurrently. A circulation version of the $20 note can be exchanged at banks in Singapore beginning July 16, 2007, limited to two pieces per transaction.Singapore Portrait Series comemorative banknotehttp://www.singaporemint.com/default.php?cPath=1_9_144ImageValueDimensionsMain ColourDescriptionDate of issueRemarkObverseReverseObverseReverse$20145 × 69 mmyellow/brownPresident Yusof bin Ishak,“Dendrobium Puan Noor Aishah” orchidtext “BRUNEI DARUSSALAM ∙ SINGAPORE and CURRENCY INTERCHANGEABILITY AGREEMENT 1967 - 2007” and national landmarks of Singapore and Brunei.27 June 2007commemorative Portrait seriesSee alsoEconomy of SingaporeReferences External links Monetary Authority of Singapore Exchange PolicyWill's Online World Paper Money Gallery - Images of banknotes from around the world including a large collection of banknotes from Singapore     *ast:Dólar de Singapur be-x-old:Сынгапурскі даляр ca:Dòlar de Singapur cs:Singapurský dolar da:Singaporeansk dollar de:Singapur-Dollar es:Dólar de Singapur fr:Dollar de Singapour ko:싱가포르 달러 bpy:সিঙ্গাপুরি ডলার id:Dolar Singapura it:Dollaro di Singapore he:דולר סינגפורי lt:Singapūro doleris hu:Szingapúri dollár mr:सिंगापूर डॉलर ms:Dolar Singapura nl:Singaporese dollar ja:シンガポールドル pl:Dolar singapurski pt:Dólar de Cingapura ru:Сингапурский доллар simple:Singapore Dollar sv:Singaporiansk dollar ta:சிங்கப்பூர் வெள்ளி th:ดอลลาร์สิงคโปร์ vi:Dollar Singapore tr:Singapur Doları zh:新加坡元
