Quilmes Atlético Club is the oldest football team in Argentina currently playing in the Argentine 2nd division.Founded in 1887 by J. T.

Its first team was completely formed by British immigrants:Fothergil; Penman (captain), Francis; Tuker, Wilson, Moffat; Lamont, Muir, Belaumont, Morgan and Cladewell.The club acquired its current name in 1950, because Perón wanted to change it to a Spanish form.Also known as El Cervecero (The Brewers) because of the Cerveza Quilmes brewery of the same city (which sponsors them), it won the 1912 amateur championship, the second division titles of 1949, 1961, 1975, 1986/87, 1990/91, and the first division 1978 Metropolitano.Quilmes started building a new stadium in 1987 to inaugurate it first in 1993, and then officially in 1995.
