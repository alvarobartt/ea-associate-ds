 Omagh (pronounced ; ) is the county town of County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, situated where the rivers Drumragh and Camowen meet to form the Strule. The town, which is the largest in the county, has an estimated population of 22,182 and a further 30,017 live in the Omagh District Council area (2008 estimates). Omagh also contains the headquarters of Omagh District Council.It is the county town of Tyrone, having taken the title from Dungannon around 1768. The town is said to owe its origins to an abbey founded in 792 CE, making it one of the oldest towns in Ireland.The town is in west central Ulster and is traditionally considered to be part of West Tyrone.The town is twinned with L'Haÿ-les-Roses, France.HistoryOmagh was founded as a town in 1610, nearly 150 years after the foundation of the Franciscan Friary in the town. It served as a refuge for fugitives from the east of Tyrone during the 1641 Rebellion. In 1689, the same year as the Battle of the Boyne, James II arrived at Omagh, en route to Derry. Supporters of William III, Prince of Orange, burnt the town.In 1768, Omagh replaced Dungannon as the county town of Tyrone. Omagh acquired railway links to Derry in 1852, Enniskillen in 1853 and Belfast in 1861. The Military Barracks was built in 1881. In 1899 Tyrone County Hospital was opened. Today the hospital is the subject of a massive campaign to save its services. The Ulster Transport Authority closed the Omagh-Enniskillen railway line in 1957 and the Portadown-Derry main line in 1965, leaving the town with no rail service. The town's large military barracks closed on 1 August 2007.Famous visitors to Omagh have included U.S. President Bill Clinton, Irish President Mary McAleese, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.The TroublesOmagh came into the international focus of the media on 15 August 1998, when the Real Irish Republican Army exploded a car bomb in the town centre. 29 people were killed in the blast — 14 women (including one pregnant with twins), 9 children and 6 men. Hundreds more were injured as a result of the blast.GeographyDivisions and suburbsThese wards are only in the town, there are many outside the town in the council area.These can also double as neighbourhoods.

Rainfall is pretty much constant throughout the year. Omagh, as an inland area, has a more extreme climate than Irish coastal areas. In the summer, daytime temperatures usually range from 17°C to 19°C (63°F to 66°F) with warm days often extending to 20°C (68°F) or higher. Temperatures surpassing 30°C (86°F) usually happen once every decade. Night time temperatures are usually between 9°C and 12°C (49°F and 53°F) though rather uncomfortable and humid temperatures of up to 20°C (68°F) have occurred. Thunderstorms are also rare, though some will happen, usually between June and August.During the winter the days are usually either cloudy and mild (and often wet) or sunny and cool. Snow is fairly common (especially on the hills/mountains) and tends to fall during the months of December, January and February though it has been known for it to fall as early as September and as late as May. Temperatures in winter normally range from 7°C to 10°C (45°F to 50°F) during the day, and fall back to 3°C to 5°C (37°F to 41°F) at night. On cooler days the temperature can often struggle to rise above 2°C or 3°C (35°F or 37°F) or even above freezing (0°C or 32°F) during the day, and fall below freezing at night. On very cold nights the temperature can fall as low as -7°C (19°F) while in late December 1995 a temperature of -17.6°C (0°F) was recorded. An air temperature of -19.4°C (-3°F) was recorded once, and it remains the coldest air temperature ever recorded in Ireland.Premier Irish Forestry Fund+ Climate TableJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecYear°C]])78101215171819171310712.8°C]])334469111297536.3Mean total rainfall (mm)98.597.960.677.466.669.671.368.380.6126.895.598.61,107.2Source: MSN WeatherFloodsOmagh has a history of flooding and suffered major floods in 1909, 1929, 1954, 1969, 1987, 1999 and, most recently, 12 June 2007. As a result of this, flood-walls were built to keep the water in the channel (River Strule) and to prevent it from overflowing into the flood plain. Large areas of land, mainly around the meanders, are unsuitable for development and were developed into large, green open areas, walking routes and parks.DemographyStatistical Classification - Large Town''Demography -''Population - 19,910Population under 16 years - 24.8%Population over 60 years - 14.9%Average age - 34.0 years (N.I. average - 35.8 years)Male population - 48.9%Female population - 51.1%People from a Catholic community background - 68.2%People from a Protestant or other Christian community background - 29.5%People born outside Northern Ireland - 13.8%People from a non-white ethnic group - 1.2%Population change1981 - 14,627 (Official census)1991 - 17,280 (Official census)2000 - 18,031 (Official estimate)2001 - 19,910 (Official census)2006 - 21,380 (Calculation)2007 - 21,708 (Calculation)2008 - 22,182 (Calculation)World GazeteerPlaces of interestTourist attractionsThe Ulster American Folk Park in Omagh includes the cottage where Thomas Mellon was born in 1813, before emigrating to Pennsylvania, in the United States when he was five.

Creating a modern civic building, in a newly created public space reclaimed from the formerly disused area, between the River Strule and High Street.ParksOmagh boasts over 20 playgrounds for children,Omagh District Council and a large amount of green open area for all the public. The largest (and most well known) of these is the Grange Park, located near the town centre. Many areas around the meanders of the River Strule have also been developed into open areas. Omagh Leisure Complex is a large public amenity, near the Grange Park and is set in 11 hectares (26 acres) of landscaped grounds and features a leisure centre, boating pond, astroturf pitch and cycle paths.RetailOmagh is the main retail centre for Tyrone, as well as the West of Ulster (behind Derry), due to its central location.In the period 2000-2003, over £80 million was invested in Omagh, and 60,960m² (200,000 sq ft) of new retail space was created.Shopping areas in Omagh include the Main Street Mall, Great Northern Road Retail Park and the Showgrounds Retail Park on Sedan Avenue in the town centre. High Street is also a prominent shopping street.There are also supermarkets such as Asda and Super Valu and fast food outlets such as KFC and McDonalds.TransportBusMany bus services link Omagh with the rest of Tyrone and indeed, the rest of Ireland (both North and South). Mainly, two bus companies serve Omagh — Ulsterbus and Bus Éireann. There are bus services to nearly all major towns and cities from Omagh including Derry, Belfast and Dublin. There is a town bus service that runs daily, and a night bus service at weekends. Both services serve the town's suburbs.RailNeither the town nor the district of Omagh has any rail service. The Portadown–Derry main line (also known as "The Derry Road") through Omagh was closed in 1965 and the Omagh Throughpass was built on its trackbed. At the turn of the last century, Omagh was served by four different rail systems which stretched throughout Ireland, into Derry. At the turn of the last century, Clones was one of the major junctions from Derry, Omagh, and Belfast to north Leinster, in particular, the major market towns of Athlone, Cavan, and Mullingar via the Inney junction. This back-bone rail infrastructure was administered by Midland Great Western Railway which also linked to other major centres namely, Sligo, Tullamore, via Clara, other destinations such as Dublin, Limerick, and other market centres of the south coast. Omagh railway station opened on 3 September 1852 and finally closed on 15 February 1965.There is some hope that Omagh will become a transport hub again by 2050. There is a proposal to reopen the rail line to Belfast via Portadown, and also the rail link between Derry and Limerick via Omagh is also planned. However, this is only a proposal in the planning stage, and no plan has been finalised as yet. If this were to happen, Omagh would have rail links for the first time since 1965 to most of the other major towns and cities in Ireland.

People in the town usually use Belfast International Airport, George Best Belfast City Airport, City of Derry Airport and Dublin International Airport.Road connectionsOmagh is connected to the rest of Ireland through a system of A roads and B roads.
