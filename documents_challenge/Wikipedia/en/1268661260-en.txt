It is located in the province of Limburg, at the southeasternmost edge of the country in the municipality of Vaals, near the eponymous town, some three kilometres west of Aachen.Three-Country PointThe Vaalserberg is also noted for being the location where the borders of three countries intersect, giving its summit the name of Drielandenpunt ("Three-Country Point") in Dutch, or Dreiländereck ("Three-Country Corner") in German, or Trois Frontières ("Three Borders") in French.The touching countries are the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Between 1830 and 1919 it even was a Vierlandenpunt or "Four-Country Point"; see Moresnet for the now missing fourth one. This border intersection has made the Vaalserberg a well-known tourist attraction in the Netherlands with a tower on the Belgian side (; French: Tour Baudouin) offering a grand panorama of the surrounding landscape. This tidy and urbanised development stands in marked contrast to the rough cinder parking area that makes up the Belgium sector and the wooded nature reserve on the German side.Four-borders roadThe road leading up to this point on the Dutch side is called the "Viergrenzenweg" ("four-borders road"), probably because of the former neutral Moresnet, while the roads in Belgium "Route des Trois Bornes" and Germany "Dreiländerweg" only refer to three.See Google Maps showing streetnamesReferencesCategory:Mountains and hills of Belgium Category:Mountains and hills of the Netherlands Category:Mountains and hills in North Rhine-Westphaliaca:Vaalserberg cs:Vaalserberg de:Vaalserberg es:Vaalserberg eo:Vaalserberg fr:Vaalserberg fy:Faalserberch id:Vaalserberg it:Vaalserberg he:ואלסרברג nl:Vaalserberg no:Vaalserberg nn:Vaalserberg pl:Vaalserberg ro:Vaalserberg scn:Vaalserberg sk:Vaalserberg sv:Vaalserberg
