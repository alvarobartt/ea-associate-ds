His professional debut on the first team was on July 27 1998 in the Paraguayan Super Clásico against Cerro Porteño, at the age of sixteen. Santa Cruz's club performance led Olimpia Asunción to a Paraguayan championship in 1998 and 1999, and the winning of the Paraguayan Footballer of the Year award.FC Bayern MunichSanta Cruz showed his excellence in Paraguay with Olimpia and the Paraguay national football team, so then got noticed by Bayern which they eventually signed him in the second half of '99. Santa Cruz was unexceptional at Bayern Munich — although he scored five goals in his first season with the club, a series of injuries and heavy competition between forwards for the German giants limited his impact.Nonetheless, he was part of the latest successes for Bayern, winning the German league and cup double, the UEFA Champions League and the European - South American Cup.Blackburn RoversSanta Cruz agreed a four-year deal with Blackburn Rovers on 28 July 2007. Blackburn agreed to pay Bayern Munich £3.5 million for the player. He scored his first goal for Rovers after just three touches of the ball when he came on as a substitute for the injured Benni McCarthy against Middlesbrough in the opening game of the 2007-08 Premier League season. Santa Cruz celebrated his 26th birthday and his first full Rovers start when he scored the winner away to MyPa in the UEFA Cup. Roque Santa Cruz scored his first hat-trick for Blackburn in a 5–3 loss to Wigan Athletic on December 15 2007, becoming the first player in over ten years in English football to score a hat-trick for the losing side, since Dwight Yorke's hat-trick on 30 September 1996 for Aston Villa in their 4–3 away loss to Newcastle United. On 12 January 2008, he was named Premier League "Player of the Month" for December 2007.Following a successful 2007–08 campaign, there was much transfer speculation surrounding Santa Cruz at the start of the 2008–09 season. However, Santa Cruz signed a four-year contract with Blackburn Rovers in August to end the speculation.Roque signs new four year contractClub career statistics(correct as of 27 September 2008)ClubSeasonLeagueCupIncludes FA Cup, League Cup and FA Community Shield.South AmericaEuropeTotalAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsOlimpia Asunción1998–992313----135?3618?Total3618?Bayern Munich1999–00]]285-42----327-2000–01]]195-------195-2001–02]]225----103-328-2002–03]]145-------145-2003–04]]295----81-376-2004–05]]40-------4--2005–06]]134----20-154-2006–07]]262-20-71-353-Total15531-62-275-18838?Blackburn Rovers2007–08]]37197330310432382008–09]]621000000621Total49259National teamParaguay U20Santa Cruz made a name for himself at the 1999 U-20 FIFA World Youth Championship, where he scored three goals for a surprising Paraguay team. His performance there led to a call-up to the full Paraguay national team for the Copa América at the age of 17.Paraguay SeniorSanta Cruz made his senior debut at age 17 for Paraguay at Copa América leading his national team in scoring with three goals. He also scored a total of seven goals in the 2002 and 2006 World Cup qualification rounds, and appeared in the 2002 World Cup, where he scored one goal while helping his team advance to the elimination rounds.Santa Cruz was in doubt for the 2006 World Cup as he was recovering from a serious knee injury. However, he recovered in time for the start of the tournament and played all three group stage matches for Paraguay. Santa Cruz was not able to score a goal, but he did assist Nelson Cuevas and had a good game in the 2–0 victory over Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Despite the win, Paraguay failed to qualify to the second round of the tournament. Santa Cruz scored a hat trick against Colombia in a 5–0 Paraguayan victory during the Copa América 2007 in Venezuela. Currently, he is one of Paraguay's top scorer (three goals) in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.HonoursTitlesSeasonTeamTitle1998]]PAR OlimpiaParaguayan 1st division]]1999]]PAR OlimpiaParaguayan 1st division]]1999-2000]]GER Bayern MunichGerman 1st division]]2000]]GER Bayern MunichGerman Cup]]2001]]GER Bayern MunichUEFA Champions League2000-01]]GER Bayern MunichGerman 1st division]]2001GER Bayern MunichIntercontinental Cup]]2002-03]]GER Bayern MunichGerman 1st division]]2003]]GER Bayern MunichGerman Cup]]2004-05]]GER Bayern MunichGerman 1st division]]2005]]GER Bayern MunichGerman Cup]]2005-06]]GER Bayern MunichGerman 1st division]]2006]]GER Bayern MunichGerman Cup]]AwardsSeasonTeamAward1999PAR OlimpiaParaguayan Footballer of the Year2007ENG Blackburn RoversPremier League player of the month (December)Off the pitchHe married Giselle Tavarelli, the sister of his former national team and Olimpia teammate Ricardo Tavarelli in 2004.
