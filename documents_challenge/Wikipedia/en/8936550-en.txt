Xvid (formerly "XviD") is a video codec library following the MPEG-4 standard. Xvid features MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile features such as b-frames, global and quarter pixel motion compensation, lumi masking, trellis quantization, and H.263, MPEG and custom quantization matrices.Xvid is a primary competitor of the DivX Pro Codec (Xvid being DivX spelled backwards). In contrast with the DivX codec, which is proprietary software developed by DivX, Inc., Xvid is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. This also means that unlike the DivX codec, which is only available for a limited number of platforms, Xvid can be used on all platforms and operating systems for which the source code can be compiled.HistoryIn January 2001, DivXNetworks founded OpenDivX as part of Project Mayo which was intended to be a home for open source multimedia projects. OpenDivX was an open-source MPEG-4 video codec based on a stripped down version of the MoMuSys reference MPEG-4 encoder. The source code, however, was placed under a restrictive license and only members of the DivX Advanced Research Centre (DARC) had write access to the project CVS. In early 2001, DARC member Sparky wrote an improved version of the encoding core called encore2. This was updated several times before, in April, it was removed from CVS without warning. The explanation given by Sparky was "We (our bosses) decided that we are not ready to have it in public yet."DLFP: Interview de l'équipe XviD et sortie de la version 1.0.1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;In July 2001, developers started complaining about a lack of activity in the project; the last CVS commit was several months before, bugfixes were being ignored, and promised documentation had not been written. Soon after, DARC released a beta version of their closed-source commercial DivX 4 codec, which was based on encore2, saying that "what the community really wants is a Winamp, not a Linux."[vorbis&amp;#93; Vorbis ACM codec&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; It was after this that a fork of OpenDivX was created, using the latest version of encore2 that was downloaded before it was removed. Since then, all the OpenDivX code has been replaced and Xvid has been published under the GNU General Public License.Patent issuesAs an implementation of MPEG-4 part 2 Xvid uses many patented technologies.MPEG-4 Visual Patent Portfolio License Cross-Reference Chart (PDF) For this reason, Xvid 0.9.x versions were not licensed in countries where these software patents are enforceable. With the 1.0.x releases, a GNU GPL v2 license is used with no explicit geographical restriction. However, the legal usage of Xvid may still be restricted by local laws.See mailing list discussions http://list.xvid.org/pipermail/xvid-devel/2002-September/000827.html, http://list.xvid.org/pipermail/xvid-devel/2002-November/001316.html, http://list.xvid.org/pipermail/xvid-devel/2002-November/001318.html.Sigma Designs controversyIn July 2002, Sigma Designs released an MPEG-4 video codec called the REALmagic MPEG-4 Video Codec. Before long, people testing this new codec found that it contained considerable portions of Xvid code. Sigma Designs was contacted and confirmed that a programmer had based REALmagic on Xvid, but assured that all GPL code would be replaced to avoid copyright infringement. When Sigma Designs released the supposedly rewritten REALmagic codec, the Xvid developers immediately disassembled it and concluded that it still contained Xvid code, only rearranged in an attempt to disguise its presence. The Xvid developers decided to stop work and go public to force Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. After articles were published in SlashdotSlashdot | Sigma Designs Accused of Copyright Infringement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; and The Inquirer,XVID asks Sigma to stop copyright breach - The INQUIRER&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; in August 2002 Sigma Designs agreed to publish their source code.http://web.archive.org/web/20060314130242/http://www.sigmadesigns.com/news/press_releases/pr_pdf/020822.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Playing Xvid encoded filesDue primarily to concerns over patents, the official Xvid homepage does not provide binary versions of the Xvid codec. Video for Windows codecs (and DirectShow decoding-only filters) for Microsoft Windows are, however, made available at supporting websites. For Linux users, many distributions provide an Xvid codec for use with media players such as MPlayer and VLC. However, all these players use the FFmpeg MPEG-4 decoder by default and therefore don't require (or don't support) decoding with the Xvid codec.Xvid is not a video format. Since Xvid uses MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) compression, video encoded with it is MPEG-4 ASP video (not "Xvid video") and can therefore be decoded with all MPEG-4 ASP compliant decoders. This includes a large number of media players, in particular all the ones based on the free/open source libavcodec library.Xvid encoded files can be written to a CD or DVD and played in a DivX compatible DVD player. However, Xvid can optionally encode video with advanced features that most DivX Certified set-top players do not support. Files encoded with global motion compensation, Qpel, MPEG quantization, multiple B-frames or files that exceed the VBV limitations may not play back properly on DivX Certified hardware devices.For example, Xvid specifies three warp points for its implementation of global motion compensation as opposed to the single warp point implementation of DivX. Enabling some of the more advanced encoding features can compromise player compatibility. Some issues exist with the custom quantization matrices used in tools such as AutoGK that automate encoding with Xvid. This can (depending on the decoder chipset of the set-top player in question) produce videos that have unstable playback and artifacts. However, most recent model DivX compatible DVD players have improved support for custom quantization matrices.A QuickTime Xvid component is available for Mac OS X.Perian - The swiss-army knife of QuickTime® components&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Xiph.Org: QuickTime ComponentsEncoding applicationsOperating systemsSoftwareCommentWindows]]VirtualDub, DVDx, AutoGK etc.And all other applications that support encoding through the VfW framework.Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, and Windows too.Transcode]], Avidemux, VLCvlc and xvid encoding, etc.These platform and framework independent applications access the Xvid library directly.ReferencesSee alsoXvid QfList of codecsComparison of video codecsExternal linksXvid.org web siteXvid Setup/Reference Guide @ Digital DigestXvid Binary Download Page - Links to Windows/Linux binaries on the official siteXvid Source Code Download Page - includes daily snapshots on the official siteCategory:Video codecs Category:Puns Category:Free multimedia codecs, containers, and splitters Category:Cross-platform softwareca:XviD cs:Xvid da:Xvid de:Xvid es:Xvid fr:Xvid gl:Xvid ko:Xvid hr:XviD it:XviD hu:XviD nl:XviD no:Xvid ja:Xvid pl:Xvid pt:XviD ru:Xvid fi:XviD sv:MPEG-4#XviD tr:XviD zh:XviD
