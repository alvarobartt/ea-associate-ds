Paraguay's only major tournament victories have come in the Copa América, in which they triumphed in 1953 and 1979. They also won a silver medal in the football tournament at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, being defeated 1-0 by Argentina in the final.HistoryThe beginning (1900-1930)Soon after the introduction of football in Paraguay by Williams Paats, the Liga Paraguaya de Futbol (today Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol) was created in 1906. The first national football team was organized in 1910 when an invitation by the Argentine club Hércules of Corrientes was received to play a friendly match. Members of that first nationall team where F. Melián, G. Almeida, A. Rodríguez, M. Barrios, P. Samaniego, J. Morín, Z. Gadea, D. Andreani, C. Mena Porta, B. Villamayor, M. Rojas and E. Erico. The match ended in a 0-0 draw. http://www.albirroja.com/history/history2.html&lt;/ref&gt;Because of the increasing number of invitations to play matches and international tournaments, the Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol decided to officially create the national team and select the striped red and white jerseys that until this date remain as the official colours (taken from the Paraguayan flag). In late 1919 Paraguay accepted the invitation to play the 1921 Copa America and in order to prepare for that occasion a number of friendly matches were played between 1919 and the start of the tournament in 1921. The first of those friendly matches was a 5-1 loss against Argentina, and it marked the first international game by the Paraguayan national football team. When the 1921 Copa America finally arrived, Paraguay surprised everybody by beating then three-time South American champions Uruguay by 2-1, being this the first match in an official competition for the Paraguayan football team. Paraguay eventually finished fourth in the tournament and became a regular participant of the tournament for the next editions.In 1930 Paraguay participated in the first World Cup, organized by Uruguay. In the first round, Paraguay debuted and lost to the United States (0-3), to then defeat Belgium (1-0) with a goal by Luis Vargas Peña. Only one team was to advance from the group stage, and the U.S. left Paraguay behind.First taste of success (1930-1970) After good participations in the Copa America tournaments of 1929, 1947 and 1949 (where Paraguay finished in second place), Paraguay was ready for their next World Cup competition.The return to the World Cup was in 1950, where Paraguay faced Sweden and Italy in Group 3. Paraguay failed to advance to the next round after a 2-2 draw against Sweden and a 2-0 loss against Italy.The first big success came in 1953 when Paraguay won the Copa America disputed in Peru. In their road to the championship, Paraguay defeated Chile (3-0), Bolivia (2-1) and Brazil (2-1); and tied against Ecuador (0-0), Peru (2-2) and Uruguay (2-2). Since Paraguay and Brazil were tied in points at the end of the tournament, a final playoff match was played between them, with Paraguay winning the final by 3-2. Key players of the campaign included Angel Berni, Heriberto Herrera and Ruben Fernandez. The coach was Manuel Fleitas Solich.Southamerican Championship 1953&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;For the 1958 World Cup, Paraguay surprisingly qualified ahead of Uruguay (beating them 5-0 in the decisive game) with a team that contained a formidable attacking lineup with stars such as Juan Aguero, Jose Parodi, Juan Romero, Cayetano Ré and Florencio Amarilla. In their first game in Sweden, Paraguay were 3-2 up against France in a game they lost 7-3. A 3-2 win over Scotland and a 3-3 draw with Yugoslavia saw Paraguay finish third in their group.The departure of several of their stars for European football (mainly Spain) resulted in a weakening of Paraguay's football fortunes somewhat, but they were only edged out by Mexico in the 1962 qualifiers.More continental success (1970-1990)Paraguay fell short in subsequent World Cup qualifying campaigns, but Copa América success (and that of one of its premier clubs Olimpia in the Copa Libertadores) in 1979 shored up Paraguay as a solid player on the continent.The 1979 Copa América was won by Paraguay after finishing first in Group C (which had Uruguay and Ecuador as well) with two wins and two draws. In the semi-finals Paraguay defeated Brazil by an aggregate score of 4-3. In the finals, Paraguay defeated Chile by an aggregate score of 3-1 to claim its second continental crown. Players such as Julio Cesar Romero (Romerito), Carlos Alberto Kiese, Alicio Solalinde, Roberto Paredes, Hugo Ricardo Talavera and Eugenio Morel where an important part of the team, coached by Ranulfo Miranda.Copa América 1979&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Paraguay ended a 28-year absence from the World Cup in 1986 with a team starring Roberto &quot;Gato&quot; Fernandez in goal; Cesar Zavala, Rogelio Delgado and Juan Bautista Torales in defense; Jorge Amado Nunes and Vladimiro Chetinna in midfield; midfield playmaker Romerito and strikers Roberto Cabañas, Ramon Angel Maria Hicks and Rolando Chilavert (older brother of Jose Luis Chilavert). In first round matches, Paraguay defeated Iraq (1-0, goal Romerito) and then tied Mexico (1-1, goal Romerito) and Belgium (2-2, both goals Roberto Cabañas). They reached the second round where they were beaten 3-0 by England.  http://www.albirroja.com/history/history6.html&lt;/ref&gt;The golden generation (1990-2006)A drought followed once again, as Paraguay failed to reach the Italy 1990 and U.S. 1994 World Cups.In 1992, Paraguay won the South American Pre-Olympic tournament, which guaranteed a spot in the 1992 Summer Olympics football competition. In the Olympics, Paraguay finished second in its group and were eliminated by Ghana in the quarterfinals. The most important aspect of that Paraguay team was the emergence of new young players like Carlos Gamarra, Celso Ayala, Jose Luis Chilavert, Francisco Arce and Jose Cardozo, which became part of the "golden generation" that led Paraguay to three straight World Cups and good performances in continental competitions, establishing Paraguay as one of the top teams in South America along Brazil and Argentina.This new generation of players helped end the World Cup drought in grand fashion, as the Albirroja reached the France 1998 World Cup by qualifying in second place in South America behind Argentina. The first round matches were against Bulgaria (0-0), Spain (0-0), and Nigeria (3-1; goals Celso Ayala, Miguel Angel Benitez and Jose Cardozo). Paraguay qualified to the second round (Round of 16) to be defeated in a thrilling match against would-be World Champions France. France only scored through Laurent Blanc in the 114th minute, during the second half of overtime (making it the first golden goal scored in a World Cup). Paraguay's central defending duo (Carlos Gamarra and Celso Ayala) and goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert were selected for the all-star World Cup team.Paraguay returned to the World’s greatest stage once more in the 2002 World Cup. In their first match, Paraguay tied South Africa 2-2 (goals: Roque Santa Cruz and Francisco Arce). Paraguay lost to Spain in the second game (1-3) and finally defeated Slovenia (3-1; goals Nelson Cuevas, twice, and Jorge Luis Campos) to qualify for the second round. Germany ended Paraguay’s dreams in the World Cup with an 88 minute goal.In 2006, Paraguay qualified for its third World Cup in a row. This time, two early defeats against England and Sweden (both 0-1) sent the team home early. The only consolation was defeating Trinidad and Tobago during the last and final group game by 2-0.The presentAfter the 2006 World Cup, Anibal Ruiz resigned as head coach and Raul Vicente Amarilla was assigned as the interim coach. In 2007, Argentine Gerardo "Tata" Martino was designated as head-coach. The former Newell's Old Boys (Rosario, Argentina) skipper's coaching career had blossomed in Paraguay where he formerly coached Libertad and Cerro Porteño. He was a clear and logical choice for the Paraguayan FA.Paraguay's current squad is undergoing a transition because of the retirement of key players such as Carlos Gamarra, Francisco Arce , Celso Ayala, and goalkeeper José Luis Chilavert. Paraguay's under-19 side won the Milk Cup in 2002, 2003 and 2006, and players such as Nelson Valdez, Julio Dos Santos, José Montiel and Oscar Cardozo are thought key to the re-building of the team.Currently the squad coached by Gerardo &quot;Tata&quot; Martino is leading the standings in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup.The usual starting line-up during the qualifiers has been with: Justo Villar at goal; Roberto Bonet or Denis Caniza on the right, Da Silva and Julio Caceres in the middle, Claudio Morel on the left. In the midfield, "Topo" Caceres and Christian Riveros have been playing in the center, while Barreto and Jonathan Santana play on the outsides. Up front, it has been Salvador Cabañas, Roque Santa Cruz alternating with Cardozo and Nelson Haedo Valdez. Carlos Humberto Paredes is expected to return to the starting line-up in midfield in June.World Cup record1930 - Round 11934 - Did not enter1938 - Did not enter1950 - Round 11954 - Did not qualify1958 - Round 11962 to 1982 - Did not qualify1986 - Round 21990 - Did not qualify1994 - Did not qualify1998 - Round 22002 - Round 22006 - Round 1Olympic Games record&lt;ref name=&quot;Olympics 1992-&quot; /&gt;1992 - Quarterfinals2004 - Silver Medal (Second place)Copa América record&nbsp;Pan American Games record1951 - Fifth place1955 to 1983 - Did not compete1987 - Round 11991 - Did not compete1995 - Quarterfinals1999 - Did not compete2003 - Round 12007 - Did not competeMost Paraguay capsPlayerParaguay careerCaps (Goals)Carlos Gamarra1993-2006110 (12)Roberto Acuña1993-200697 (5)Celso Ayala1993-200385 (6)José Saturnino Cardozo1991-200682 (25)Denis Caniza1996-200679 (1)Roberto Fernández1976-198978 (0)Juan Bautista Torales1979-198977 (1)José Luis Chilavert1989-200374 (8)Estanislao Struway1991-200274 (4)Carlos Humberto Paredes1998-present72 (10)Julio César Enciso1995-200470 (2)Top Paraguay goalscorersPlayerParaguay careerGoals (Caps)José Saturnino Cardozo1991-200625 (82)Roque Santa Cruz1999-present20 (61)Saturnino Arrúa1969-198013 (26)Julio César Romero1979-198613 (32)Gerardo Rivas1921-192612 (32)Carlos Gamarra1993-200612 (110)Miguel Angel Benítez1996-199911 (29)Juan Bautista Villalba1945-194710 (22)Aurelio González1924-193710 (23)Carlos Humberto Paredes1998-present10 (72)Famous playersFrancisco ArceRoberto Miguel AcuñaSaturnino ArrúaCelso AyalaRoberto CabañasSalvador CabañasJulio César CáceresNelson CuevasJosé Saturnino CardozoJosé Luis ChilavertArsenio EricoRoberto &quot;El Gato&quot; FernándezCarlos GamarraAurelio GonzálezNelson Haedo ValdezCarlos Humberto ParedesEugenio MorelClaudio Morel RodríguezRomeritoRoque Santa CruzJuan Bautista VillalbaJusto VillarNotable coaches Aurelio González Manuel Fleitas Solich Ranulfo Miranda Cayetano Ré   Ladislao Kubala Paulo César Carpegiani Sergio MarkariánCurrent team statusParaguay is currently participating in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. 2010 FIFA World Cup &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Qualification Standings&lt;/small&gt;expanded = yesfixtures = yesLast and next gamesLast game:  2 - 0  - Asunción, Paraguay - September 9, 2008 - WCQ2010.Next game:  - Bogotá, Colombia - October 11, 2008 - WCQ2010.KEY: F = Friendly match; WCQ2010 = 2010 FIFA World Cup qualificationCurrent squadThe following players were called for the friendly match against France on May 31 2008.    |----- ! colspan="9" bgcolor="#B0D3FB" align="left" | |----- bgcolor="#DFEDFD"         |----- ! colspan="9" bgcolor="#B0D3FB" align="left" | |----- bgcolor="#DFEDFD"        |----- ! colspan="9" bgcolor="#B0D3FB" align="left" | |----- bgcolor="#DFEDFD"        Recent Call UpsThe following players have also been called up to the Paraguay squad in 2008.GoalkeepersNameDate of birthClubCaps (goals)Most Recent Call upDerlis GomezNovember 2 1972Paraguay Nacional8 (0)Japan]], 27 May, 2008Horacio GonzálezJuly 2 1973Paraguay Libertad?
