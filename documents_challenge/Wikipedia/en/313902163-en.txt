 MeshID         = D014657 | Vasculitis (plural: vasculitides), a group of diseases featuring inflammation of the wall of blood vessels including veins (phlebitis), arteries (arteritis) and capillaries due to leukocyte migration and resultant damage. While most vasculitides are rare, they generally affect several organ systems and can cause severe disability.ClassificationVasculitides can be classified by the size of the blood vessel that they predominantly affect.Large vessel vasculitisTakayasu arteritis. Primarily affects the aorta and its main branches. At least 3 out of 6 criteria yields sensitivity and specificity of 90.5 and 97.8%:onset  4 kglivedo reticularistesticular painmyalgias, weaknessAbdominal pain,diarrhia,and GI bleedingmononeuropathy or polyneuropathynew onset diastolic blood pressure  90 mmHgelevated serum BUN ( 40 mg/dL) or serum creatinine ( 1.5 mg/dL)hepatitis B infectionarteriographic abnormalitiesarterial biopsy showing polymorphonuclear cellsWegener's granulomatosis. Systemic vasculitis of medium and small arteries, including venules and arterioles. Produces granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tracts and necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Most common cause of saddle nose deformity in USA (nose flattened due to destruction of nasal septum by granulomatous inflammation). Almost all patients with WG have c-ANCA, but not vice versa. Current treatment of choice is cyclophosphamide. At least 2 out of 4 criteria yields sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 92%.nasal or oral inflammation (oral ulcers or purulent/bloody nasal discharge, may be painful)abnormal CXR showing nodules, infiltrates, cavitiesmicroscopic hematuria or RBC castsvessel biopsy shows granulomatous inflammationPeak incidence: ages 40-60 ,males  femalesKawasaki disease. Usually in children(age 1.5 cm)Isolated CNS vasculitis. Affects medium and small arteries over a diffuse CNS area, without symptomatic extracranial vessel involvement. Patients have CNS symptoms as well as cerebral vasculitis by angiography and leptomeningeal biopsy.Small vessel vasculitisThere are several vasculitides that affect small vessels.Churg-Strauss arteritis. Affects medium and small vessels with vascular and extravascular granulomatosis. Classically involves arteries of lungs and skin, but may be generalized. At least 4 criteria yields sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 99.7%.asthma (history of wheezeing or presently wheezing)eosinophilia  10% on CBCmononeuropathy or polyneuropathymigratory or transient pulmonary opacities on chest x-ray (CXR)paranasal sinus abnormalitiesvessel biopsy showing eosinophils in extravascular areasMicroscopic polyarteritis/polyangiitis. Affects capillaries, venules, or arterioles. Thought to be part of a group that includes Wegeners since both are associated with ANCA and similar extrapulmonary manifestations. Patients do not usually have symptomatic or histologic respiratory involvement.Hypersensitivity vasculitis (allergic vasculitis). Usually due to a hypersensitivity reaction to a known drug. Drugs most commonly implicated are penicillin, sulphonamides and thiazide diuretics.Axford J, O'Callaghan C, (eds). 2004. Medicine. Oxford. Blackwell Publishing.There is presence of skin vaculitis with palpable petechiae or purpura. Biopsy of these lesions reveal inflammation of the small vessels, termed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is most prominent in postcapillary venules. At least 3 out of 5 criteria yields sensitivity and specificity of 71 and 84%:age  16use of possible triggering drug in relation to symptomspalpable purpuramaculopapular rashskin biopsy showing neutrophils around vesselHenoch-Schonlein purpura. Systemic vasculitis due to tissue deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes. Biopsy of lesions shows inflammation of small vessels. It is considered a form of hypersensitivity vasculitis but is distinguished by prominent deposits of IgA. This is the most common vasculitis in children. Presence of 3 or more criteria yielded sensitivity of 87% while less than 2 criteria yielded hypersensitivity vasculitis in 74%:palpable purpura (usually of buttocks & legs)bowel anginaGI bleedhematuriaonset ReferencesExternal linksVasculitis FoundationEuropean Vasculitis Study GroupJohns Hopkins Vasculitis Center    Category:Rheumatology Category:Inflammationsde:Vaskulitis es:Vasculitis fr:Vascularite it:Vasculite hu:Érgyulladás nl:Vasculitis ja:血管炎 no:Vaskulitt pl:Układowe zapalenia naczyń pt:Vasculite ru:Васкулит fi:Vaskuliitti sv:Kärlinflammation
