It is able to stream over networks and to transcode multimedia files and save them into various different formats. VLC used to stand for VideoLAN Client, but that meaning is now deprecated. It is one of the most platform-independent players available, with versions for BeOS, Syllable, BSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, MorphOS and Solaris, and is widely used with over 100 million downloads for version 0.8.6.VLC includes a large number of free decoding and encoding libraries; on the Windows platform, this greatly reduces the need for finding/calibrating proprietary plugins. Many of VLC's codecs are provided by the libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project, but it uses mainly its own muxer and demuxers. It also gained distinction as the first player to support playback of encrypted DVDs on Linux by using the libdvdcss DVD decryption library.Version 0.9.2, which features a new interface and adds support for new codecs was released on 15 September 2008.HistoryOriginally the VideoLAN project was intended to consist of a client and server to stream videos across a network. Originally developed by students at the École Centrale Paris, it is now developed by contributors worldwide. VLC was the client for the VideoLAN project, with VLC standing for VideoLAN Client. It was released under the GPL on February 1, 2001. The functionality of the server program, VideoLAN Server (VLS), has mostly been subsumed into VLC and has been discontinued. The project name was changed to VLC media player since there is no longer a client/server infrastructure.The cone icon used in VLC is a reference to the traffic cones collected by Ecole Centrale's Networking Students' Association. The cone icon design was changed from a hand drawn low resolution icon to a higher resolution CGI rendered version in 2006.Design principlesinterface, running on KDE]]  interface, running on Mac OS X]]  Gutsy (detailed information on this image's page)]]VLC has a very modular design which makes it easier to include modules for new file formats, codecs or streaming methods. This principle also stretches to other areas and there is a wide selection of interfaces, video and audio outputs, controls, and audio and video filter modules. There are more than 360 modules in VLC.InterfacesThe standard GUI is based on Qt 4 for Windows and Linux, Cocoa for Mac OS X, and Be API on BeOS; but all give a similar standard interface. The old standard GUI was based on wx on Windows and Linux.VideoLAN Client(VLC) supports highly customizable skins through the skins2 interface, also supporting Winamp 2 and XMMS skins. The customizable skins feature can malfunction depending on which version is being used.For console users, VLC has an ncurses interface. As VLC can act as a streaming server, rather than a media player, it can be useful to control it from a remote location and there are interfaces allowing this. The Remote Control Interface is a text-based interface for doing this. There are also interfaces using telnet and HTTP (AJAX).ControlIn addition to these interfaces, it is possible to control VLC in different ways:configurable hotkeysmouse gesturesLIRC and infrared controllersFeaturesVLC is popular for its ability to play the video content of incomplete, unfinished, or damaged video downloads before the files have been fully downloaded. (For example, files still downloading via BitTorrent, eMule, or Gnutella). It also plays m2t MPEG Transport Streams (.TS) files while they are still being digitized from an HDV camera via a FireWire cable, making it possible to monitor the video as it is being played. This is because it is a packet-based player.The player also has the ability to use libcdio to access .iso files so that the user can play files on a disk image, even if the user's operating system does not have the capability of working directly with .iso images.VLC supports all codecs and all file formats supported by FFmpeg. This means that DVD Video and MPEG-4 playback as well as support for Ogg and Matroska (MKV) file formats work "out of the box". However, this feature is not unique to VLC, as any player using the FFmpeg libraries, including MPlayer and xine-lib-based players, can play those formats without need for external codecs. VLC also supports codecs that are not included in FFmpeg.VLC media player has some filters that can distort, rotate, split, deinterlace, mirror videos, create display walls, or add a logo overlay. It can also produce video output as ASCII art.VLC media player can play high definition recordings of D-VHS tapes duplicated to a computer using CapDVHS.exe. This offers another way to archive all D-VHS tapes with the DRM copy freely tag. An entire library of tapes (or about 50 D-VHS 2 hours long) can be placed on a single terabyte sized hard drive. However, they must be imported by playing the tapes in real time, and can't simply be copied as data files.Using a FireWire connection from cable boxes to computers, VLC can stream live, unencrypted content to a monitor or HDTV.VLC media player can display the playing video as the desktop wallpaper, like Windows DreamScene, but this feature is not currently available on Linux.VLC media player can do screencast and record the desktop.On Microsoft Windows, VLC also supports the Direct Media Object (DMO) framework and can therefore make use of some third-party DLLs.Use of VLC with other programsAPI | latest release version = | latest release date = | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = C | operating system = Cross-platform | platform = Native, .NET, Java, Python and Cocoa | size = | language = multilingual | status = | genre = Multimedia Library | license = GNU General Public License | website = http://wiki.videolan.org/Libvlc   There are several APIs that can connect to VLC and use its functionality:libVLC API, which is the VLC Core, for C, C++ and C#.JavaScript API, which is the evolution of ActiveX API and Firefox integration.D-Bus Controls.C# interface.Python controls.Java APIJava binding Project.DirectShow filters.&lt;/ref&gt;Browser pluginsOn Windows, Linux, and some other platforms, VLC provides a NPAPI plugin,Chapter 4.
