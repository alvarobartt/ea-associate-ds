Controversy following op-ed on Israel and JudaismSee Jostein Gaarder controversyIn August 2006, Jostein Gaarder published an op-ed in one of the major daily newspapers in Norway, Aftenposten. This was written in response to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict and condemned certain aspects of Israeli politics and Judaism. Gaarder also argued against recognizing the state of Israel in its current form. The article was accused of promoting antisemitic sentiments, such as describing Judaism as "an archaic national and warlike religion", contrasting it with the "Christian" idea that "The Kingdom of God is compassion and forgiveness". Gaarder disputed the allegations of antisemitism, and sought to clarify that he didn't mean to offend anyone. He claimed that the piece was written in a state of moral outrage over the death toll in Lebanon. Like his initial piece, his attempts at clarification met with mixed reactions.Quotes"The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder." (from Sophie's World)"It's fun at the Tivoli, and it's fun with a carousel, but sometimes I get the urge to jump off.""There exists a world. In terms of probability, this borders on the impossible."
