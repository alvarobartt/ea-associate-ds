While Feyenoord are the team of hard working no-nonsense players with guts, anti-heroes that put their money where their mouth is and fight for every ball contact Ajax on the other hand are a team of self-assured players, creative artists which most of the time have more technical skills. People from Rotterdam dislike Amsterdam, while people from Amsterdam dislike Rotterdam. Where Amsterdam attracts many tourists from all over the world, for their canals, but also for their historical buildings which survived World War II, Rotterdam was bombed and hardly attracts tourists at all. Amsterdam is seen as an arrogant city; Sparta Rotterdam fan Jules Deelder (nicknamed 'the Night Governor of Rotterdam') once said "Holland's money is earned in Rotterdam, divided in The Hague and flushed down the toilet in Amsterdam." In times one of the two teams underperforms in the league, the meeting between the two teams is still considered to be the biggest game of the season. Stadiums are always packed, the matches get a lot of media attention and high emotions among fans occur. Positive, but also negative emotions; In the past there have been many clashes between the supporters of both clubs, of which the Beverwijk clash in 1997 is the most infamous, with Ajax fan Carlo Picornie being killed and several others injured.

The rivalry between Sparta and Feyenoord is mostly seen on the Sparta side.Gratis naar binnen op Zuid, itwm.nl Some Sparta fans reject to ever enter Feyenoord stadium De Kuip, not even when Sparta reached the KNVB Cup final which was played in De Kuip. Sparta fans often say "Only when De Kuip is burning I will go there to have a look". "I will help the fire fighters, but with benzin(gas)instead of water". Other Sparta fans say they will enter De Kuip, but only if they can get in for three shillings. In the 1950s there was much more of a rivalry. One of the key factors for these feelings were created among player Tinus Bosselaar.Feitjes en weetjes over Feyenoord, sportgeschiedenis.nl Bosselaar was a player who played for the Dutch national team who moved from Sparta to Feyenoord in 1954. In his period at Feyenoord he performed that good, that Sparta wanted him to return to the club. Feyenoord took Sparta to court to avoid him leaving the club, but lost the case and Bosselaar left the club. A song about the rivalry between the two teams describes the last hours in the life of an eighty year old lifetime Feyenoord fan who tells his friend to become a member of Sparta before he dies. The reason becomes clear in the last part of the song as he tells his friend he rather sees a dead Sparta fan than a dead Feyenoord fan.Famous Feyenoord players Netherlands Aad Bak Mario Been Rinus Bennaars Regi Blinker George Boateng Johan Boskamp Paul Bosvelt Peter Bosz Frans Bouwmeester Stanley Brard Giovanni van Bronckhorst Richard Budding Ellery Cairo Romeo Castelen Johan Cruijff Joop van Daele Jan van Deinsen Royston Drenthe Theo van Duivenbode Henk Duut Henk Fräser Jean-Paul van Gastel Ruud Geels Cor van der Gijp Ulrich van Gobbel Ed de Goey Ruud Gullit Jonathan De Guzman Guus Haak Willem van Hanegem Puck van Heel Joop van der Heide Ruud Heus Joop Hiele André Hoekstra René Hofman Pierre van Hooijdonk Peter Houtman Rinus Israël Wim Jansen Theo de Jong Gerard Kerkum Ronald Koeman Bert Konterman Adriaan Koonings Hans Kraay Reinier Kreijermaat Piet Kruiver Dirk Kuyt Theo Laseroms Jan Linssen Patrick Lodewijks John van Loen Roy Makaay Toon Meerman John Metgod Keje Molenaar Coen Moulijn Bas Paauwe Patrick Paauwe Robin van Persie Eddy Pieters Graafland Kees Pijl Peter Ressel Wim Rijsbergen Kees Rijvers Piet Romeijn Dick Schneider Lex Schoenmaker Arnold Scholten Henk Schouten Bernard Schuiteman André Stafleu Piet Steenbergen Simon Tahamata Gaston Taument Wim van Til Eddy Treijtel Sjaak Troost Orlando Trustfull Cor Veldhoen Leen Vente Pierre Vermeulen Henk Vos Peter van Vossen Manus Vrauwdeunt Arie de Vroet Henk Wery Ben Wijnstekers Rob Witschge Rini van Woerden John de Wolf Kees van WonderenArgentina Mariano Bombarda Julio Ricardo Cruz Patricio Graff Pablo SánchezAustralia Brett Emerton Aurelio Vidmar Dave Mitchell Brett HolmanAustria Franz Hasil Willy KreuzBelgium Thomas Buffel Benjamin de Ceulaer Geoffrey Claeys Pieter Collen Timothy Derijck Bart Goor Stein Huysegems Philippe Léonard Gill SwertsBermuda Clyde BestBrazil Leonardo Santiago Leonardo dos Santos Tininho André BahiaBulgaria Andrey ZhelyazkovChile Sebastián Pardo Jorge AcuñaCzech Republic Stanislav GrigaDenmark Ivan Nielsen Jon Dahl Tomasson Jørgen Kristensen Lars ElstrupEgypt Hossam GhalyFinland Joonas KolkkaGeorgia Georgi DemetradzeGhana Christian GyanGreece Angelos CharisteasHungary József Kiprich Antal Róth Gábor BabosIceland Petur Petursson Arnar GunnlaugssonIreland David ConnollyIvory Coast Bonaventure Kalou Salomon KalouJapan Shinji OnoKorea Lee Chun-Soo Song Chong-GugMorocco Ali Boussaboun Karim El AhmadiNigeria Mike ObikuNorway Roger AlbertsenPoland Jerzy Dudek Tomasz Rząsa Euzebiusz Smolarek Włodzimierz Smolarek Tomasz Iwan Michał JanotaRomania Marian Damaschin Ioan SabăuRussia Igor KorneyevSweden Johan Elmander Ove Kindvall Henrik LarssonTurkey Nuri ŞahinUruguay Fernando PicunUSA Cory GibbsYugoslavia Mladen RamljakFeyenoord managersFeyenoord have had managers from all over Europe.
