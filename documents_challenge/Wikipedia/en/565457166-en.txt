   ]]Der Erlkönig (often called just Erlkönig) is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It depicts the death of a child assailed by a supernatural being, the "Erlkönig" (or "erlking", roughly translated as "evil spirit"). It was originally composed by Goethe as part of a 1782 ballad opera entitled Die Fischerin.The poem has been used as the text for lieder (art songs for voice and piano) by many classical composers, the most famous undoubtedly being that of Franz Schubert, his Opus 1 (D. 328). Many other settings survive. contains a selective list of 14 settings of the poem lists 23 settings of the poem Other notable settings are by members of Goethe's circle, including the actress Corona Schröter (1782), Andreas Romberg (1793), Johann Friedrich Reichardt (1794) and Carl Friedrich Zelter (1797). Beethoven attempted to set it to music but abandoned the effort; his sketch however was complete enough to be published in a completion by Reinhold Becker (1897). A few other nineteenth-century versions are those by Václav Jan Tomášek (1815), Carl Löwe (1818) and Ludwig Spohr (1856, with obligato violin).Later contemporary musical interpretations of the poem have been done by other German artists: Christian Brückner, who is a well-known actor and voice in Germany, lent his voice for a track called Earlkings legacy which was produced in cooperation with BAD EGGZ in 2002. Another version was done by Hypnotic Grooves (featuring Jo Van Nelson).Summary  Goethe's poem begins with a young boy being brought to his home by his father. The meaning is somewhat ambiguous, as the word "Hof" has the rather generic meaning of "yard" or "place". In this case it is a shortcut of "court" or, more likely, "farmyard" (though "der Bauernhof" is the literal word for a farmyard). The ambiguity about the father's social rank is quite acceptable because any father would have similar feelings about a son (or daughter) so ill and in pain.The poem begins by giving the impression that the child is simply dying from a vague, unspecified ailment and sees death as a figment of his imagination. As it proceeds, the poem takes an ever darker twist, and ends with the child's death.One story has it that Goethe was visiting a friend when, late one night, a dark figure carrying a bundle in its arms was seen riding past the gate at high speed. The next day Goethe and his friend were told that they had seen a farmer taking his sick son to the doctor. This incident (along with the legend) is said to have been the main inspiration for the poem.Some readers, visualising the father's embrace of his ailing son, may assume that the child is sick and in need of medical attention. However, the poem's characterisation of the child's condition is ambiguous.TextOriginal GermanEnglish TranslationWho rides there so late through the night dark and drear?The legendThe legend of the Erlkönig appears to have originated in fairly recent times in Denmark, and Goethe based his poem on "Erlkönigs Tochter" ("Erlkönig's Daughter"), a Danish work translated into German by Johann Gottfried Herder. It appeared as "The Elf King's Daughter" in his collection of folk songs, Stimmen der Völker in Liedern (published 1778). Niels Gade's cantata Elverskud opus 30 (1854, text by Chr. K. F. Molbech) was published in translation as Erlkönigs Tochter.The Erlkönig's nature has been the subject of some debate. The name translates literally from the German as "Alder King" rather than its common English translation, "Elf King" (which would be rendered as Elfenkönig or Elbenkönig in German). It has often been suggested that Erlkönig is a mistranslation from the original Danish ellerkonge or elverkonge, which does mean "elf king."According to German and Danish folklore, the Erlkönig appears as an omen of death, much like the banshee in Irish mythology. Unlike the banshee, however, the Erlkönig will appear only to the person about to die. His form and expression also tell the person what sort of death he or she will have: a pained expression means a painful death, while a peaceful expression means a peaceful death.Another interpretation suggests that Erlkönig is based on the legend that whoever is touched by the king of the elves must die.The Franz Schubert composition[[Image:ErlkoenigSchubertManuscriptPage.png|right|thumb|The first manuscript page of Schubert's Der Erlkönig]] Franz Schubert composed his Lied Erlkönig in 1815 for solo voice and piano, with text from the Goethe poem. Schubert revised it three times before publishing his fourth version in 1821 as his Opus 1; it was cataloged by Otto Erich Deutsch as D.328 in his 1951 catalog of Schubert's works. It was first performed in concert on December 1, 1820, at a private gathering in Vienna, and received its public premiere on March 7, 1821, at Vienna's Theater am Kärntnertor.Four characters &mdash; narrator, father, son, and the Erlking &mdash; are all sung by one vocalist normally, but the work has been performed by four separate singers on occasion. Schubert has placed each character in largely a different vocal range and each has his own rhythmic nuances; in addition, most vocalists endeavor to use a different vocal color for each one.The Narrator lies in the middle range and is in minor mode.The Father lies in the low range and sings both in minor mode and major modeThe Son lies in a high range, also in minor mode, representing the fright of the child.The Erlking's vocal line undulates up and down to arpeggiated accompaniment resulting in striking contrast and is in the major mode. The Erlking lines are typically sung pianissimo, portraying a sneaky persuasiveness.A fifth character, the horse, is implied in rapid triplet figures played by the pianist throughout the work, mimicking hoof beatsMachlis, Joseph and Forney, Kristine. "Schubert and the Lied" The Enjoyment of Music: An Introduction to Perceptive Listening. 9th Ed. W.W. Norton & Company: 2003.Erlkönig starts with the piano rapidly playing octaves to create a horror theme and triplets of a repeated note to simulate the horse's galloping; this motif continues throughout. Each of the son's pleas grows louder and higher pitched than the previous ones. Near the very end of the piece the music quickens (as the father desperately tries to spur his horse to go faster), slows down (as he arrives), and the piano stops before the final line, "In seinen Armen das Kind war tot" (In his arms the child was dead). The piece then ends with a dramatic perfect cadence.The piece is regarded as extremely challenging to perform due to the vocal characterization required of the vocalist as well as its difficult accompaniment, involving the playing of rapidly repeated chords and octaves to create the drama and urgency in the poetry.The accompaniment has been orchestrated twice, by Hector Berlioz and by Franz Liszt.The Carl Löwe compositionLöwe's setting was published as Op 1 no 3 and composed in 1817-18, in the lifetime of the poem's author and also of Schubert, whose version Löwe did not then know. Collected with it were op 1 no 1, Edward (1818), (a translation of the Scottish ballad), and no 2, Der Wirthin Töchterlein (1823), (The Innkeeper's daughter), a poem of Ludwig Uhland. Inspired by a German translation of Scottish border ballads, Löwe set several poems with an elvish theme; but although all three of Op 1 are concerned with untimely death, in this set only the Erlkönig has the supernatural element.Löwe's accompaniment is in semiquaver groups of six in nine-eight time (as against Schubert's quaver triplets in common time) and marked Geschwind. The vocal line evokes the galloping effect by repeated figures of crotchet and quaver, or sometimes three quavers, overlying the binary tremolo of the semiquavers in the piano. In addition to an unusual sense of motion this creates a very flexible template for the stresses in the words to fall correctly within the rhythmic structure.Löwe's version is less lyrically melodic than Schubert's, with an insistent, repetitive harmonic structure between the opening minor key, and answering phrases in the major key of the dominant, which have a stark quality owing to their unusual relationship to the home key. The narrator's phrases are echoed by the voices of father and son, the father taking up the deeper, rising phrase, and the son a lightly undulating, answering theme around the dominant. These two themes also evoke the rising and moaning of the wind.Into this structure issues the very ghostly voice of the Elf king, who sings always pianissimo and diminuendo, in rising figures in the home key, but in the major, over an una corda tremolo. This very simple figure, rising from the dominant through the major triad, repeated four times with very minor variation in each of the three calls of the Elf king to the child, has an eerie and elfin quality like the very distant blowing of a horn. As he and the child become more urgent the first in the groups of three quavers are dotted to create a breathless pace, which then forms a bass figure in the piano driving through to the final crisis. The last words, war tot, leap from the lower dominant to the sharpened third of the home key, this time not to the major but to a diminished chord, which settles chromatically through the home key in the major and then to the minor.This is a dynamic, dramatic and original setting of the full text, considered by some to rival the Schubert version. Löwe performed his own songs, and the original in G minor was for his tenor voice.TriviaThe fictional annotator of Vladimir Nabokov's novel Pale Fire offers a Zemblese translation of the opening lines: Ret woren ok spoz on natt ut vett?/ Eto est votchez ut mid ik dett. (note on line 662)The Rammstein song Dalai Lama from the album Reise, Reise is a modernized version of the poem, taking place on an airplane.The Heavy metal band Pagan Altar's song "The Erl-King" was inspired by the Goethe poem.The neofolk band Forseti has a song called Erlkönig that uses the poem as lyrics.The PlayStation Portable game Work Time Fun features a mini-game based on the poem, which plays the Schubert composition with Japanese lyrics as background music.In the 1988 film Burning Secret, Baron Alexander recites the final lines of Goethe's poem while holding the boy Edmund in a swimming pool (water itself being a symbol of birth and death). This moment represents the high point of their affection, whereafter the baron turns his attentions elsewhere. Here the quote also suggests the death of a child as such, on the way to maturity.In his celebrated novel Le Roi des Aulnes (1970), Michel Tournier identified the Erlkönig with his protagonist, and in turn with the German people during World War II, in the deliberate appeal the Nazis made to youth, ultimately sending them to their deaths in battle.The Volker Schlöndorff film The Ogre is an adaptation of Tournier's story. The film tells the story of a French soldier in World War II, John Malkovich, who is taken prisoner by the Germans and begins recruiting young peasant boys for the Hitler Youth.The song "Erlkoenig" by Waldorf is a lyrical adaptation of the poem, with minor changes to fit within a song. Unlike the poem- which ends with death- the song ends with the child being taken away by the Elf King's daughters, where they dance and sing him to sleep for all eternity.The British classical crossover singer Sarah Brightman released the song "Figlio Perduto" (Lost Son) in 2000 in her album "La Luna." The song is an Italian translation by Chiara Ferrau of Goethe's poem.Singer/songwriter Josh Ritter translated and set the poem to music under the name "The Oak Tree King" for his concert series with violinist Hilary HahnThe E Nomine song "Die Schwarzen Reiter" begins with the line "Who rides so late through the night and wind?" (but in German), an obvious reference to the poem.A short story entitled The Erl-King written by Elizabeth Hand is inspired by the Goethe poem but is set in modern day. It first appeared in the anthology Full Spectrum 4 in 1993.Theatre de Complicite use the poem in The Street of Crocodiles, a piece of theatre based on the stories of Bruno SchulzJim Butcher's novel Dead Beat refers to a fictitious "Die Lied Der Erlking" [sic], a fictitious recollection of poems about the Erlkönig carrying an incorrect German title, as a part of its central plot.Canadian Indie rock musicians Ghost Bees released the song "Erl King" on their 2008 album "Tasseomancy".NotesReferencesExternal linksDietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings Schubert's &quot;Erlkönig,&quot; accompanied by Gerald Moore (YouTube video)Songwriter Josh Ritter performs his translation of the poem, titled &quot;The Oak King&quot; (YouTube video)&quot;Erlkönig&quot; at Emily Ezust's Lied and Art Song Texts Page; another translation and list of settingsMusical version of the Schubert Lied - free recording (mp3) and free scoreaudio of Schubert's setting of Erlkönig in MP3 formatFull score and MIDI file of Schubert's setting of Erlkönig from MutopiaGoethe and the &quot;Erlkönig&quot; Myth[http://www.the-egg.de/Earlkings%20Legacy.wma audio for Earlkings legacy], performed by Christian Brückner was produced by BAD-EGGZ in 2002.A comparison of Rammstein's Dalai Lama to the original poem Category:Ballads Category:Poetry by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Category:Compositions by Franz Schubertbg:Горски цар (балада) de:Erlkönig (Ballade) es:Der Erlkönig fr:Le Roi des aulnes (poème) nl:Erlkönig ja:魔王 (ゲーテ) no:Alvekongen pl:Król Elfów ru:Лесной царь (стихотворение) fi:Erlkönig
