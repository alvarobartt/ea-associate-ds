  Dietrich Bonhoeffer  (February 4, 1906 &ndash; April 9, 1945) was a German Lutheran pastor, theologian, participant in the German Resistance movement against Nazism, and a founding member of the Confessing Church. He was involved in plots planned by members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office) to assassinate Adolf Hitler. He was arrested in March 1943, imprisoned, and eventually executed by hanging.==Family and youth== Bonhoeffer was born in Breslau (Wrocław), Silesia. He and his sister Sabine were twins and the sixth and seventh of eight children. His brother Walter was killed during World War I. His sister was married to Hans von Dohnanyi and was mother of the conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi and the later mayor of Hamburg, Klaus von Dohnanyi. His father, Karl Bonhoeffer, was a prominent German psychiatrist in Berlin; his mother, Paula, home-schooled the children. Though he was initially expected to follow his father into the field of psychology, Dietrich decided at an early age to become a theologian and later a Christian pastor. His parents supported his decision. He attended college in Tübingen and later at the University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in theology at the age of only 21. As Dietrich was under 25 at the time church regulations, he was unable to be ordained. This, however, gave Dietrich the opportunity to go abroad. He then spent a post-graduate year abroad studying at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. During this time, he would often visit the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where he became acquainted with the African-American Spiritual. He amassed a substantial collection of these spirituals, which he took with him when he went back to Germany.Return to GermanyDuring World War II, Bonhoeffer played a key leadership role in the Confessing Church, which opposed the anti-semitic policies of Adolf Hitler. He was among those who called for wider church resistance to Hitler's treatment of the Jews. While the Confessing Church was not large, it represented a major source of Christian opposition to the Nazi government in Germany. After the unsuccessful July 20 Plot in 1944, Bonhoeffer's connections with the conspirators were discovered. He was moved to a series of prisons and concentration camps ending at Flossenbürg.Photographs of the Flossenbürg concentration camp in April 1945 are available at http://canaris.fotopic.net/p47455018.html, http://canaris.fotopic.net/p47455084.html, and http://canaris.fotopic.net/p47455046.html.&lt;/ref&gt;Confessing ChurchAfter his visit to America, the Confessing Church would play a large role in Bonhoeffer's life, or rather Bonhoeffer would play a large role in the life of the Confessing Church, as he was one of its founders. Although Bonhoeffer started out as a Lutheran, he became frustrated with the "liberal theology" of the established Church after discussing it with his friend Karl Barth, an eminent theologian. Barth believed that "liberal theology" (understood as a movement emphasizing personal experience and societal development, not necessarily carrying a political orientation) minimized Scripture, reducing it in many ways to a mere textbook of metaphysics while sanctioning the deification of human culture. Barth and Bonhoeffer often discussed and debated rationalist and Hegelian-derived theology against Reformation doctrine, and over time Barth began to win Bonhoeffer over. Although Bonhoeffer would never totally throw aside liberal theology, he did feel it was too constraining, and held it in many ways responsible for the lack of relevance within the Church. Bonhoeffer and Barth became two of the main figures associated with the "neo-orthodox" movement within German- and English-speaking Protestantism in the mid-20th century.Imprisonment and ExecutionBonhoeffer returned to Germany in 1931, where he lectured on theology in Berlin and wrote several books. A strong opponent of Nazism, he was involved, together with Martin Niemöller, Karl Barth and others, in establishing the Confessing Church. In August 1933, he co-authored the Bethel Confession with Hermann Sasse and others. Between late 1933 and 1935, he served as pastor of two German-speaking Protestant churches in London: St. Paul's and Sydenham. While Bonhoeffer desired a trip to India to discover non-violent resistance with Gandhi, he returned to Germany to head a seminary for Confessing Church pastors which had been made illegal by the Nazi regime, first in Finkenwalde and then at the von Blumenthal estate of Gross Schlönwitz, which was closed at the outbreak of World War II. The Gestapo also banned him from preaching; then teaching; and finally any kind of public speaking. During this time, Bonhoeffer worked closely with numerous opponents of Adolf Hitler.In 1939, Bonhoeffer joined a secret group of high-ranking military officers based in the Abwehr, or Military intelligence Office, who wanted to overthrow the National Socialist regime by killing Hitler. Bonhoeffer was arrested in April 1943 after money used to help Jews escape to Switzerland was traced to him. He was charged with conspiracy and imprisoned in Berlin for a year and a half.In Flossenbürg, Bonhoeffer was executed by hanging at dawn on 1945 April 9, just three weeks before the liberation of Berlin and one month before the capitulation of Nazi Germany. The manner of execution was, like other executions associated with the July 20 Plot, so brutal and graphic that even Wehrmacht soldiers were loathe to watch. Bonhoeffer was stripped of clothing in his cell, tortured and ridiculed by the guards, and led naked into the execution yard. The lack of sufficient gallows to hang thousands of Germans after the July 20 Plot had caused Hitler and Nazi propagandist Josef Goebbels to seize on the idea of using meathooks from slaughterhousesAs a prisoner of war Kurt Vonnegut was held in a slaughterhouse in Dresden and survived the 1945 Dresden bombing. Those events formed the background for his famous novel Slaughterhouse Five. and slowly hoisting the victim to dangle from an incrementally tightening noose formed of piano wire.Goebbels had filmed similar earlier hangings. Hitler allegedly enjoyed watching the films, but troops in the field were known to walk out in disgust and nausea when the films were shown. There is no evidence that Bonhoeffer's execution was filmed, but the gruesome impression of it can be deduced from audience reaction to similar meathook executions, with the hopeless victims wriggling in slow asphyxiation in the piano-wire nooses. The asphyxiation is thought to have taken approximately half an hour.http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/julyplot.html, http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/13767/Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Memories-and-Perspectives/overview, http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2006/02/03/20060203-C1-00.html, http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/holocaust/a_question.htm .Also hanged with Bonhoeffer were conspirators Abwehr chief Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Canaris' deputy General Hans Oster, military jurist General Karl Sack, General Friedrich von Rabenau http://canaris.fotopic.net/p47817740.html, businessperson Theodor Strünck, and German resistance (anti-Nazi) fighter Ludwig Gehre.

In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and then, particularly, in the church. Along with enlightening us about his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and collective guilt, the volume unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what this implies for questions of authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.Act and Being Clifford Green (editor); Reinhard Krauss (translator); Nancy Lukens (translator). Fortress Press, 1996. ISBN 0-8006-8302-1Bonhoeffer’s second dissertation, written in 1929–30 and published in 1931 as Akt und Sein, deals with the questions of consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the Reformation insight about the origin of human sinfulness in the “heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor.” Here are Bonhoeffer’s thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology.Ecumenical, Academic and Pastoral Work: 1931–1932, translation of Ökumene, Universität, Pfarramt: 1931–1932.

ISBN 0-8006-8324-2Bonhoeffer's most widely read book begins, "Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace." That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official nazified state church, The book was first published in 1937 as Nachfolge (Discipleship). It soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount: what Jesus demanded of his followers—and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post- resurrection church.Theological Education at Finkenwalde: 1935–1937, translation of Illegale Theologenausbildung: 1935–1937.

ISBN 0-8006-8305-6.The stimulus for the writing of Life Together was the closing of the preacher’s seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer’s thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the “Brother’s House” there. Life Together was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as Gemeinsames Leben, and first translated into English in 1954. Harper SanFrancisco 1978 paperback: ISBN 0-06-060852-8Prayerbook of the Bible is a classic of Christian spirituality. In this theological interpretation of the Psalms, Bonhoeffer describes the moods of an individual’s relationship with God and also the turns of love and heartbreak, of joy and sorrow, that are themselves the Christian community’s path to God.Ethics (1955 in English by SCM Press). Touchstone edition, 1995 paperback: ISBN 0-684-81501-X. Fortress Press 2004 critical edition: Clifford Green (editor); Reinhard Krauss (translator); Douglas W. Stott (translator); Charles C. West (translator). ISBN 0-8006-8306-4.Written in prison and published in 1943 as Ethik, this is the culmination of Bonhoeffer's theological and personal odyssey. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.Fiction from Tegel Prison Clifford Green (editor); Nancy Lukens (translator). Fortress Press: 1999. ISBN 0-8006-8307-2.Writing fiction—an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story—occupied much of Bonhoeffer’s first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fiancée and dealing with his interrogation. “There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,” he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer’s family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer’s participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.Letters and Papers from Prison, (first English translation 1953 by SCM Press).
