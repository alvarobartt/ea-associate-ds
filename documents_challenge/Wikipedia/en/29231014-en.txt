The album reached number one on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 and the UK Albums Chart that year.BackgroundThe Massacre has a music video for every track except the intro.The Massacre was re-released on September 6 2005 with a remix of "Outta Control" featuring Mobb Deep. The re-release included a bonus DVD (with music videos for all of the songs, and the trailer for the movie Get Rich or Die Tryin') and excluded the G-Unit remix of "Hate It or Love It", clearly due to the ongoing feud between 50 Cent and The Game. The re-release helped it re-climb to number two in the United States.The Massacre was also released in a "censored" version that censors out most profanity, violence, and all drug content. "Gunz Come Out" has inconsistency in the editing, and contains some profanity. This album wasn't as heavily censored as Get Rich or Die Tryin', but it is still a very highly censored album ranking in severity with albums such as Tony Yayo's Thoughts of a Predicate Felon and Nas' Stillmatic.SalesThe album sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days of release, making it almost the fastest-selling album since SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991.Gundersen, Edna (March 9 2005).
