He later graduated with a degree in science at the University of Witwatersrand and studied crystallography at the University of Cape Town before moving to England, completing his doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1953.CareerWorking with Rosalind Franklin in John Bernal's lab at Birkbeck aroused a lifelong interest in the study of viruses, and during his time there in the late 1950s he made discoveries in the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus. Over the following decade Klug used methods from X-ray diffraction, microscopy and structural modelling to develop crystallographic electron microscopy in which a sequence of two-dimensional images of crystals taken from different angles are combined to produce three-dimensional images of the target.He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1981. Between 1986 and 1996 he was director of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, and was knighted in 1988. He was elected President of the Royal Society, and served from 1995-2000. He was appointed OM in 1995 - as is customary for Presidents of the Royal Society. He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute.In 2005 he was awarded South Africa's Order of Mapungubwe (gold) for exceptional achievements in medical science.ReferencesExternal linksAaron Klug biography at the Nobel FoundationAaron Klug interviews with Harry KrotoAaron Klug article by Bob Weintraub.The Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize   Category:1926 births Category:Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge Category:Biophysicists Category:British chemists Category:British Jews Category:British people of South African descent Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Jewish scientists Category:Lithuanian Jews Category:Living people Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the Order of Merit Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:Presidents of the Royal Society Category:South African Jews Category:South African scientists Category:University of Cape Town alumniar:آرون كلوغ ca:Aaron Klug de:Aaron Klug es:Aaron Klug eu:Aaron Klug fr:Aaron Klug id:Aaron Klug it:Aaron Klug he:אהרון קלוג lt:Aaron Klug nl:Aaron Klug ja:アーロン・クルーグ oc:Aaron Klug pl:Aaron Klug pt:Aaron Klug ro:Aaron Klug ru:Клуг, Аарон fi:Aaron Klug sv:Aaron Klug
