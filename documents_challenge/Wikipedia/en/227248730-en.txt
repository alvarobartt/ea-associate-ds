Culture Beat is a German Eurodance group formed in 1989 by Torsten Fenslau. The act has gone through a number of line-up changes over the years; they achieved the most success whilst fronted by singer Tania Evans and rapper Jay Supreme. Their 1993 single "Mr Vain" was a number 1 hit in at least nine European countries, and the act is thought to have sold more than 10 million records worldwide. Culture Beat - Official Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;BiographyTorsten Fenslau had been working as a deejay at the Frankfurt nightclub Dorian Gray, when he decided to form Culture Beat. His first single, the ambient house track "Der Erdbeermund", with a spoken vocal in German by Jo van Nelsen, peaked at number 11 in the German singles chart. Versions in English and French were also released (titled "Cherry Lips" and "Les lèvres cerises", respectively). An instrumental version was also a club hit in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 55.Shortly afterwards, Torsten recruited New Jersey-born rapper Jay Supreme and singer Lana Earl to front the act, and the second single "I Like You" reached number 30 in Germany, and number 6 in Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart. They released their first album, Horizon, in 1991.Lana was replaced by British singer Tania Evans in 1993, and the act took a harder Eurodance sound. "Mr Vain" became their biggest hit to date, reaching number 1 in Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom, where it sold more than half a million copies. It was also their first mainstream hit in the United States, peaking at number 17 on the Hot 100.Subsequent singles "Got to Get It" and "Anything" were also pan-European hits, and their second album Serenity was awarded the ECHO award for best-selling German album internationally, with more than two million copies sold.On November 6, 1993, Culture Beat's founder Torsten Fenslau was killed in a car accident in Messel. His brother Frank took over the group and they returned in 1995 with a third album called Inside Out, preceded by a single of the same name which reached number 5 in Germany and number 32 in the UK.In 1997, Frank decided to take the group in a different, more mature sounding musical direction and replaced Tania with Kim Sanders, who had previously scored a hit with "Impossible" by Captain Hollywood Project. Jay Supreme remained with the group for a short time after Tania's departure, but during recording of the next album he decided to leave the group. The album Metamorphosis was a minor chart success in 1998.Three years later, Jacky Sangster replaced Kim as the fourth female lead singer of Culture Beat. A single called "Insanity" was released in 2001 but was not a major hit. In 2003, to commemorate ten years since the release of the group's biggest hit, a new version of "Mr Vain" was issued in Germany and reached number 9 in the singles chart. In 2004, a greatest hits package was released ahead of a planned new album with Jacky as vocalist, but was cancelled before "Can't Go On Like This (No No)" was released. This single has very little success also.In May 2008, a brand new single called "Your Love" was finally released in Germany through Superstar Records. A special remix by D&K only available digitally. Jacky is set to perform at the "Back 2 The 90s" event in Riga, Latvia on November 21, 2008, alongside Ace of Base, Haddaway, Dr Alban and 2 Unlimited.:|: Biä»Eå U Serviss :|: Ticketservice Latvia :|:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Band membersLana Earl - Vocals (1989-1993)Torsten Fenslau - Keyboards & programming (1989-1993)Juergen Katzmann - Guitars, keyboards & programming (1989-1995)Jay Supreme - Vocals (1989-1998)Jens Zimmermann - Keyboards & programming (1989-1995)Peter Zweier - Keyboards & programming (1989-)Tania Evans - Vocals (1993-1997)Frank Fenslau - Keyboards & programming (1994-)Kim Sanders - Vocals (1998-1999)Jacky Sangster - Vocals (2001-)DiscographyAlbumsYearTitleChart positionsUnited KingdomGermanySweden1991Horizon]]''&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1993Serenity]]''13841995Inside Out]]''&mdash;22&mdash;1998Metamorphosis]]''&mdash;12&mdash;2003Best of Culture Beat&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;=== Singles ===YearTitleChart positionsUnited KingdomDance]]GermanyFranceSweden1989"Der Erdbeermund"55&mdash;11&mdash;&mdash;1990"I Like You"&mdash;630&mdash;&mdash;1991"Tell Me That You Wait"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"No Deeper Meaning"&mdash;9&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1993"Mr Vain"12132"Got to Get It"414105Anything]]"5744151994"World in Your Hands"20&mdash;1842&mdash;"Adelante"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1995Inside Out]]"3215546231996"Crying In The Rain"29&mdash;8&mdash;23Take Me Away]]"52&mdash;26&mdash;24"Walk The Same Line"&mdash;&mdash;64&mdash;401998"Pay No Mind"&mdash;&mdash;27&mdash;&mdash;"Rendez-Vous"&mdash;&mdash;538848"You Belong"&mdash;&mdash;77&mdash;&mdash;2001"Insanity"&mdash;&mdash;66&mdash;&mdash;2003"Mr Vain Recall"51&mdash;7&mdash;302004"Can't Go On Like This (No No)"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;2008"Your Love"]]&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;ReferencesSee alsoList of number-one dance hits (United States)List of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chartSnap!2 UnlimitedExternal linksCulture Beat's Official WebsiteCategory:German electronic music groups Category:German house music groups Category:German dance music groups Category:German musical groups Category:German trance music groups Category:Eurodance groups Category:1990s music groups Category:2000s music groups Category:Remixersbg:Кълчър Бийт de:Culture Beat es:Culture Beat fr:Culture Beat it:Culture Beat nl:Culture Beat pl:Culture Beat ro:Culture Beat fi:Culture Beat sv:Culture Beat
