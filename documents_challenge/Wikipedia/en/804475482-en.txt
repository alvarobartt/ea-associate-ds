He is married to Jessica Lemarie, with whom he has two children.He plays for Villarreal CF as a winger. He normally plays on the left wing but can play all across midfield or in a position to support the striker(s).BiographyFrench League careerPirès is a graduate of the FC Metz youth academy, making his senior debut in 1993, against Lyon. During his six seasons there, he scored 43 goals in 162 matches, and won the Coupe de la Ligue, prompting a £5 million move to Olympique de Marseille in 1998. At Marseille, Pirès had a mixed two-year stay. His first season saw him miss the French league title by a point, and his second season saw him suffer a spate of on- and off-field problems, which led him to boycott the club at the season's end.English football careerHe was signed by Arsenal for £6 million in 2000, after stiff competition from Real Madrid and Juventus, replacing Marc Overmars who had left for FC Barcelona for a record £25 million. Initially, Pirès' form was indifferent, and some people criticised him after his comments that the English game was too physical. However, he slowly began to regain the form he had shown at Metz, scoring a superb solo goal against Lazio in the 2000–01 Champions League, and the winner against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-finals; however Arsenal went on to lose the Cup final to Liverpool 2–1.By 2001–02, Pirès had fully got to grips with the English game and had one of his best seasons. Pirès scored some superb goals against Middlesbrough F.C. and Aston Villa. Against Aston Villa, Pirès chased after a long ball by Freddie Ljungberg, and lobbed the ball over the pursuing George Boateng, and finished off the move with a delightful chip over Peter Schmeichel. He led the Premiership assist charts and was voted both FWA Footballer of the Year and Arsenal's player of the season, as Arsenal won the league title. This was despite not playing the last two months of the season after suffering a cruciate ligament injury in a FA Cup match against Newcastle United.After a lengthy layoff, Pirès made his comeback in November 2002 as a substitute against Auxerre in the UEFA Champions League. Initially Pirès found it tough, but he finally found his form, scoring 14 Premiership goals in 20 starts that season, including a hat-trick against Southampton in the penultimate day of the season. Pirès was voted Barclaycard Player of the Month for February 2003. Pirès capped off his season by scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup final against Southampton.He went on to be a crucial part of Arsenal's quest for the Premiership title in the 2003–04 season, which they achieved, remaining unbeaten and becoming the first English top flight club to do so in 115 years. Pirès and his Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry were instrumental in that season, scoring a combined 57 goals in all competitions. Pirès made a sluggish start to the campaign, but a wondergoal against Liverpool F.C. at Anfield kick-started his season. Pirès showed football fans his sublime technique, skills and finishing, most notably with his goals against Liverpool, Bolton, Leeds. He surprised a lot of people with a world class tackle on Claude Makelele and following that, a run into the penalty box which dragged William Gallas and John Terry away, thus making space for Patrick Vieira to have a one on one with the Chelsea goalkeeper, and subsequently scoring. Arsenal won that match 2–1, with Vieira's goal the equaliser. That day of EPL action proved decisive, as Man Utd's failure to beat Leed's United during the same day resulted in Arsenal getting a huge lead in the title race. Arsenal never lost 1st place in the table for the rest of the season. More notably, Pirès will always be remembered for a game in the UEFA Champions League 1st leg match against Chelsea, Quarter-Finals, where he managed to beat John Terry to a header, which resulted in getting the equaliser for Arsenal, after Eidur Gudjohnson had given Chelsea the lead. Unfortunately for Arsenal and Pirès, they were eliminated after they lost 1–2 in the return leg, courtesy of a 87th minute Wayne Bridge goal. Pirès also showed his playmaking skills in the wonderfully crafted goal against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, in which Pirès was the architect in building up the goal, and capped off the move with a sublime finish to score Arsenal's 2nd goal of the game. Tottenham refused to give up, and managed to claw their way back and claimed a 2–2 draw. Despite that, Arsenal won the title after the match. Pirès finished that season with an impressive tally of 14 goals and 7 assists in the English Premier League. He was Arsenal's second top scorer (behind Thierry Henry) and had the joint amount of assists (along with Dennis Bergkamp) that season.In the 2004–05 season, Pirès finished third in the Premiership goalscorers table with 14 goals, behind team-mate Thierry Henry and Crystal Palace's Andrew Johnson. Pirès also picked up a second FA Cup winners' medal after Arsenal beat Manchester United on penalties. Pirès was replaced by Edu in the 2nd half of extra time in that match.During the 2005–06 season, Pirès wrangled with Arsenal over a new contract, in the hope of a new two-year deal. In keeping with the club's policy regarding players over 30, Pirès was only offered a 12-month extension to his contract, which expired in June 2006. Pirès started the season poorly, and was often preferred on both wings (left and right) to Freddie Ljungberg, Jose Antonio Reyes and Alexander Hleb. However, as the season progressed, Pirès's form improved (most notably since January 2006). Despite Pirès being 33, he still managed to get more goals in all competitions than Ljungberg, Reyes and Hleb, all of whom are much younger and stronger than Pires. Pirès played his last game for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions league final against Barcelona, where he was the player sacrificed after goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's sending off during the match. He seemed to be inconsolable when leaving the pitch in that last game for him at Arsenal. Pirès ended the season as Arsenal's joint 2nd top scorer (along with Robin Van Persie). Two of the most memorable moments of Pirès's last season at Arsenal were the tackle on Patrick Vieira of Juventus (which lead to Arsenal's first goal), and Pirès's superb long ball to Thierry Henry, who subsequently set up Cesc Fàbregas to score.In May 2006 he agreed to an offer from VillarrealPires agrees deal with Villarreal, BBC Sport, 2006-05-25 after a month of speculation, during which time he played against Villareal in the Champions League semi-final. One of the main reasons Pirès gave for leaving Arsenal was that he felt he was no longer a first choice under Arsene Wenger. Pirès was quoted saying "But I have to say I have had some disappointments this season. For instance I was on the bench very often." Furthermore Pirès says that Wenger's decision to withdraw him in the UEFA Champions League Final showed he had slipped in the eyes of his French boss. Pirès said that he felt hurt on how Arséne Wenger did not trust him anymore, which was a major factor that convinced him that it was time to move on from Arsenal.Arsenal fans and players alike were saddened by Pirès's departure. His ex-Arsenal teammate Cesc Fàbregas told the August 2006 edition of Sky - The Magazine: "It was sad to lose Robert Pirès to Villarreal."On the official Arsenal matchday program for the game against Wigan Athletic on 11 February 2007, Pires revealed his heartbreak of being substituted so early on during the game against Barcelona. Pires stated: "I was very disappointed. When I saw my number on the fourth official’s board to be substituted, I couldn’t believe it. It was my last game after six years at the Club, a Champions League Final in front of all my family in Paris where I became World Cup champion and it lasted just 12 minutes. That was very hard to take."On 11 July 2008, Arsenal fans voted Pirès as the club's sixth greatest player of all time.Spanish football careerIn May 2006 Robert Pirès agreed to join Spanish side Villarreal. He joined on a free transfer, subject to passing a medical, bringing to an end his six-year career as an Arsenal player. Pires was officially unveiled as a Villarreal player on 3 July 2006. He scored his first goal for the club in 3–3 pre-season draw with Newcastle United (5 August 2006). However, on 18 August 2006, Robert damaged the cruciate ligament in his left knee in a friendly match against Cádiz and required corrective surgery to alleviate the problem which kept him out of action for seven months in his new club in Spanish top flight.Pirès finally recovered from knee injury and made his first league appearance for Villarreal as a second-half substitute when he was named in Villareal's squal to face Real Sociedad on 17 March 2007. Pirès scored his first league goal on his return from injury in a 3–3 draw away to Real Betis on 31 March 2007. After three appearances as a substitute, Pirès made his first start for Villareal on 22 April 2007 against Barcelona. He opened the scoring for his team to defeat league leaders Barcelona 2–0, avenging his premature departure against Barcelona in the Champions League Final the previous May. On 13 May 2007, in a thumping 4–1 win at Osasuna, the former France midfielder gave the visitors the perfect start with a seventh-minute opener as Villarreal continued their late-season push for a European spot. The run took the "The Yellow Submarine ," sinking at 11th spot without him in the side, to the brink of a UEFA Cup place in barely six weeks. Villarreal ended the season in 5th spot wherein Pirès played crucial roles in helping Villareal with the late charge up winning each of their final eight games and an entry into the UEFA Cup.With the ongoing saga between Juan Román Riquelme and the board of Villareal, Pirès' leadership qualities the following season helped Villareal to win six of their opening eight games. Against Barcelona at El Madrigal, Pirès technique earned the Yellow Submarine two penalties which were duly converted by captain Marcos Senna.Pirès has mentioned that after his two year deal at Villareal ends he would love one final season with Arsenal,http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=397758&amp;cc=9999 although he has also has been extremely happy with life at Villarreal.International careerPirès was part of France's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winning squads (Pirès laid on the pass for David Trézéguet's winning goal in the final), but had to miss the 2002 World Cup due to the injury he sustained playing for Arsenal. He also played in 1996 Olympic Games and Euro 2004. However, a dispute in late 2004 with French national coach Raymond Domenech put a halt to Pirès' international career. He won 79 caps for his country and scored 14 goals.Career statisticsHonoursMetzWinnerFrench League Cup: 1996/1997Runner-upFrench League 1: 1997/1998Olympique de MarseilleRunner-upFrench League 1: 1998/99UEFA Cup: 1999ArsenalWinnerFA Premier League: 2001/02, 2003/04FA Cup: 2003, 2005FA Community Shield: 2002, 2004Runner-upUEFA Champions League: 2005/06FA Premier League: 2000/01, 2002/03, 2004/05FA Cup: 2001FA Community Shield: 2005VillarrealRunner-upLa Liga: 2007/08InternationalWinnerWorld Cup: 1998European Championship: 2000FIFA Confederations Cup: 2001, 2003Individual honoursLégion d'Honneur, France's highest decoration 1998Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year: 2001/2002 (with Arsenal)PFA Team of the Year: 2002, 2003, 2004,FA Premier League Highest number of assist: 2001/2002 (with Arsenal)FIFA Confederation Cup Golden Ball award, best player of the tournament - 2001FA Premier League Top goalscoring midfielder (14): 2004/2005 (with Arsenal)Club career(correct as of 30 September 2007)ClubSeasonLeagueCupEuropeTotalAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsMetz1992–932------2-1993–94241-----2411994–95359?----3591995–963811?----38111996–973211?--6-38111997–983111?-03-3411All16243?--9-17143Marseille1998–99346?--1134591999–00322?--112434All668?--2258813Arsenal2000–01]]3347631215182001–02]]289155112345132002–03]]26143729-42162003–04]]3614104110450192004–05]]33144628147172005–06]]3374321224811All18962433111631128384Villarreal2006–07]]1131----1132007–08]]373?----373All4861----486International careerNational teamSeasonAppsGoalsFrance1994–951251995–963-1996–97111997–981251998–991251999–001252000–011252001–021252002–031252003–041252004–059-2005–0600All7941References  Accolades  External linksProfile &amp; statistics at FootballDatabase.comProfile at arsenal.comProfile &amp; News at footymania.comStatistics at soccerbase.comAutobiography Details of Pirès' biographyProfile at 4thegame.comProfiles at sporting-heroes.net     Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:FC Metz players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:FIFA 100 Category:France international footballers Category:France under-21 international footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:French expatriate footballers in Spain Category:French footballers Category:French people of Spanish descent Category:French people of Portuguese descent Category:Footballers at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Football (soccer) wingers Category:Stade de Reims players Category:Olympic footballers of France Category:Olympique de Marseille players Category:Premier League players Category:Villarreal CF footballers Category:La Liga footballers Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2000 players Category:2001 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2003 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:UEFA European Football Championship-winning playersar:روبير بيريز bn:রবার্ট পিরেস be:Рабэр Пірэс bg:Робер Пирес ca:Robert Pirès da:Robert Pirès de:Robert Pirès es:Robert Pirès fa:روبر پیرس fr:Robert Pirès hr:Robert Pirès it:Robert Pirès he:רובר פירס hu:Robert Pirès nl:Robert Pirès ja:ロベール・ピレス no:Robert Pirès pl:Robert Pirès pt:Robert Pirès ru:Пирес, Робер fi:Robert Pirès sv:Robert Pirès th:โรแบร์ ปิแรส vi:Robert Pirès tr:Robert Pires zh:罗贝尔·皮雷
