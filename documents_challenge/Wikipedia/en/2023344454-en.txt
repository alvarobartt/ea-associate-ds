The new album will feature over 100 musicians, including a Chinese choir and an orchestra. However, he would not be drawn on the name of the project or whether it ties into any of his previous work. Albarn told BBC 6Music: "The new album got about 80, 90 musicians on it – something in that region. It's got a 100-piece Chinese choir on one of the tunes. That plus the orchestra probably goes to about 120, 130 people." Albarn hinted that this project may have something to do with his recent opera, 'Monkey: Journey To The West.' He says that the title of the project had "something of monkeys in there. There's a monkey or two in there at least – a bit like Gorillaz as well. It's not an opera though, it's a proper record".Damon Albarn to release '130 musician' album | News | NME.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The Good, the Bad and the QueenIn May 2006, NME reported that Albarn was working with Danger Mouse on his first solo album, tentatively titled The Good, the Bad and the Queen. However, in July 2006, NME reported that those plans had been switched to the formation of a new band titled The Good, the Bad and the Queen. This proved to be inaccurate, as Albarn and other members of the group have indicated that The Good, the Bad and the Queen is the name of the album and not the band itself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Courier Mail"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time out"&lt;/ref&gt;The album was awarded Best Album at the 2007 Mojo Awards on 18 June.&lt;/ref&gt;The group's line-up is composed of Albarn, former Clash bassist Paul Simonon, The Verve/Gorillaz guitarist Simon Tong, and drummer Tony Allen of Fela Kuti's band, Africa 70; Danger Mouse produced the album and decided on the final track listing.The first single by the line-up, "Herculean", was released in late October 2006, and peaked at #22 in the UK Singles Chart.

That single fared slightly better than "Herculean", peaking at #20, while the album peaked at #2 in the UK Albums Chart and went gold during its first week of release in the UK. "Green Fields" was released as the third single from the album in April 2007, just missing out on the Top 50.In April 27, 2008, The Good The Bad And The Queen headlined the Love Music Hate Racism Carnival in Victoria Park where they introduced on stage several guests including ex-Specials drummer Jerry Dammers.Monkey: Journey To The WestIn their first major work together since Gorillaz, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, along with acclaimed Chinese theatre and opera director Chen Shi-zheng, adapted for stage the ancient Chinese legend Journey to the West. as Monkey: Journey to the West, which received its world premiere as the opening show of the 2007 Manchester International Festival, on June 28, 2007 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester.Totally catchy monkey, Guardian Unlimited 2 July 2007  Albarn wrote the score, Hewlett designed the set and costumes.The opera was Albarn and Hewlett's second collaboration with the Manchester International Festival.

His involvement with her profoundly influenced his songwriting in Blur in the mid-to-late 1990s. "Yuko and Hiro" from The Great Escape (1995) is about Damon's love and infatuation with Justine and their inability to see each other. "Beetlebum", their single from the eponymous Blur (1997) was about Justine's rumoured heroin addiction, while some songs as "Tender" and "No Distance Left to Run" from 13 (1999) are about their break-up. He now lives in Bayswater, London with artist Suzi Winstanley, and their daughter Missy, born in 1999. Albarn and Frischmann remain good friends.Albarn was very close to his grandfather, Edward Albarn, who had been a conscientious objector in the Second World War and was involved in a farming community in Lincolnshire. Albarn himself is outspokenly anti-war and has criticised British involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2002 he and Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack took out full page advertisements in the NME challenging the need for war. Albarn contributed backing vocals to a song on Massive Attack's 100th Window, released the following year.In 2005 Albarn, among others, criticised the London Live 8 concert for not featuring enough black artists; among the few included were Ms. Dynamite, Snoop Dogg, and Youssou N'Dour. Eventually the organisers added a separate Somerset concert to the programme in order to showcase African musicians. Albarn said he did not want to perform at Live 8 because he thought it was too "exclusive" and may have been motivated by self-gain.http://www.nme.com/news/blur/20152In the nineties he spent a good deal of time in Reykjavík and for a time he became something of a permanent fixture in the "Kaffibarinn", a café/bar/inn of which he was part owner. He currently owns a house in Grafarvogur, a suburb of Reykjavík. He composed the soundtrack to the 2000 Icelandic film 101 Reykjavík.Albarn is a vocal critic of celebrity culture, saying "We need to dismantle very significant parts of our culture and really re-examine them. I suppose you start with the celebrity thing.... you have to get rid of things like The X Factor immediately."Albarn is a fan of classic rock band The Kinks which inspired his former band Blur. Albarn performed Waterloo Sunset with Ray Davies in the mid 90s.The glass bead necklace he frequently wears was a gift given to him by his mother when he was six.Discography ===Albums and Chart Positions===YearAlbumUKUSUS HeatAUSGERCertification]]1991Leisure]]''7-20--Gold (UK)1993Modern Life is Rubbish15-6--Gold (UK)1994Parklife1-645-4x Platinum (UK)1994The Special Collectors Edition-----1995The Great Escape]]''1150-10-3x Platinum (UK)1996Live at the Budokan-----1997Blur]]''161-22-Platinum (UK)Gold (US)1998Bustin' + Dronin'50----199913]]''180-12-Platinum (UK)1999The 10 Year Limited Edition Anniversary Box Set-----1999Ravenous OST-----2000Blur: The Best Of3186---2x Platinum (UK)2000Ordinary Decent Criminal OST-----2001Gorillaz]]''314-1732x Platinum (UK)Platinum (US)Gold (AUS)Gold (GER)2002G-Sides6584---2002Laika Come Home-156---2002101 Reykjavik OST-----2002Mali Music-----2003Think Tank]]''156-30-Gold (UK)2003Democrazy-----2005Demon Days16-225x Platinum (UK)3x Platinum (NZ)3x Platinum (IRE)2x Platinum (US)2x Platinum (AUS)Platinum (CAN)Platinum (HK)2007D-Sides63166---2007The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen249---Gold (UK)2008Journey to the West]]''5----ReferencesSources and external linksDamon Albarn pieces including video interviews on BBC Imagine...Damon Albarn interviewAlbarn's Mali mission - BBC NewsBlur biographyIMDB entry on Damon Albarn   Category:Blur members Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Leytonstone Category:People from London Category:Alumni of Goldsmiths, University of London Category:British anti-war activists Category:English activists Category:English vegetarians Category:English songwriters Category:English male singers Category:English keyboardists Category:English rock singers Category:Melodica players Category:Falsettos Category:Ivor Novello Award winnersca:Damon Albarn cs:Damon Albarn cy:Damon Albarn da:Damon Albarn de:Damon Albarn es:Damon Albarn fr:Damon Albarn gl:Damon Albarn ko:데이먼 알반 it:Damon Albarn nl:Damon Albarn ja:デーモン・アルバーン no:Damon Albarn pl:Damon Albarn pt:Damon Albarn ru:Албарн, Деймон se:Damon Albarn fi:Damon Albarn sv:Damon Albarn tr:Damon Albarn
