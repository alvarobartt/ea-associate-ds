Following the 2005 cycling season he moved as aforementioned to the T-Mobile Team where he had a good string of results in the early season. In the 2006 Paris-Nice race he was unimpressive, finishing in 41st position, however he steadily improved, finishing in 4th overall in the Vuelta al País Vasco , in addition to two Top-5 stage finishes.
