Some features include a built-in FTP client, file compare, archive file navigation, and a multi-rename tool.At one point, Total Commander was called Windows Commander; the name was changed in 2002 after the developers received a letter from Microsoft explaining that "Windows" was a registered trademark.Total Commander - Name change&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;This application is written by Christian Ghisler in Delphi 2 (32-bit version) and Delphi 1 (16-bit version). The program is extensible by programmers via an open plugin-API and it has the ability to bind external programs for viewing or editing files. Many plugins are freely available for e.g. different packer formats or file viewer for special file formats.A freeware version of Total Commander also exists for Windows Mobile.The main version is shareware – the user should register or delete it within 30 days. The unregistered version nags for registration every time it starts, but it retains full functionality, even after the 30-day trial period.One notable feature of Total Commander is that in addition to allowing access to Windows partitions, there is a plugin that allows users to access both EXT2/EXT3 and Reiser partitions on the same machine. Hence, for dual-boot machines with Windows and Linux, Total Commander allows access to files stored on the Linux partition while running Windows.The download is about 2MB; available in both 16- and 32-bit versions, for the various versions of Windows, and is compatible with Linux using Wine.ReferencesSee alsoComparison of file managersComparison of FTP client softwareExternal linksThe official site of Total CommanderTotal Commander overview from Softpanorama e-book on orthodox managersCategory:Orthodox file managers Category:Pocket PC software Category:Windows software Category:FTP clients Category:Shareware Category:File comparison toolscs:Total Commander da:Total Commander de:Total Commander es:Total Commander fr:Total Commander ko:토탈 커맨더 hu:Total Commander nl:Total Commander pl:Total Commander ru:Total Commander sr:Total komander sv:Total Commander tr:Total Commander uk:Total Commander zh:Total Commander
