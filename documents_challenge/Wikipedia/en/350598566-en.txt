The Fiat Punto is a supermini produced by the Italian manufacturer, Fiat, since 1993. It is currently in its third generation.Mark 1 (1993-1999) | length =  | width =  | height =  | weight = 830&ndash;1040&nbsp;kg (1829&ndash;2292 lb)1070&nbsp;kg (2358 lb) cabrio | aka = | fuel_capacity = 47&nbsp;L (10.3&nbsp;Imp.&amp;nbsp;gallons)(12.4&nbsp;U.S. gal) | related = | similar = | designer = Giorgetto Giugiaro  Internally codenamed Project 176, the Punto was announced in September 1993 and launched in early 1994 as a replacement for the aging Fiat Uno. The Fiat Punto was voted European Car of the Year for 1995. The Punto's distinctive clean-cut styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro was an instant hit (though one of the car's most recognisable features, the vertical tail/rear lights, were not part of Giugiaro's original design and were in fact added later in-house at Fiat's factory). Competitive pricing which undercut rivals such as the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Polo also helped the Punto become an instant success in the European marketplace.Entry levelEntry-level in the Punto range were the 1.1 and 1.2&nbsp;L petrol engines and the 1.7 diesel engine. The 1.2 engine's actual capacity is 1.242 liters, available in 3 versions. The first, was fitted in the Punto ELX 75 and produced 75 hp at 6000 rpm while the second, fitted to Punto ELX 85 produced 86 hp at 6000 rpm. The third was a 60hp engine which eventually replaced the 1.1 54hp engine.Sporting versionsA 1.6 Sporting was also available producing 88 bhp (replaced in 1997 by the more economic 16 valve 1.2 unit), but the best performing version was the  1.4 GT using an evolution of the turbocharged 128 SOHC engine originally found in the Fiat Uno Turbo Mk II- capable of running over  and reaching  in just 7.9 seconds. This car was also fitted with a 5-speed manual gearbox, with different gear ratios than the ELX series. During the years the GT was made in three different "series" with power  (1993-1995), (1995-1997) and  (1997-1999).ConvertibleA cabriolet (convertible) version was also available; built by Bertone (rather than at the main Fiat factory) it featured a powered fully-retracting roof and was one of the cheapest open-top cars in the world at the time.Other versionsParticular versions of the Mark I Punto were the Punto 6Speed, a 1.1 FIRE Punto 55 with a 6-speed gearbox, the Punto Selecta with an automatic gearbox, and the Punto ED (Economical Drive), a 1.1 Punto whose 5-speed geabox was designed for high fuel efficiency.Mark 2 (1999-2003) | length =  | width =  | height =  | weight = 860&ndash;1050&nbsp;kg (1895&ndash;2314 lb) | aka = | fuel_capacity = 47&nbsp;L (10.3&nbsp;Imp.&amp;nbsp;gallons)(12.4&nbsp;U.S. gal) | related = | similar = | designer =  The second generation Nuova (New) Punto, codenamed Project 188, was launched in 1999. The styling was all-new while retaining the original Punto's distinctive shape and design, while the chassis and interior were completely overhauled. The new Punto also became the first Fiat in decades to carry the original round Fiat badge, to celebrate Fiat's centenary.Entry levelThe 1.1 and 1.4 turbo engines were discontinued due to emissions issues, and the entry-level models had only a 1.2 petrol unit (with either 8 or 16 valves, giving 60 and 80 hp respectively) or a 1.9 diesel (with or without common-rail injection).Sporting versionsTwo sporty versions vere offered. The 1.2 16 valve Sporting model with a 6-speed manual, and the hot 1.8 HGT which could reach almost 130 mph. The 1.2 16V model also has a CVT-equipped variant (with a sequential manual shift mode consisting of 6 gears, 7 for the Sporting model). The 1.8 HGT accelerates 0-60 in 8.2 seconds. While slower than its turbocharged 1.4 predecessor in a straight line, it was considered a big improvement in handling over the Mark 1 GT.Power steeringThe Mark two Fiat Punto has also adopted Dualdrive electric power steering and comes with two operation modes, using an electric motor, rather than a hydraulic pump driven by the engine. This results in reduced fuel consumption and less environmental impact. It has a fuel economy of  - urban and  - extra urban for the 1.7 diesel. The 1.8 petrol does  - urban and  - extra urban.Punto Mk2 specificationsCapacity1242&ndash;1910&nbsp;ccPower60-Max. speed155-Acceleration0–100&nbsp;km/h: 15.0&ndash;8.2 secondsMark 2 (Facelift) 2003-present | length =  | width =  | height =  | weight = 860&ndash;1050&nbsp;kg (1895&ndash;2314 lb) | aka = | fuel_economy = | fuel_capacity = 47&nbsp;L (10.3&nbsp;Imp.&amp;nbsp;gallons)(12.4&nbsp;U.S. gal) | related = Zastava 10 | similar = | designer =  In early 2003, Fiat celebrated the rollout of the 5,000,000th production Punto.
