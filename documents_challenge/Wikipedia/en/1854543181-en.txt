True owls or typical owls (family Strigidae) are one of the two generally accepted families of owls, the other being the barn owls (Tytonidae). The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order; here, the typical owls are a subfamily Striginae. This is unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae for details), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved. This large family comprises around 189 living species in 25 genera. The typical owls have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found on every continent except Antarctica.MorphologyWhile typical owls (hereafter referred to simply as owls) vary greatly in size, with the smallest species, the Elf Owl, being a hundred times smaller than the largest, the Eurasian Eagle Owl, owls generally share an extremely similar body plan.J. S. Marks, R. J. Cannings & H. Mikkola (1999) "Family Strigidae (Typical Owls)". In del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. (editors). (1999). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 5: Barn-Owls to Hummingbirds. Lynx Edicions. ISBN 8487334253  They tend to have large heads short tails, cryptic plumage and round facial discs around the eyes. The family is generally arboreal (with a few exceptions like the Burrowing Owl) and obtain their food on the wing. The wings are large, broad, rounded and long. Like other birds of prey many owl species exhibit reverse sexual dimorphism in size, where females are larger than males (as opposed to the more typical situation in birds where males are larger).Caroline M. Earhart and Ned K. Johnson (1970) "Size Dimorphism and Food Habits of North American Owls" Condor 72 (3): 251-264Because of their nocturnal habits they tend not to exhibit sexual dimorphism in their plumage. The feathers are soft and the base of each is downy, allowing for silent flight. The toes and tarsus are feathered in some species, and more so in species at higher latitudes.Kelso L & Kelso E (1936) "The Relation of Feathering of Feet of American Owls to Humidity of Environment and to Life Zones" Auk 53 (1): 51-56 Numerous species of owl in the genus Glaucidium and the Northern Hawk Owl have eye patches on the backs of their heads, apparently to convince other birds they are being watched at all times. Numerous nocturnal species have ear-tufts, feathers on the sides of the head that are thought to have a camouflage function, breaking up the outline of a roosting bird. The feathers of the facial disc are arranged in order to increase sound delivered to the ears. Hearing in owls is highly sensitive and the ears are asymmetrical allowing the owl to localise a sound. In addition to hearing owls have massive eyes relative to their body size. Contrary to popular belief, however, owls cannot see well in extreme dark and are able to see fine in the day.BehaviourOwls are generally nocturnal and spend much of the day roosting. They are often perceived as tame since they will allow people to approach quite closely before taking flight, but they are instead attempting to avoid detection. The cryptic plumage and inconspicuous locations adopted are an effort to avoid predators and mobbing by small birds.SystematicsThe nearly 200 extant species are assigned to a number of genera, which are in taxonomic order:Genus Megascops: screech-owls, some 20 speciesGenus Otus: scops-owls; probably paraphyletic, about 45 speciesGenus Pyrroglaux - Palau OwlGenus Gymnoglaux - Bare-legged Owl or Cuban Screech-owlGenus Ptilopsis - white-faced owls, 2 speciesGenus Mimizuku - Giant Scops-owl or Mindanao Eagle-owlGenus Bubo - horned owls, eagle-owls and fish-owls; paraphyletic with Nyctea, Ketupa and Scotopelia, some 25 speciesGenus Strix - earless owls, some 15 speciesGenus Ciccaba - 4 speciesGenus Lophostrix - Crested OwlGenus Jubula - Maned OwlGenus Pulsatrix - spectacled owls, 3 speciesGenus Surnia - Northern Hawk-owl]]Genus Glaucidium - pygmy owls, about 30-35 speciesGenus Xenoglaux - Long-whiskered OwletGenus Micrathene - Elf OwlGenus Athene - 2-4 species (depending on whether Speotyto and Heteroglaux are included or not)Genus Aegolius - saw-whet owls, 4 speciesGenus Ninox - Australasian hawk-owls, some 20 speciesGenus Uroglaux - Papuan Hawk-owlGenus Pseudoscops - Jamaican Owl and possibly Striped OwlGenus Asio - eared owls, 6-7 speciesGenus Nesasio - Fearful OwlRecently [[extinct]]Genus Mascarenotus - Mascarene owls, 3 species (extinct c.1850)Genus Sceloglaux - Laughing Owl (extinct 1914?)[[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds|Late Quaternary prehistoric extinctions]]Genus Grallistrix - Stilt-owls, 4 speciesKaua‘i Stilt-owl, Grallistrix aucepsMaui Stilt-owl, Grallistrix erdmaniMoloka‘i Stilt-owl, Grallistrix gelechesO‘ahu Stilt-owl, Grallistrix orionGenus Ornimegalonyx - Caribbean giant owls, 1-2 speciesCuban Giant Owl, Ornimegalonxy oteroiOrnimegalonyx sp. - probably subspecies of O. oteroi[[Fossil]] recordMioglaux (Late Oligocene? - Early Miocene of WC Europe) - includes "Bubo" poirreiriIntutula (Early/Middle Miocene of WC Europe) - includes "Strix/Ninox" brevisAlasio (Middle Miocene of Vieux-Collonges, France) - includes "Strix" collongensisPlacement unresolved:"Otus/Strix" wintershofensis - fossil (Early/Middle Miocene of Wintershof West, Germany) - may be close to extant genus Ninox (Olson 1985:131)"Strix" edwardsi - fossil (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France)"Asio" pygmaeus - fossil (Early Pliocene of Odessa, Ukraine)Strigidae gen. et sp. indet.
