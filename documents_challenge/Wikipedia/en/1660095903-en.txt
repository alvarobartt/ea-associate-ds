  Bustards are large terrestrial birds mainly associated with dry open country and steppes in the Old World. They make up the family Otididae (formerly known as Otidae). They were renowned by the ancient Arabs for being unnaturally stupid.Hayawān, Encyclopedia of IslamBustards are omnivorous and nest on the ground. They walk steadily on strong legs and big toes, pecking for food as they go. They have long broad wings with "fingered" wingtips, and striking patterns in flight. Many have interesting mating displays, such as inflating throat sacs or elevating elaborate feathered crests. The female lays three to five dark, speckled, eggs in a scrape in the ground, and incubates them alone.Bustards are gregarious outside the breeding season, but are very wary and difficult to approach in the open habitats they prefer.Bota, G., J. Camprodon, S. Mañosa & M.B. Morales (Editores). (2005). Ecology and Conservation of steppe-land birds. Lynx Editions. Barcelona ISBN 84-87334-99-7; 978-84-87334-99-3.StatusMost species are declining or endangered through habitat loss and hunting, even where they are nominally protected. Two great bustard eggs were recently laid in Britain for the first time in over 150 yearshttp://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/bustard-eggs.htmlhttp://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/bustard-eggs.html&lt;/ref&gt;, but were unfertilized&mdash;probably owing to the still juvenile male population. The last bustard died out in Britain in about 1832, but the bird is being reintroduced through batches of chicks imported from Russia.FloricansSome Indian bustards are also called Floricans. The origin of the name is unclear. Jerdon writes in his bird of India (1862) The Hobson-Jobson dictionary however casts doubt on this theory stating that Species in taxonomic orderFAMILY: OTITIDAEGenus: ''Otis''Great Bustard, Otis tardaGenus: ''Ardeotis''Arabian Bustard, Ardeotis Kori Bustard, Ardeotis kori, subspecies kori and struthinuclusGreat Indian Bustard, Ardeotis nigricepsAustralian Bustard, Ardeotis australisGenus: ''Chlamydotis''Houbara Bustard, Chlamydotis undulata, subspecies undulata and fuertaventuraeMacqueen's Bustard, Chlamydotis macqueeniiMacqueen's Bustard has recently been split from the Houbara Bustard as a full species.Genus: ''Neotis''Ludwig's Bustard, Neotis ludwigiiStanley Bustard, or Denham's Bustard, Neotis denhamiHeuglin's Bustard, Neotis heugliniiNubian Bustard, Neotis nubaGenus: ''Eupodotis''White-bellied Bustard, Eupodotis senegalensisBlue Bustard, Eupodotis caerulescensKaroo Bustard, Eupodotis vigorsiiRüppell's Bustard, Eupodotis rueppelliiLittle Brown Bustard, Eupodotis humilisGenus: ''Lophotis''Savile's Bustard, Lophotis savileiBuff-crested Bustard, Lophotis gindianaRed-crested Bustard, Lophotis ruficristaGenus: ''Afrotis''Black Bustard, Afrotis afraWhite-quilled Bustard, Afrotis afraoidesGenus: ''Lissotis''Black-bellied Bustard, Lissotis melanogasterHartlaub's Bustard, Lissotis hartlaubiiGenus: ''Houbaropsis''Bengal Florican, Houbaropsis bengalensisGenus: ''Sypheotides''Lesser Florican, Sypheotides indicaGenus: ''Tetrax''Little Bustard, Tetrax tetraxNotesReferencesEcology and conservation of Steppe-Land birds by Gerard Bota et al.
