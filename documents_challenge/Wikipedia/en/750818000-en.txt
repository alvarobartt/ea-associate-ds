News - 911 Calls Released in O'Neal Case - Farrah Fawcett&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;O'Neal in an interview with the Los Angeles Times charged that his son grazed him "four or five times" with the fireplace poker and that when he ducked to avoid the swinging weapon, Griffin "hit his own girlfriend in the head." O'Neal adds that he got "nervous" because of the woman's pregnancy. "I fled to my room," he says, "and I got my gun." When Griffin pursued him anew, says Ryan, he fired his gun "into the banister" to scare Griffin into fleeing. This is not the first time O'Neal has been accused of assaulting his son Griffin; rumors have circulated concerning O'Neal's temper with his children for some time, gaining some traction with allegations made by his daughter Tatum. In the early 1980s a fight between Ryan and Griffin O'Neal over the latter's drug use left the younger man with two teeth missing.Tatum's Valley Of Tears, Former Child Star Talks About Her New Book, 'A Paper Life' - CBS News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Complicating matters, a separate report claimed that the cause of the altercation was that Griffin had chained his half-brother Redmond to a staircase in the belief the younger man intended to buy illegal drugs, and that Ryan, discovering the chain on his return from a dinner in honor of Farrah Fawcett, flew into a rage in which he (rather than Griffin) began waving the poker. According to this scenario &ndash; sourced to "unidentified law-enforcement officials" &ndash; Ryan may have been responsible for the injuries to Miss Berry.
