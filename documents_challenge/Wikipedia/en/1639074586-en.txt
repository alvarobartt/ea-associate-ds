 BBCode is an abbreviation for Bulletin Board Code, the lightweight markup language used to format posts in many message boards. It is also called forum codes. The available tags are usually indicated by rectangular brackets surrounding a keyword, and they are parsed by the message board system before being translated into a markup language that web browsers understand, usually HTML or XHTML.PurposeBBCode was devised to provide a safer, easier and more limited way of allowing users to format their messages. Programmer convenience was certainly another factor, as BBCode is very simple to implement. Previously, many message boards allowed the users to include HTML formatting, a side effect of which was that malformed HTML could disrupt the page's layout, or HTML could be used to run JavaScript leading to XSS attacks. Some implementations of BBCode have suffered problems related to the way they translate the BBCode into HTML, which could negate the security that was intended to be given by BBCode. An alternative is a properly written HTML filter (many of which are freely available).Although the basic tags of BBCode are similar in most internet forum software, there is currently no standards document for BBCode and there are consequently many incompatible variants. Some variants are case-sensitive while others are not. Some variants have tags which highlight the formatting of HTML, ASP, PHP, SQL and other markup languages and programming languages.BBCode tagsThe following are the most common BBCode tags available to most modern message boards, and are displayed here with their HTML equivalents. However, it should be noted that the effect of these tags can be changed substantially, and the effect may not be identical on all sites using BBCode.

In addition, some bulletin board systems allow administrators to define their own custom BBCodes. This is usually done by asking them to specify the BBCode markup (utilizing variables/wildcards to indicate the user-customizable parts of the code) and then indicating the XHTML replacement which will be substituted for the BBCode.External linksBBCode guide at phpBB.comBBCode quick referenceBBCode extension for Mozilla FirefoxBBCodeXtra extension for Mozilla FirefoxHTML::BBCode perl moduleHTML::BBReverse perl modulePython BBCode implementationDotnet BBCode implementationPHP ImplementationsPECL (PHP extension) BBCode implementation - with configurable C libraryPEAR BBCode implementationRecruiting Parser - over 25 tags, bundled smilies and extrasBBcode2HTML - Free & easy BBcode translation in PHPBBCode Parser Class Free BBCode Parser Class written in PHPAuthoring ToolsWYSIWYG BBCode Editor - A Free BBCode Editor written in Javascript for PHP.BBCode Table Generator ToolPawsoft FassCategory:Internet forum software Category:Markup languages Category:Lightweight markup languagecs:BBCode de:BBCode es:BBCode fr:BBCode it:BBCode hu:BBCode nl:BBCode ja:BBコード pl:BBCode pt:BBCode ru:BBCode fi:BBCode sv:BBCode vi:BBCode tr:BBCode zh:BBCode
