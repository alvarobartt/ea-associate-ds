 The Ernst Happel Stadium () in Leopoldstadt, the 2nd district of Austria's capital Vienna, was known as the Prater Stadium (Praterstadion) prior to 1992. It was built between 1929 and 1931 for the second Workers' Olympiad to the design of German architect Otto Ernst Schweizer. The stadium was renamed in honour of Ernst Happel following his death in 1992. The stadium was host to seven games in UEFA Euro 2008, including the final which saw Spain triumph over Germany. It also served as a Holocaust prison during WWII.FootballThe Ernst Happel Stadium is the largest football stadium in Austria. It is the home of the Austrian national football team. Club football matches are generally limited to the domestic cup and international competitions featuring one of Vienna's top clubs, FK Austria Wien and SK Rapid Wien, as their regular stadiums are too small to host UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup matches. Local derbies between FK Austria and SK Rapid have also been played in the stadium.The stadium is rated one of UEFA's Five Star Stadiums permitting it to host the UEFA Champions League final. The seating capacity was temporarily expanded to 53,008&lt;/ref&gt; for the 2008 European Football Championship, with the final played in the stadium. The stadium also hosted 3 group games, 2 quarter-final matches, a semi-final and final. The attendance record of 92,706 for the match against the USSR was in 1960&lt;/ref&gt;. The capacity has since been reduced.Notable matches held in the stadium2008 UEFA Euro 2008 final: Spain 1 &amp;ndash; 0 Germany1995 UEFA Champions League final: Ajax 1 &amp;ndash; 0 AC Milan1994 UEFA Cup final: Inter Milan 1&amp;ndash; 0 SV Austria Salzburg1990 European Cup final: AC Milan 1 &amp;ndash; 0 Benfica1987 European Cup final: FC Porto 2 &amp;ndash; 1 Bayern München1970 European Cup Winners Cup final: Manchester City F.C. 2 &amp;ndash; 1 Górnik Zabrze1964 European Cup final: Inter Milan 3 &amp;ndash; 1 Real MadridUEFA Euro 2008The Ernst-Happel-Stadion hosted 7 games of EURO 2008: 3 group games, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final.DateTime (CET)Team #1ResultTeam #2RoundSpectators8 June 200818.00Austria0''' &ndash; '''1CroatiaGroup B]]51,42812 June 200820.45Austria1''' &ndash; '''1PolandGroup B]]51,42816 June 200820.45Austria0''' &ndash; '''1GermanyGroup B]]51,42820 June 200820.45Croatia1''' &ndash; '''1 aet(1 &ndash; 3 pen.)Turkeyquarter-finals]]51,42822 June 200820.45Spain0''' &ndash; '''0 aet(4 &ndash; 2 pen.)Italyquarter-finals]]48,00026 June 200820.45Russia0''' &ndash; '''3Spainsemi-final]]51,42829 June 200820.45Germany0''' &ndash; '''1Spainfinal]]51,428Other SportsOther sporting events are held in the stadium, including athletics, cycling and tennis.
