It is located in the province of Jämtland in modern Jämtland County. From Storsjön runs the river Indalsälven and the lake contains the major island Frösön. The city of Östersund is located on the east shore of the lake, opposite Frösön.Storsjön is said to be the home of the sea creature Storsjöodjuret, not unlike Nessie, and every now and then there are new reports of people having spotted it. Descriptions of the creature have varied over the years. Some have described it as being serpentine in appearance, with multiple humps, a feline or canine-like head and grayish skin. Others have claimed that the creature is short in stature and morbidly obese, with a roundish skull.External linksMap of Storsjön Category:Jämtland County Category:Lakes of Sweden Category:Lakes with rumoured lake monstersbg:Сторшьон ca:Storsjön cs:Storsjön da:Storsjön de:Storsjön es:Storsjön eo:Storsjön fr:Storsjön it:Storsjön lv:Stūršens hu:Storsjön nl:Storsjön no:Storsjön pl:Stor fi:Storsjön sv:Storsjön tr:Storsjön Gölü zh:斯圖爾湖
