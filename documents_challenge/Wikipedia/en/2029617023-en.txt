[[Image:EPR OLK3 lage.jpg|thumb|Computer generated view of an EPR power plant]] The EPR (or US-EPR for the United States specific design) is a third generation pressurized water reactor (PWR) design. It has been designed and developed mainly by Framatome (now Areva NP) and Electricité de France (EDF) in France, and Siemens AG in Germany. This reactor design was first called European Pressurized Reactor, and for a time given the internationalized name Evolutionary Power Reactor, but is now simply named EPR by Areva.As of 2007, two EPR units were under construction, one each in Finland and France. Two additional units were planned as part of China's tenth economic plan, to start construction in 2009. In July 2008 the French President announced a second EPR would be built in France due to high oil and gas prices.&lt;/ref&gt; A site for this is to be chosen in 2009 and construction should start in 2011.DesignThe main design objectives of the generation 3+ EPR design are increased safety while providing enhanced economic competitiveness through evolutionary improvements to previous PWR designs scaled up to an electrical power output of 1.6&nbsp;GWe. The reactor can use 5% enriched uranium oxide fuel, optionally with up to 50%&nbsp;mixed uranium plutonium oxide fuel. The EPR is the evolutionary descendant of the Framatome N4 and Siemens Power Generation Division KONVOI reactors.The EPR design has several active and passive protection measures against accidents:Four independent emergency cooling systems, each capable of cooling down the reactor after shutdown (ie. 300% redundancy).Leaktight containment around the reactor.An extra container and cooling area if a molten core manages to escape the reactor (see containment building).Two-layer concrete wall with total thickness 2.6&nbsp;meters, designed to withstand impact by aeroplanes and internal overpressure.The EPR has a design maximum core damage frequency of 6.1&nbsp;×&nbsp;10–7 per plant per year. EPR Level 1 Probabilistic Safety Assessment. Author: UK EPR.The Union of Concerned Scientists has referred to the EPR as the only new reactor design under consideration in the United States that "...appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than today's reactors." Pilot power plantThe Olkiluoto 3OLKILUOTO 3 PROJECT by AREVA power plant in Finland, initially scheduled to go online in 2009, CHRONOLOGY OF OLKILUOTO 3 PROJECT by AREVA, will be the first EPR reactor built and the first Generation 3+ reactor to be built in the world. The construction is a joint effort of French Areva and German Siemens AG through their common subsidiary Areva NP, for Finnish operator TVO. Initial cost estimates were about about €&nbsp;3.7&nbsp;billion.EPR IN FINLAND: FOUNDATION STONE-LAYING DAY AT OLKILUOTO 3 by AREVAProgressIn May 2006 construction delays of about one year were announced, following quality control problems across the construction. In part the delays were due to the lack of oversight of subcontractors inexperienced in nuclear construction.

Concrete composition delays Finland's Olkiluoto 3, Nuclear Engineering International, 9 May 2006. The delays led to disappointing financial results for the Areva NP. It blamed delays on the Finnish approach to approving technical documentation and designs.

In December 2006 TVO announced construction was about 18 months behind schedule so completion was now expected 2010–11, and there were reports that Areva was preparing to take a €&nbsp;500&nbsp;million charge on its accounts for the delay.

In August 2007 a further construction delay of up to a year was reported associated with construction problems in reinforcing the reactor building to withstand an airplane crash, and the timely supply of adequate documentation to the Finnish authorities.

Areva-Siemens sees Olkiluoto 3 reactor operational in summer 2011, CNN, 31 December 2007.Flamanville 3 (second unit) First concrete was poured for the demonstration EPR reactor at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant on December 6, 2007. Nuclear Engineering International. Flamanville 3 concrete poured. This will be the third unit on the site and the second EPR ever constructed. Electrical output will be 1.6 GWe and it is projected to cost 3.3 billion Euros.EDF Official Site - Flamanville 3 http://www.edf.fr/html/epr/uk/projet.html The following is a condensed timeline for the unit:From October 19, 2005 to February 18, 2006 the project was submitted to a national public debate.On May 4, 2006 the decision was made by EDF’s Board of Directors to continue with the construction.Between June 15 and July 31, 2006 the unit underwent a public enquiry, which rendered a "favorable opinion" on the project. &lt;/ref&gt;In Summer 2006 site preparation works began.In December 2007 construction of the unit itself began. This is expected to last 54 months.Final commissioning of the plant is planned for 2012.ProtestsOn March 17, 2007 simultaneous protests were staged by Sortir du nucléaire in five French towns to protest construction of EPR plants; Rennes, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, and Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;On April 26, 2007 (the 21st anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster) around 30 protesters blocked entrances and chained themselves to cranes at the EPR site in Flamanville, some remaining on the site for 24 hours. A truck was also parked in front of the entrance to block its access.&lt;/ref&gt;ProgressIn April 2008 the French nuclear safety agency (Autorité de sûreté nucléaire, ASN) reported that a quarter of the welds inspected in the secondary containment steel liner are not in accordance with norms, and that cracks have been found in the concrete base. EDF stated that progress is being made on these issues raised very early in construction, however on 21 May ASN ordered a suspension of concrete pouring on the site. A month later concreting work resumed after ASN accepted EDF's corrective action plan which included external oversight checks.Future power plantsAbu Dhabi In January 2008, French president Nicolas Sarkozy signed a deal that will allow two EPR units to be constructed in Abu Dhabi by Total, Suez and Areva. This will be the first entry of Total in the field of nuclear energy. Sarkozy confirms plans for UAE nuclear deal-paper - Lin Noueihed - The Guardian January 13 2008. China In 2006, there was a bidding in process to build four new EPR reactors in China, Foreign energy giants bid for China's nuclear contracts, September 12, 2004, People's Daily Online and an intent to market EPRs in the United States with Constellation Energy. Unistar Nuclear, September 15, 2005 In April 2006, Areva SA lost this bid in favor Westinghouse Electric Company to build four AP1000 reactors, because of its refusal to transfer the expertise and knowledge to China. Nevertheless in February 2007 Areva won another deal, worth about €&nbsp;5&nbsp;billion, for two other nuclear reactors located in Guangdong, in southern China in spite of sticking to its previous conditions.  The local partner for this project is China Guangdong Nuclear Power Co.In November 2007, French president Nicolas Sarkozy signed a $12&nbsp;billion deal that will allow the third and fourth EPR units to be constructed in China. Nuclear Engineering International. Record-breaking deal for Areva/China Guangdong.United Kingdom EDF said it will propose, in partnership with Areva, its EPR model of nuclear reactors to the UK government.&lt;/ref&gt;United States The US-EPR is one of the major competitors for the next generation of nuclear plants in the United States, along with the AP1000 and the ESBWR. It is currently in the Design Certification Application Review process at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with expectation to submit an application for final design approval and standard design certification on December 14, 2007. UniStar, Amarillo Power, PPL Corp and AmerenUE have announced plans to file a Combined Construction and Operating License application in 2008 for the US-EPR. Unistar filed a partial application in July 2007 for a proposed third unit at the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Maryland. Both UniStar and Amarillo Power have expressed interest in building two reactors while AmerenUE announced plans for just one.Uranium Information Centre.
