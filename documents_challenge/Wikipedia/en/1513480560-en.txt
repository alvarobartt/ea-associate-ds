This article is about the musical term "aria." For other meanings or uses of the word, see Aria (disambiguation).An aria (Italian for air; plural: arie or arias in common usage) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term is now used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice usually with orchestral accompaniment. Perhaps the most common context for arias is opera, although there are many arias that form movements of oratorios and cantatas. Composers also wrote 'concert arias', which are not part of any larger work, such as "Ah Perfido" by Beethoven, and a number of concert arias by Mozart.The aria first appeared in the 14th century when it signified a manner or style of singing or playing. Aria could also mean a melodic scheme (motif) or pattern for singing a poetic pattern, such as a sonnet. It was also attached to instrumental music, though this is no longer the case. Over time, arias evolved from simple melodies into a structured form; in about 17th century, the aria was written in ternary form (ABA); these arias were known as da capo arias. The aria later "invaded" the opera repertoire with its many sub-species (Aria cantabile, Aria agitata, Aria di bravura, and so on). By the mid-19th century, many operas became a sequence of arias, reducing the space left for recitative, while other operas (for instance those by Wagner) were entirely through-composed, with no section being readily identifiable as a self-contained aria.An arietta is a short aria.+Notable ariasVoice rangeAriaOperaComposersopranoO mio babbino caroGianni SchicchiGiacomo PucciniSì, mi chiamano MimìLa bohèmeGiacomo PucciniVissi d'arteToscaGiacomo PucciniDer Hölle RacheThe Magic FluteWolfgang Amadeus MozartSummertime]]''Porgy and BessGeorge Gershwinmezzo-sopranoHabanera]]''CarmenGeorges BizetMon cœur s'ouvre à ta voixSamson et DalilaCamille Saint-SaënsVoi, che sapeteLe nozze di FigaroWolfgang Amadeus MozartOmbra mai fuSerseGeorge Frideric HandeltenorLa donna è mobileRigolettoGiuseppe VerdiCeleste AidaAidaGiuseppe VerdiVesti la giubbaPagliacciRuggero LeoncavalloNessun dormaTurandotGiacomo PucciniE lucevan le stelleToscaGiacomo PuccinibaritoneLargo al factotumThe Barber of SevilleGioachino RossiniVotre toast]]'' (Toreador song)CarmenGeorges BizetDer Vogelfänger bin ich jaThe Magic FluteWolfgang Amadeus MozartbassNon più andraiThe Marriage of FigaroWolfgang Amadeus MozartO Isis und OsirisThe Magic FluteWolfgang Amadeus MozartMadamina, il catalogo è questoDon GiovanniWolfgang Amadeus Mozart+Notable operatic duetsVoice rangesAriaOperaComposertenor and sopranoLibiamo ne' lieti caliciLa traviataGiuseppe VerdiO soave fanciullaLa bohèmeGiacomo PucciniParle-moi de ma mèreCarmenGeorges Bizettenor and mezzo-sopranoGià i sacerdoti adunansiAidaGiuseppe Verditenor and baritoneO Mimì, tu più non torniLa bohèmeGiacomo Puccinisoprano and mezzo-sopranoChe soave ZeffirettoThe Marriage of FigaroWolfgang Amadeus Mozartsoprano and mezzo-sopranoScuoti quella fronda di ciliegioMadama ButterflyGiacomo Puccinisoprano and contraltoThe Flower DuetLakméLéo DelibesMedia   See alsoAir (music)RecitativeExternal linksThe Aria DatabaseCategory:Song forms Category:Opera terminology * Category:Italian loanwordsbs:Arija bg:Ария ca:Ària (música) cs:Árie da:Arie de:Arie et:Aaria el:Άρια es:Aria eo:Ario fr:Aria ko:아리아 hr:Arija it:Aria (musica) he:אריה (מוזיקה) ka:არია kk:Ария lt:Arija ms:Aria nl:Aria (compositie) ja:アリア no:Arie pl:Aria pt:Ária ru:Ария simple:Aria sk:Ária sl:Arija fi:Aaria sv:Aria tr:Arya uk:Арія zh:詠嘆調
