  Nezahualpilli (Nahuatl for "fasting prince"; 1464-1515) was ruler (tlatoani) of the Mesoamerican city-state of Texcoco, elected by the city's nobility after the death of his father, Nezahualcoyotl, in 1473.Like his father, he was a poet, was considered a sage, and had the reputation of being a fair ruler. Only one of his poems survives: "Icuic Nezahualpilli yc tlamato huexotzinco" ("Song of Nezahualpilli during the war with Huexotzinco"). His court was a haven for astronomers, engineers, and soothsayers. During his reign, he abolished capital punishment for a number of crimes and struggled to keep the political independence of Texcoco during the increasing centralization of Aztec power in Tenochtitl√°n.When he told Moctezuma II that the Texcocan wise men had foretold foreign dominion over the Valley of Mexico, the emperor challenged him to a ball game. Moctezuma considered the loss of the game a negative omen.Fehrenbach (1973), p.103He married a daughter of Moctezuma II only to later have her executed. Her public improprieties and high social status qualified her for a punishment that would not have been applicable to someone of a lower status. He was said to have taken numerous consorts and fathered 144 children.Nezahualpilli was succeeded by his son Cacama.NotesReferences  Category:1464 births Category:1515 deaths Category:Tlatoque Category:Texcoco Category:Nahuatl-language poetsde:Nezahualpilli es:Nezahualpilli fr:Nezahualpilli nl:Nezahualpilli pl:Nezahualpilli
