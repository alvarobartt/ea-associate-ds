After the manga became a success, Beyblade was made into an anime, that premeried in Japan, and was later dubbed and played in several other countries. Beyblade had three seasons, a few video games and a vast line of merchandise. The show originally was broadcast from 2001 and ended in 2004 in Japan, with an attempt to revive the franchise in summer of 2008http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-04-08/beyblade-anime-to-return-after-4-years-this-summer. The anime is aimed at younger elementary/primary-school aged children. It is a Shōnen anime.Aoki's most well-known work is Beyblade, which became a franchise around children who battle with spinning tops. He also made "Bakufu Slash;Kizna", "A War Story of Metal Walker" and "Mini-4WD Fighter V". Most of Aoki's manga revolve around video games or toys. His works are highly liked.CharactersAnime detailsBakuten Shoot Beyblade is an anime and manga series about a group of children battling with highly powerful spinning tops enchanted with Holy Beasts or spirits of mythical and powerful creatures. The show focuses on the battles between Beyblading teams as they compete to become the world champions. The main characters are the Bladebreakers, a team consisting of Tyson Granger, Kai Hiwatari, Ray Kon and Max Tate. During their quest to become Beyblade champions, Tyson and his friends meet many new friends, enemies and competitors whilst overcoming problems. The Beyblade anime is licensed by Nelvana in North America. They have also announced that there will be a new generation of beyblades.Both "Bakuten Shoot Beyblade" and "Metal Fight Beyblade" are two completely different Beyblade series altogether. There has been some confusion amongst Beyblade fans about season 4. There are only 3 seasons of the Bakuten Shoot Beyblade series, and it is complete. The new Beyblade series "Metal Fight Beyblade" season 1 will begin its first episode in January 2009. Most likely, the new series will have a completely new story and cast. Currently it is unknown how many episodes the Metal Fight series will have or if it will be 51 episodes per season again like it was in Bakuten Shoot.Metal Fight Beyblade!The April 8 issue of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) paper reports that Tomy is reviving the Beyblade franchise after a four-year hiatus this August, and will sponsor a new accompanying Beyblade anime starting January, 2009. Tomy is aiming for 20 billion yen (about US $200 million) in yearly revenue by next year and will improve the new tops by making them out of metal instead of plastic. Beyblade has another manga coming, but this time it will not be written by Takao Aoki. Instead, it will be written by Adachi Takafumi.Takara launched the game franchise in 1999, and sponsored three anime series between 2001 and 2003: Beyblade, Beyblade V-Force, and Beyblade G-Revolution. Nelvana released all three in Canada and the United States, with the last new episode airing in 2005. Viz Media released Takao Aoki's manga spinoff.MediaMerchandiseBeyblade had a cult following in 2002 and 2003 by many children when the series' popular spinning top toy was released and became a fadLycos 50 - Beyblade, The Other Toy Fad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;. It locked into place on a stand until a person "ripped" the cord through causing the toy to fall and spin. Oftentimes the tops had designs on them and had rough edges allowing them to battle other beyblades.Movie is chronologically set between second and third seasons, even though Daichi appears in the movie. A new Beyblade team named Shadow Bladers (consisting of new beybladers Steven, Ashley, Daniel, and Henry) was introduced.After Tyson won Japanese BBA tournament, Daichi challenges him inside the stadium. Meanwhile, Professor Tengai discovers an ancient warning of the dark spirits inside a cave on the island. When Daichi's Beyblade starts glowing during the beybattle, the dark bit beast from the Demon Rock Island starts possessing Tengai's students. The Shadow Bladers seek Daichi's bit beast, Strata Dragoon, in order to release the bit beasts from the ruins. After the Shadow Bladers captured Daichi and Strata Dragoon, the dark bit beasts possess Daichi and are intent to reunite with the four sacred beasts, Dragoon, Dranzer, Driger, and Draciel.The original movie storyline was also featured in volume 14 of the Beyblade manga books, but ended on a cliff hanger due to being released on DVD. Characters in the original timeline also include China, Ping Pong, and SareniaVHS/DVD ReleasesThe popularity of Beyblade in Japan was popular enough to have VHS and DVD releases of the show. In Japan all of the episodes have been released on VHS and DVD. The Beyblade 2001 DVDs first two volumes had three episodes a piece and were sold new at 4,200 yen per DVD. The rest of season one that had five episodes were sold new at 5,500 yen. The Japanese Beyblade DVDs first season titles were Called SHOOT (plus the volume number). The Beyblade 2002 DVDs were released in two separate titles. Blader Project (Vol 1~10) and BB Victory (Vol 1~8). G Revolution the volumes were called by the series name G Revolution and the volume number. There are 17 DVD volumes in G Revolution.When Beyblade got dubbed by Nelvana, the USA DVDs all of the first season were only released in Nelvana TV dub edited. The second season V-Force DVDs have only got released in Australia in a box set of 12 episodes for now at least. When Beyblade G Revolution was the next season that Nelvana dubbed, Funimation released them on DVD. Volumes one to four were edited-only English dub, but then due to fan outcry, Volume five onwards contains the original Japanese episodes as well as the dubbed version. Volume five and six were released but no new releases have been confirmed.Video gamesThere have been several video games based on the show, spanning the Game Boy Advance and the PlayStation. However, as is the case with many video games based on licensed properties these games have been critically panned. A DS game titled Metal Fight Beyblade DS is to be released Spring 2009. Strangely, its not being produced by Takara Tomy but by HudsonGameNavi. http://www.hudson.co.jp/gamenavi/gamedb/index.cgi?mode=info&amp;f=ds_beiBeyblade V Force Adventure (Game Boy Advance)Beyblade (Game Boy Color, Japan Only)Beyblade (PlayStation)Beyblade 2 (PlayStation, Japan Only)BeyBlade: Super Tournament Battle (GameCube)Beyblade: GRevolution (Game Boy Advance),Beyblade Ultimate Blader Jam (Game Boy Advance)Bakuten Shoot Beyblade 2002: Takao Version (Game Boy Advance, Japan Only)Bakuten Shoot Beyblade 2002: Daichi Version (Game Boy Advance, Japan Only)Beyblade V-Force 2 In 1 TV Game (Plug-and-Play)Broadcasting Blocking IssuesTurkey: ATV TurkeyBrazil: Jetix (and some time ago, Globo(TV Xuxa's block), but not any more.)Denmark: Cartoon Network (Toonami block)Pakistan: Cartoon Network (Toonami)(not broadcasted any more)Ireland: RTÉ Two (The Den block)Mexico: JETIX and Canal 5(not broadcast anymore)Morocco: 2M (nowadays not broadcasted)Nepal:Ntv Poland: Jetix (and some time ago, Polsat, but not any more.)Portugal: TVI and Canal PandaNetherlands: Yorin, Toonami, Fox Kids, JETIX (not anymore)United Kingdom: Toonami, Five, S4C (In wales/Welsh language only on Planed Plant), Cartoon Network (2002 - 2004), POP (January 28, 2008 - June 23, 2008), Kix!

The most notable of the changes include:The phrase "Go Shoot" was replaced with "Let it Rip", possibly to avoid references to gun violence, but the official reasoning is unknown.New intro/opening sequences containing scenes from episodes and the original intro/opening sequences.Several characters' names were changed, many characters having their Japanese names changed to English alternatives. The original ones can be found on the list of Beyblade characters.Instrumental soundtracks were changed to punk and metal style music, with lyrics. There wasn't any original Japanese soundtrack remaining.Sound effects are changed to familiar American sound effects. There weren't any original Japanese sound effects remaining.Logos originally displayed in Japanese were redesigned in English.In V-Force dubbing, the name of Ray's new beyblade Driger-V was mistakenly(?) called "Driger 5". However, the "V" actually stands for "Vulcan". But seeing as "V" is the Roman numeral for "5", it's easy to guess how this mix-up occurred.AJ Topper and Brad Best were added to make comments about the tournaments. They did not exist in the original instead, Blader DJ filled this role.Kenny's bitbeast, Dizzara (aka "Dizzi"), was added for comic relief during the first two seasons. It was said in the dub version that she accidentally entered his laptop causing her to speak. Dizzi did not appear in the third season.Before every official fight, a small scene talking about the bladers and the stadium appears. First, it shows the stadium, in different angles, with its name. Then it shows an image of the blader, his/her attack, defense and endurance points, name and special attack. An image and name of the bit beast also appears.Elements of the dialogue were also changed.Every episode and season had its title changed from its Japanese counterpart, except for the third season's title (G-Revolution).Many team names were changed in the English dub. (e.g. Team BBA was changed to Bladebreakers). The only two teams to not have their names changed were the BBA Revolution and BEGA (also known as Justice 5), both of which come from the third season Beyblade G-RevolutionOriginally the Beyblade name and the bit-beast name was different; for example, instead of Dragoon for both the blade and the bit-beast, it was Dragoon for the blade and Seiryuu for the bit-beast.The characters were younger in the original with Tyson starting the series at ten instead of twelve, with the rest of the team aged accordingly.Fan reaction to these changes were mixed. Hardcore fans disliked the dubbed version of Beyblade and used the original Japanese versions as references instead. It should be noted that in the pilot, Tyson says winder, the original name of the tool, rather than ripcord. It should also be noted that in V-Force, whenever a bit-beasts' data was shown, its original name is shown (e.g. Seiryu rather than Dragoon).Seasonal ThemesFirst season:Let's Beyblade (opening theme) - Lukas RossiNever gonna take me down - Anthony VanderburghLet's go Beybladers - Krystal BandHeavyweight Generation BeybladesAll Across the Nation - The Black EuropeansSwing LowSecond season:Underdog - MuddAlways be in the game - Jason Dean BennisonSwitchblade - LenzThird season:Rise Above the StormI'm Not Going DownHang OnExternal linksEnglishBeyblade official websiteJETIX U.S. Beyblade websiteYTV Beyblade websiteHasbro Beyblade website         JapaneseMetal Fight Beyblade Official Takara homepage Official d-rights homepage Takara Toys' Beyblade website Category:Anime series Category:Anime of 2001 Category:Anime of 2002 Category:Anime of 2003 * Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Sports anime and manga Category:Manga series Category:YTV shows Category:Viz Media manga Category:Madhouse Category:Geneon Beyblade spinning top Category:Kodomo anime and mangaar:بي بليد da:Beyblade de:Beyblade el:Beyblade es:Beyblade fr:Beyblade id:Beyblade it:Beyblade he:בייבלייד ms:Beyblade nl:Beyblade ja:爆転シュート ベイブレード (アニメ) pl:Beyblade pt:Beyblade (anime) fi:Beyblade sv:Beyblade th:เบย์เบลด (อะนิเมะ) tr:Beyblade zh:戰鬥陀螺
