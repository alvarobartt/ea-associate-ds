   1616 drawings of the Moon and its phases. Monday is named after the Moon in many cultures.]] Monday (pron. ) is a day of the week between Sunday and Tuesday.Etymology, the personified moon, and his sister Sól, the personified sun, from Norse mythology (1895) by Lorenz Frølich.]] The English noun Monday derived sometime before 1200 from monedæi, which itself developed from Old English (around 1000) mōnandæg and mōndæg (literally meaning "day of the moon"), which is cognate to other Germanic languages, including Old Frisian mōnadeig, Middle Low German and Middle Dutch mānendach (modern Dutch Maandag), Old High German mānetag (modern German Montag), and Old Norse mānadagr (Swedish måndag, and Danish and Norwegian manadag). The Germanic term is a Germanic interpretation of Latin lunae dies ("day of the moon").Barnhart (1995:485).The Russian word, eschewing pagan names, is понедельник (poniediélnik), meaning "after Sunday." In most of the Indian Languages, the word for Monday is Somvar, with Soma being the Sanskrit name for the moon. The Japanese word for Monday is getsuyōbi (月曜日) which means day of the moon.Position in the weekIn some cultures, Monday is held to be the first day of the week. In Asia – because the western calendar system was introduced only during the 20th century – many languages refer to Monday as the "day of the beginning". For example, Monday is xingqi yi (星期一) in Chinese, meaning day one of the week. The international standard, ISO 8601, defines Monday as the first day of the week.But according to the Judeo-Christian count, Monday is the second day, the first being Sunday. This is also the standard format in Canada and the United States. Its name in Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Persian, Portuguese and Syriac means "second day". Quakers also traditionally refer to Monday as "Second Day" eschewing the pagan origin of the English name "Monday". For similar reasons the official liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church refers to Monday as "Feria II". (The Portuguese name for Monday reflects this, as do all the days' names except Saturday and Sunday: the Portuguese word for Monday is segunda-feira.)Modern culture usually looks at Monday as the beginning of the workweek, as it is typically Monday when adults go back to work and children back to school after the weekend. Thus, Mondays are often seen as a misfortune. In Middle Eastern countries, however, the beginning of the workweek is usually Saturday (Thursday and Friday are observed as the weekend). In Israel, Sunday is the first day of the workweek. Friday is half a work day and Friday night and Saturday are the Sabbath.Religious observancesIn Judaism and Islam Mondays are considered auspicious days for fasting. The Didache warned early Christians not to fast on Mondays to avoid Judaizing, and suggests Wednesdays instead.In Judaism the Torah is read in public on Monday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Monday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.In the Eastern Orthodox Church Mondays are days on which the Angels are commemorated. The Octoechos contains hymns on this theme, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Mondays throughout the year. At the end of Divine Services on Monday, the dismissal begins with the words: "May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the honorable, Bodiless Powers (i.e., the angels) of Heaven…". In many Eastern monasteries Mondays are observed as fast days; because Mondays are dedicated to the angels, and monks strive to live an angelic life. In these monasteries the monks abstain from meat, fowl, dairy products, fish, wine and oil (if a feast day occurs on a Monday, fish, wine and oil may be allowed, depending upon the particular feast).Cultural referencesIn the folk rhyme, "Monday's child is fair of face".In Thailand, the color associated with Monday is yellow, see Thai solar calendarThe Boomtown Rats have a famous song called "I Don't Like Mondays".Through the movie Office Space the quote "Someone is having a case of the Mondays!" entered the pop culture lexicon.In the Garfield Comics and Shows, one of the things Garfield hates is MondayMonday in different languages+Names for Monday in different languages and cultures (Auswahl)LanguagePronunciationMeaningNotesLatindies lunaeDay of the moon(literal translation)AlbanianE HaneDay of the moon(literal translation)ItalianlunedìDay of the moon(literal translation)GalicianlunsDay of the moon(literal translation)CatalandillunsDay of the moon(literal translation)SpanishlunesDay of the moon(literal translation)FrenchlundiDay of the moon(literal translation)GermanMontagMoon day(literal translation)EnglishMondayMoon day(literal translation)Hungarianhétfőhead of seven (=week)beginning of the weekRussianПонедельник Ponedel'nikafter the week(literal translation)PolishPoniedziałekafter Sunday(literal translation)KashubianPòniedzôłkafter Sunday(literal translation)Khmerថ្ងៃច័ន្ទ​​ tngae chanmoon day(literal translation)CroatianPonedjeljakafter Sunday(literal translation)BulgarianПонеделник Ponedelnikafter Sunday(literal translation)UkrainianПонеділок Ponedilnokafter Sunday(literal translation)Czechpondělíafter Sunday(literal translation)SerbianПонедељак / Ponedelyakafter Sunday(literal translation)SlovakPondelokafter Sunday(literal translation)SlovenianPonedeljekafter Sunday(literal translation)BosnianPonedjeljakafter Sunday(literal translation)MacedonianПонеделник Ponedelnikafter Sunday(literal translation)TurkishPazartesiafter Sunday(literal translation)Kurdishdúschemsecond day(literal translation)GreekΔευτέραdeutérathe second (day)(literal translation)Arabicالاثنين al-ithnaynthe second (day)(literal translation)Persianدوشنبه do-schambethe second day(literal translation)Hebrewיום שניyom schenaithe second day(literal translation)Portuguesesegunda-feirasecond (liturgical) celebration(literal translation)Chinese礼拜一星期一libaiyi xingqiyifirst day of the weekJapanese月曜日getsuyôbimoon dayJapanese days are called by the names of celestial bodies, starting with sun and moon then five planetsKorean월요일walyoilmoon dayHindiसोमवारsom-vaarday of Soma(literal translation) the sacrament/deity soma was associated with the moon as the moon's waxing symbolized the cup of soma fillingMalayalamതി‍‍‍ങ്കളാഴ്ചthingka-lazhtchaday of the moonmoon-weekCommon occurencesAstrologyNamed daysBig MondayBlack MondayBlue MondayClean Monday (Ash Monday)Cyber MondayEaster Monday also Bright Monday or Wet MondayFirst MondayHandsel MondayMiracle MondayPlough MondayShrove MondayWeather Market Monday.
