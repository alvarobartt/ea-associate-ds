He now co-owns the Andretti Green Racing team in the Indy Racing League. He qualified eleventh for the 2007 Indianapolis 500 after finishing third in the 2006 Indianapolis 500. He is the son of Mario Andretti who is one of the most successful auto racing drivers of all time.Racing careerEarly careerDespite the fact he came from a racing family he started racing in 1984 driving a Formula Vee car in Local SCCA events, he won six of the 11 Super Vee races and went on to win the championship.Texaco/Havoline CART History Michael Andretti After that, he went into Formula Atlantic, where he won the Formula Atlantic Championship.CARTDuring that same year, he made his CART debut and also finished third in the Le Mans 24 Hours. In 1984, he won the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award. He went on to win his first IndyCar race in 1986 at Long Beach, finishing that year as championship runner-up after collecting other wins at Milwaukee and Phoenix.Andretti achieved major title success by winning the 1991 CART/PPG IndyCar World Series for Newman/Haas Racing. He won 8 of 17 races; Milwaukee, Toronto, Vancouver, the Marlboro Challenge, and all 5 permament road course events (Portland, Cleveland, Mid-Ohio, Road America, and Laguna Seca).Futility at [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]]The Andretti family's bad luck at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is known as the Andretti Curse. As a driver, he is largely remembered for being unlucky at the Indianapolis 500. In 1991, he led with twelve laps remaining, but finished second to Rick Mears after battling the multiple Indy 500 winner. In 1992, he dominated the race, leading a full four-fifths of the laps, but, with eleven laps remaining, his fuel pump failed, and his car coasted to a stop. He finished in 13th place. He also dropped out while leading the Indy 500 in 1989, 1995 and 2003. Michael holds the record for most laps led in the Indy 500 without having achieved a victory.Formula OneAfter his 1991 CART title win, Andretti joined the McLaren Formula One team for 1993, alongside the triple World Champion Ayrton Senna. Unfortunately, the season was not a success. A string of collisions meant that he only completed three laps in his first three races, and he never fully got to grips with Formula One cars. Highly technical aspects which he was not used to in the technologically simpler IndyCars such as active suspension and traction control hampered Andretti's chances for the 1993 F1 season. This combined with the fact that he commuted to races and test sessions from the USA, rather than re-locating full-time to Europe were also contributing factors to his lack of success in Formula One. Three points-scoring finishes, including a third place at Monza, were perceived as too little, too late, and he left the team and the series by mutual agreement after that race.However, according to son Marco, the McLaren team Andretti drove for "sabotaged" his chances at being competitive in order to replace him with Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen, who would require a smaller salary. "The reality of it was, they had Mika Häkkinen ready to come in for a lot less than what my dad was getting paid, and that's all it was. Right then and there, they had to make him look bad," claimed Marco in 2008. "They would make the car do weird things in the corner electronically, stuff out of his control. I think my dad's biggest supporter over there was Ayrton Senna. Because he was one of the few who knew what was really happening in the team, and I think he believed in my father. It was Monza that he really said, 'Give him my car. Give him exactly what I had.'"Andretti: F1 team tried to ’sabotage’ dad’s career Northwest Herald Retrieved 29 June 2008 However, Andretti still had problems in practice at Monza, and both he and Senna spun off with brake balance problems early in the race. Andretti was able to continue and fought back up to third, holding off Karl Wendlinger. Throughout the season, Senna experienced similar reliability problems to Andretti, mainly eletronic gremlins, particularly in San Marino, Canada, Hungary and Belgium. http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/ita/okeefe.html "Atlas F1 - Man for One Season" Retrieved 29 June 2008 After Andretti's departure, both Senna and Häkkinen continued to have reliability issues, http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr546.html 1993 Portuguese GP report http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr548.html 1993 Australian GP report although Häkkinen equalled Andretti's third place Monza finish in Japan.At the start of the 1993 season, Ron Dennis signed Häkkinen as a backup to Senna, who was initially reluctant to commit to the team for the whole season. F1 Rejects states that this created a difficult atmosphere for Andretti, who would be in the shadow of the three-time F1 champion Senna, and also faced the threat of being replaced by Häkkinen.Michael Andretti F1 Rejects Retrieved 29 June 2008Regardless of the true nature of Andretti's unsuccessful Formula 1 season, however, he never returned to the cockpit in that series.Return to CARTAfter McLaren replaced Andretti with Häkkinen, Michael returned to the CART series for 1994 and drove for Chip Ganassi, where he once again proved very successful. He went on to win in his very first race back in the series at the Surfers Paradise event in Australia, having led every lap along the way. That win also got Reynard's first win in CART in their debut. In 1995 he retunrned to Newman/Haas Racing. He finished as runner-up to Jimmy Vasser in 1996 and more race wins followed in the years to come, but his 1991 championship success remained his only title in CART/IndyCar racing.His career in CART ended in 2002, in which he took his 42nd and final career victory at the Long Beach Grand Prix - placing him in third place for all-time victories in championship car racing behind his father, Mario Andretti (52 wins) and A.J. Foyt (67 wins).Michael Andretti is also tied with Al Unser, Jr. for the most wins in a CART/IndyCar season with eight victories. He achieved this during his championship-winning season of 1991.Sports carsdriven in the 24 Hours of Daytona]] Michael has driven in numerous sports car races at different times in his career. Many were Andretti family efforts, especially with his father Mario.Semi-retirement and team ownerAfter competing in the 2003 Indianapolis 500, Andretti retired from full-time IndyCar racing. He led the race for 28 of the opening 94 laps before a throttle linkage failure put him out of contention once again. That year he bought into the "Team Green" squad run by brothers Kim and Barry Green in CART. It became Andretti Green Racing and for 2003 the team moved to the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series.That year, Tony Kanaan won the 2004 IndyCar Series Championship for Andretti Green Racing. In 2005, Britain's Dan Wheldon won the Indy 500, and the Championship for the team. In 2007 Scotland's Dario Franchitti won the Indianapolis 500 and the IndyCar Series title for AGR.Return to racing at IndyAndretti returned to the driver's seat for the 2006 Indianapolis 500 in an one-time effort to assist the development of his son, Marco, an IndyCar rookie for the '06 season. Michael led the race with four laps to go, before falling to second behind his son a lap later. He went on to finish third, while Marco only just missed out on the 500 victory after he was passed just before the start/finish line on the last lap by three-time Indycar champion Sam Hornish, Jr.After qualifying his car in 11th place for the 2007 Indianapolis 500, Andretti went on to finish 13th. He then announced that this would be his last Indy 500 as a driver.Andretti leaves driving competition at Indy with a frustrating distinction - the driver who's led the most laps (431) without winning the race. He competed in 16 Indy 500s, with a top finish of second in 1991, but led the race nine times.As a car owner, however, he has far more success. In 2005, only three years after Andretti acquired primary ownership of the team, Andretti-Green Racing (AGR) saw its first 500 triumph come from Dan Wheldon in the #26 Klein Tools Special entry, and in 2007 an even stronger second victory, from Scottish driver Dario Franchitti in the #27 Canadian Club-sponsored car, who won the rain-shortened event at the completion of 166 of the scheduled 200 laps, but after another AGR team driver, Tony Kanaan, had himself led half of the eventual laps, and showed potential of renewing his challenge for supremacy after a fourth turn late-race incident.Personal lifeAndretti was married to Sandra Spinozzi from November 1985 to 1996 and they had two children, son Marco (born March 13, 1987) and daughter Marissa (born October 31, 1990). He remarried on December 24, 1997, to Leslie Wood. They had a child, Luca, born September 16, 1999. On September 7 2004, Andretti filed for divorce. Two years later on July 15 2006, Andretti announced his engagement to model, actress, and 2000 Playboy Playmate of the Year Jodi Ann Paterson. The couple were married on October 7, 2006 at the Andretti Winery in Napa Valley, California.Andretti familyMichael is from the famous Andretti racing family. His brother Jeff Andretti competed in IndyCar. Michael's uncle Aldo Andretti was an open wheel racer until an accident ended his racing career. Aldo's son John Andretti (Michael's cousin) raced in IndyCar before he became a NASCAR regular. He returned to IndyCar in 2007 to race the Indy 500, and will race in the 2008 edition too. Aldo's other son, Adam also is a racecar driver. The Andretti family became the first family to have four relatives (Michael, Mario, Jeff, and John) compete in the same series (CART).Michael Andretti has an estate upon an adjacent tract of land to his father's mansion of "Montona" in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where he grew up. However that property was listed for sale in January 2008 for $3.4 million.Story not found - NJ.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; His sister Barbara is the listing agent and said Michael has several other homes and will always have a Nazareth connection. Michael's other homes include a property in downtown Indianapolis where his son lives(near his championship race team headquarters) , a residence in Miami Beach, and several other properties for investment purposes.Motorsports Career ResultsAmerican Open Wheel ([[1983 CART World Series season|1983]]-[[1992 CART World Series season|1992]])(key) (Races in bold indicates pole
