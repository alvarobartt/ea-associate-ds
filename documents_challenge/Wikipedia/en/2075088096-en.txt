It has won a record number of national titles and is the only Chilean team to have won the Copa Libertadores de América (1991). Colo-Colo is known as the "Albos" (snow whites), "Cacique", "El Indio" (the indian) and "Eterno Campeón" (eternal champion). The traditional uniform consists of a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. After the death of David Arellano a founding father, black was added to the top of the emblem on the white shirt as a tribute. In a dual sign the name of the stadium was also dedicated to him as a living memory. Colo-Colo plays in the Chilean commune of Macul located within Santiago. It is managed since 2005 by Blanco y Negro S.A.Colo-Colo has won a combined total of 48 titles, encompassing 4 amateur titles, 41 national tournaments in the professional era and 3 international championships.

A breakdown in negotiations provoked a few of the younger players to resign from the team after encountering opposition from the club's directors, established players, and fans.After a series of reunions the former club Magallanes players led by David Arellano decided to establish their new club creating Colo-Colo on April 19, 1925, naming the club for a Chilean Mapuche chief. The individuals involved included, the Arellano brothers, David and Francisco; Juan Quiñones (who designed the team uniform and colors); Luis Contreras (who came up with the name); Rubén and Nicolás Arroyo; Clemente Acuña; Guillermo Garcés; Rubén Sepúlveda; Eduardo Stavelton; and Luis Mancilla.

This was the first tournament that Colo-Colo entered and successfully completed. 1927 featured Colo-Colo as the first Chilean club team to go on tour across Europe to participate in a round of friendly games. Tragedy struck on May 2, 1927, in an exhibition match against Real Valladolid of Spain where team captain and founder David Arellano was critically injured after suffering a foul that caused him to experience Peritonitis. The inflammation would cause him to die the next day.http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0006536.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the huge loss, the club carried on and won the (Primera División de la Liga Central de Football) championships in 1928, 1929, and 1930.During the years 1931-32 the club experienced their first institutional crisis when the directors wanted to invest a large amount of money in newer players. The new acquisitions did not render the team any positive results, therefore creating a decrease in salaries throughout the rest of the squad.On December 8, 1932 Colo-Colo returned to play another championship final against Santiago based club Audax Italiano. As Colo-Colo was winning 2-1, a platform in the Audax Italiano stadium collapsed as fans were trying to rush the field of play. The match was canceled and the champion for that year remained vacant. The tragedy resulted in 130 injuries and 3 deaths.  Salinas, Sebastián: «Crisis adentro, crisis afuera», en Por Empuje Y Coraje. Los Albos en la época amateur 1925-1933.
