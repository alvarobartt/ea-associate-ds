Jordan Pundik (vocals) met Steve Klein (guitars) and began writing music together. They recruited Ian Grushka on bass, practicing in his garage, and Joe Moreno on drums. Soon after they recruited Chad Gilbert, former singer of Shai Hulud.The band’s first release was 1997’s It’s All About the Girls EP on Fiddler Records. Soon after the recording of the EP, Moreno was replaced by current drummer Cyrus Bolooki and the band was picked up by Eulogy Records. They released their debut full-length Nothing Gold Can Stay; the album’s release coupled with a rigorous touring schedule soon earned the band a significant following.2000 - 2006Independent label Drive-Thru Records took notice of the band’s growing fanbase and signed them to a deal. In 2000, NFG released an EP of cover songs entitled From the Screen to Your Stereo in 2000. Drive-Thru’s relationship with MCA Records ensured that the smaller label’s more popular bands would be picked up by the major; subsequently, their self-titled record was released by MCA. Their third studio album, Sticks and Stones, was released in 2002, coinciding with an appearance on the Vans Warped Tour.After a period of relative quiet and a stint on the Honda Civic Tour with Good Charlotte, New Found Glory released Catalyst in May of 2004. It debuted at number three on the Billboard album chart, selling 146,000 copies in its first week.The heavier sound of the record, according to Gilbert, was due to the comparisons magazines and other media outlets would make between NFG and other bands:After the release and tour in support of Catalyst, the band took an extended break before beginning preproduction for another album in 2005. On June 14, 2006, Gilbert announced to MTV.com that their fifth album would be titled Coming Home and that it was scheduled to be released on September 19, 2006. He also stated that first single, "It's Not Your Fault" would be released sometime in July 2006.Their song, "This Disaster", was featured in EA Sport's Madden 2005.2007 - PresentFrom the Screen to Your Stereo Part II, the band's follow-up to From the Screen to Your Stereo, was released on September 18 2007.
