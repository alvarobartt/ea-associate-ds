He grew up in a  flat.&lt;/ref&gt;Medvedev was an A and B student at the secondary school. His future wife, Svetlana Linnik, was his classmate.

A18.Business and political career before presidencyFrom 1991 to 1996 Medvedev worked as a legal expert for the International Relations Committee (IRC) of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office headed by Vladimir Putin. According to the research of critics of Putin's regime, Yuri Felshtinsky and Vladimir Pribylovsky, the committee was involved in numerous business activities including gambling. The connection with gambling business was established through a municipal enterprise called Neva Chance.Yuri Felshtinsky and Vladimir Pribylovsky The Age of Assassins. The Rise and Rise of Vladimir Putin, Gibson Square Books, London, 2008, ISBN 190-614207-6, pages 65-65 and 155-157.

The mayor's office contributed its share not in money, but "by relinquishing the right to collect rent for the facilities that the casinos occupied." The authors concluded that Medvedev "was one of the first people ... in Russia as a whole, who figured out how the government could "join" a joint stock company without breaking existing laws: not by contributing land or real estate, but by contributing rents on land and real estate." The Committee headed by Putin was under investigation for illegal commercial operations by a St. Petersburg parliament committee. The committee recommended that Putin be removed from the office and his activities were investigated by the prosecutors.In November 1993, Medvedev became the legal affairs director of Ilim Pulp Enterprise, a St. Petersburg-based timber company. This enterprise was initially registered as a limited liability partnership, and then re-registered as a closed joint stock company Fincell, "50% of whose shares were owned by Dmitry Medvedev."
