 ,   ) ]]  Ski jumping is a sport in which skiers go down an "inrun" with a take-off ramp (the jump), attempting to go as far as possible. In addition to the length that skiers jump, judges give points for style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (240 to 270 cm). Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport, performed on snow, and is part of the Winter Olympic Games, but can also be performed in summer on artificial surfaces (porcelain or frost rail track on the inrun, plastic on the landing hill).HistorySki jumping originates from Morgedal, Norway, but the first proper competition was held in Trysil in 1862. The first widely known ski jumping competition was the Husebyrennene, held in Oslo from 1879. The annual event was moved to Holmenkollen from 1892, and Holmenkollen has remained the pinnacle of ski jumping venues.Competition, Canada.]] Today, World Cup ski jumping competitions are held on three types of hills:Normal hill competitionsfor which the calculation line is found at approximately 80-100m. Distances of up to and over 110 metres can be reached.Large hill competitionsfor which the calculation line is found at approximately 120-130m. Distances of over 145 m can be obtained on the larger hills. Both individual and team competitions are run on these hills.Ski-flying competitionsfor which the calculation line is found at 185 m. The Ski Flying World Record is currently held by Bjørn Einar Romøren (239m), set in Planica (SLO) in March 2005.Amateur and junior competitions are held on smaller hills.Individual Olympic competition consists of a training jump and two scored jumps. The team event consists of four members of the same nation who have two jumps each.Ski jumping is one of the two elements in the Nordic combined sport.Women's ski jumpingCurrently, women ski jump internationally in the Continental cup. On May 26, 2006, the International Ski Federation decided to allow women to ski jump at the 2009 Nordic World Ski Championships in Liberec, Czech Republic and then to have a team event for women at the 2011 world championships. FIS also decided to submit a proposal to the International Olympic Committee to allow women to compete at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/newsinformation/pressreleases/pressreleases2006/gacongressdecisions.html FIS MEDIA INFO: Decisions of the 45th International Ski Congress in Vilamoura/Algarve (POR) On November 28, 2006, the proposal was rejected by the Executive Board of the IOC. The reason for the rejection cited the low number of athletes as well as few participating countries in the sport. The Executive Board noted that women's ski jumping has yet to be fully established internationally.http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/28/sports/ME_SPT_OLY_IOC_Meetings.php IOC approves skicross; rejects women's ski jumping Currently there are 135+ athletes competing on an international level, which is more than snowcross and ski cross. Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee states that they don't allow women ski jumpers in the Olympics because "We do not want the medals to be diluted and watered down," referring to the relatively small number of potential competitors in women's ski jumping.CTV.ca | Rogge: Women jumpers would dilute Olympics medals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Meanwhile, the current record holder on Vancouver's 90m Olympic hill is US female jumper Lindsey Van. However this hill record was set with more inrun speed and with more wind than the men competed with. These two differences are a considerable advantage in ski jumping.ScoringThe winner is decided on a scoring system based on distance and style.Each hill has a target called the calculation point (or K point) which is a par distance to aim for. It is also the place where many jumper land, in the middle of the landing area. This point is marked by the K line on the landing strip. For K90 and K120 competitions, the K line is at 90 m and 120 m respectively. Skiers are awarded 60 points if they land on the K Line. For every metre short/beyond this average, jumpers receive fewer/more points than the par 60 (1.8 points per metre).for the 2002 Winter Olympics]]In addition, five judges are based in a tower that lies to the side of the expected landing point. They can award up to 20 points for style based on: keeping the skis steady during flight, balance, good body position and landing.The final score consists of the distance score plus the middle three style scores from the judges (the highest and lowest scores are ignored). For the individual event, the jumper with the best combined total from his two jumps is the winner.TechniqueUsing the modern V-technique, pioneered by Jan Boklöv of Sweden in 1985, world-class skiers are able to exceed the distance of the take-off hill by about 10 percent compared to the previous technique with parallel skis. Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits. This follows a period when loopholes in the rules seemed to favour skinny jumpers in stiff, air foil-like suits.Previous techniques first included the Kongsberger technique, developed in Kongsberg, Norway by two ski jumpers, Jacob Tullin Thams and Sigmund Ruud following World War I. This technique had the upper body bent at the hip, a wide forward lean, and arms extended the front with the skis parallel to each other. It would lead to jumping length going from 45 meters to over 100 meters. In the 1950s Andreas Daescher of Switzerland and Erich Windisch of Germany modified the Kongsberger technique by placing his arms backward toward his hips for a closer lean. The Daescher technique and Windisch technique would be standard for ski jumping from the 1950s until the V-style technique was developed in 1985.The skiers have to touch the ground in the Telemark landing style. This involves the jumper landing with one foot in front of the other, mimicking the style of the Norwegian inventors of Telemark skiing. Otherwise the style points will be reduced.Popularity, Russia]] Ski jumping is popular among spectators and TV audiences in Scandinavia, Central Europe and Finland. Almost all world-class ski jumpers come from those regions or from Japan. Traditionally, the strongest countries (with consistently strong teams) are Finland, Norway, Germany (formerly both East and West), Austria, Poland, Slovenia and Japan. However, there have always been successful ski jumpers from other countries as well (see list below). The Four Hills Tournament, held annually at four sites in Bavaria (Germany) and Austria around New Year, is very popular and draws huge crowds.There have been attempts to spread the popularity of the sport by finding ways by which the construction and upkeep of practicing and competition venues can be made easier. These include plastic "fake snow" to provide a slippery surface even during the summer time and in locations where snow is a rare occurrence.Notable ski jumpers+Currently activeCountryFlagNameAustriaMartin HöllwarthMartin Koch]]Andreas KoflerWolfgang LoitzlThomas MorgensternGregor SchlierenzauerAndreas WidhölzlCzech RepublicJakub JandaRoman KoudelkaFinlandJanne HapponenMatti HautamäkiArttu LappiVeli-Matti LindströmHarri OlliGermanyMichael NeumayerMartin SchmittGeorg SpäthMichael UhrmannAndreas WankJapanNoriaki KasaiTakanobu OkabeNorwayLars BystølTom HildeAnders Jacobsen]]Roar LjøkelsøyBjørn Einar RomørenSigurd PettersenAnders BardalPolandStefan Hula, Jr.Adam MałyszRobert MatejaKlemens MurańkaKamil StochTomislaw TajnerSloveniaRobert KranjecJernej DamjanPrimož PeterkaRok UrbancSwitzerlandAndreas KüttelSimon AmmannRussiaDenis KornilovDimitry VassilievNotable unsuccessful ski jumpers/ Vinko Bogataj - Best known as "The Agony of Defeat" because the constant use of footage of his spectacular tumble in the title sequence of ABC's Wide World of Sports Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards - Popular favourite at the 1988 Winter OlympicsNotable female ski jumpers Anette Sagen Eva Ganster Lindsey Van Jessica Jerome Daniela IraschkoImportant venues===Ski jumping World Cup===  Engelberg, Switzerland Harrachov, Czech Republic Kranj, Slovenia Kulm, Austria Kuusamo, Finland Liberec, Czech Republic Planica, Slovenia Sapporo, Japan Trondheim (Granåsen), Norway Vikersund (Vikersundbakken), Norway Villach, Austria Willingen, Germany Zakopane, PolandFour Hills Tournament Oberstdorf, Germany Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany Innsbruck (Bergisel), Austria Bischofshofen, AustriaNordic Tournament Lahti, Finland Kuopio (Puijo), Finland Lillehammer (Lysgårdsbakkene), Norway Oslo (Holmenkollen), NorwaySki flyingSki flying is an extreme version of ski jumping. The events take place in big hills with a K-spot of at least 185 meters. There are five ski flying hills in the world today. Vikersundbakken in Vikersund, Norway; Oberstdorf, Germany; Kulm, Austria; Letalnica; Planica, Slovenia; and in Harrachov, Czech Republic. The sixth hill, Copper Peak in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, is currently disused although there are plans to rebuild it to FIS standards. http://copperpeak.org The biggest hill is in Planica, where all the longest ski jumps have taken place. It's possible to fly more than 200 meters in all the ski flying hills, and the current World Record is 239 meters, set by Norwegian Bjørn Einar Romøren in Planica 2005. The longest jump ever was 240 meters long, achieved by Janne Ahonen at the same competition, but it is not recognized as a record because Ahonen fell when he landed. Since 1972 there's been a Ski flying World Championship every other year.National recordsRankNationRecord holderLength1.Bjørn Einar Romøren239 meters2.Matti Hautamäki235.5 meters3.Gregor Schlierenzauer233.5 meters4.Robert Kranjec229 meters5.Dimitri Vassiliev228 meters6.Michael Neumayer227.5 meters7.Adam Małysz225 meters8.Daiki Ito222.5 meters9.Andreas Küttel222 meters10.Alan Alborn221.5 meters11.Antonin Hajek219 meters12.David Lazzaroni212 meters13.Roberto Cecon207.5 meters14.Isak Grimholm207.5 meters15.Petr Chaadaev]]197.5 meters16.Radik Zhaparov196.5 meters17.Martin Mesik195.5 meters18.Jens Salumäe195 meters19.Stefan Read191.5 meters20.Heung Chul Choi191 meters21.Oleksander Lasarovich178.5 meters22.Christoph Kreuzer162 meters23.Gabor Geller139 meters24.Baris Demirci123 meters25.Dmitry Chvykov122 meters26.Zhandong Tian121.5 meters27.Florin Spulber118 meters28.Petar Fartunov116.5 meters29.Glynn Pedersen113.5 meters30.Kakhaber Tsakadze105 meters31.Josip Sporer102 meters32.Andreas Bjelke Nygaard100.5 meters33.Skarphedinn Gudmundsson64 meters34.Hal Nerdal53 meters35.Kristaps Laganovski52 meters36.Dunstan Odeke50 meters37.Richard Brown35 metersWater ski jumpingThe ski jump is performed on two long skis similar to those a beginner uses, with a specialized tailfin that is somewhat shorter and much wider (so it will support the weight of the skier when he is on the jump ramp.) Skiers towed behind a boat at fixed speed, maneuver to achieve the maximum speed when hitting a ramp floating in the water, launching themselves into the air with the goal of traveling as far as possible before touching the water. Professional ski jumpers can travel up to 70 meters. The skier must successfully land and retain control of the ski rope to be awarded the distance. An extreme version of this sport named Ski Flying was promoted by Scot Ellis and Jim Cara, in which boat speeds and ramp heights are boosted because physics have proved that the standard 75ft line and traditional 35mph boat speed is outrun by the skier and the pro skier was ahead of the boat, being held back by the line.See alsoSkiing and Skiing TopicsSki jumping World CupFreestyle skiingSki jumping at the Winter OlympicsReferencesExternal linkseSkijumping.com - everything about ski jumpingskijumpingcentral.com A great English language ski jumping resourceOlympic Ski Jumping HistoryWorld's longest ski jump Bjørn Einar Romøren videoCategory:Individual sports Category:Olympic sports Category:Winter sports *bg:Ски скокове cs:Skoky na lyžích da:Skihop de:Skispringen et:Suusahüpped es:Salto en esquí eo:Skisaltado fr:Saut à ski hr:Skijaški skokovi is:Skíðastökk it:Salto con gli sci he:קפיצות סקי hu:Síugrás nl:Schansspringen ja:スキージャンプ no:Skihopping pl:Skoki narciarskie pt:Salto de esqui ro:Sărituri cu schiurile ru:Прыжки с трамплина sl:Smučarski skoki sr:Скијашки скокови sh:Skijaški skokovi fi:Mäkihyppy sv:Backhoppning vls:Schansspringn zh:跳台滑雪
