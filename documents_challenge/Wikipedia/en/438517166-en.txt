The third popular Michael Landon television vehicle (after Bonanza and Little House on the Prairie) consisted of 111 episodes produced over five seasons.The theme song for Highway to Heaven was written and performed by Ted Neeley.CancellationThe show was removed from the 1988 fall schedule and used as a mid-season replacement in 1989. This change was explained by Michael Landon on an appearance he made The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in early 1989 and is why the episodes, which were originally filmed in the fall of 1988, did not air until the late spring and into the summer of 1989 (the last episode aired on August 4, 1989). The series ending was due to it being canceled by the network and may not have been the sole consequence of Victor French's death in June 1989 from lung cancer.Filming locationsand Michael Landon.]] Filming locations included Los Angeles, Simi Valley, Stanislaus National Forest, and Tuolumne County, all in California, USA.
