The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics. 2003, Vol. 8, No. 4, 114-120. The pro-Israel media-monitoring and advocacy group CAMERA claims that Haaretz is often quoted by anti-Israel commentators. In a CAMERA conference in October 2007, executive director Andrea Levin was quoted saying in a critical speech highlighting the influence of Haaretz that "No other newspaper in Israel matters internationally because Haaretz is an elite publication and it has such an amazing English-language website. It is read by millions around the world." while The Nation describes Haaretz as "Israel's liberal beacon," citing its editorials voicing opposition to the occupation, the security fence, discriminatory treatment of Arab citizens, and the mindset that led to Second Lebanon War.ManagementThe newspaper's editorial policy was defined by Gershom Gustav Schocken, who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990.

This German publisher, based in Cologne, owns four daily newspapers and a dozen other publications. It is also a partial owner of various radio stations. The deal was negotiated with the help of former Israeli ambassador to Germany Avi Primor. According to the CEO of the Haaretz group Amos Schocken, the proceeds from the sale will allow the company to augment its stake at Walla!, an Israeli Internet site.Internet editionsHaaretz operates both Hebrew חדשות, ידיעות מהארץ והעולם - עיתון הארץ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; and English Haaretz Daily Newspaper Israel, Israeli News Source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; language websites. Some articles on both websites are open to readers' comments in the form of Internet talkback, which sometimes degenerate into mudslinging and racial slurs. Haaretz's policy on talkback is more tolerant than many other papers, in line with its belief in freedom of expression. As Fania Oz-Salzberger, a frequent contributor to the Haaretz opinion pages, put it: "It is possible and important to grapple with virtual evil, but not by silencing it. It is better to do so intelligently and with humor, in the same public space where it first saw the light of day - on the Internet itself. This is because sunshine, as American-Jewish Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis said, is the best disinfectant."The democratization of evil - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Others, among them Haaretz's Bradley Burston, feel that talkback should be censored.Ten ways to make sure that peace stays dead - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Gadi Lahav is director of content the Haaretz Group online editions, which as well as Haaretz.com and Haaretz.co.il also includes the entertainment guide Mouse.co.il.
