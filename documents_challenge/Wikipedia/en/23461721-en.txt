It is located in the North-Eastern end of the Randstad, and is the fourth largest city of the Netherlands, with a population of 288,535.&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller Utrecht agglomeration is home to some 420,000 registered inhabitants, while the larger region contains up to 820,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Utrecht's ancient city-centre features many buildings and structures from its earliest origins onwards. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the eighth century CE. Currently it is the see of the Archbishop of Utrecht, the most important Dutch Roman Catholic leader.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Utrecht is also the see of an archbishop of the [[Old Catholic]] church, and the location of the offices of the main [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands|protestant church]]. Utrecht is host to Utrecht University, the largest university of the Netherlands, as well as several other institutes for higher education. Due to its central position within the country it is an important transportation hub (rail and road) in the Netherlands. It has the second highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;HistoryOrigins ( -650)Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze age (app. 1800-800 BCE)Gemeente Utrecht, Geschiedenis Utrecht voor 1528, the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in around 50 CE. These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort a settlement would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children. A line of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand further North. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed.&lt;/ref&gt; This line was located at the borders of the main branch of the river [[Rhine]], which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today. The name of the Utrecht fortress originally was simply ''Traiectum'' denoting its location on the Rhine at a [[ford (crossing)|ford]]. Later the name was adorned with the prefix ''Ultra'' (''on the far side'') to distinguish it from other settlements (for example Mosa Trajectum [[Maastricht]]). Over time the two parts of the name would merge and evolve into the current name (Utrecht).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the second century, the wooden walls were replaced by sturdier tuff stone walls, remnants of which are still to be found below the buildings around Dom Square.From the middle of the 3rd century Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories. Around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border and Utrecht was abandoned. Little is known about the next period 270-650. Utrecht is first spoken of again in the 7th century when the influence of the growing realms of the Franks lead Dagobert I to build a church devoted to Saint Martin within the walls of the Roman fortress. In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians the church was however destroyed.Centre of Christianity in the Netherlands (650-1579), with to the left behind it the remaining section of the Dom church. The two parts have not been connected since the collapse of the nave in 1674.]] By the mid of the 7th century, English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisian. The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, archbishop of the Frisians; which is usually considered to initiation of archbishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish king bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Roman catholic church in the Netherlands. The see of the archbishops of Utrecht was located at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian empire. Furthermore it had to compete with the nearby trading centre Dorestad, also founded near the location of a Roman fortress. The political turmoil in the Frankish realms after the death of Charlemagne, in combination with viking raids and domination lead to the downfall of Dorestad and established Utrecht as one of the most important cities in the Netherlands.   The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the appointment of the Utrecht born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens to pope in 1522 (the last non Italian pope before John Paul II).Prince-BishopsWhen the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The realm of the bishopry included not only land the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht') but extended to the northeast. However, the feudalist system resulted in conflict between the different lords. The prince bishopry had its conflicts with the count of Holland and the dukes of Guelders.   The Veluwe was soon taken by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht.Clerical buildingsThe clergy built several churches and monasteries inside, or close to the city of Utrecht. Most dominant of these was the gothic Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of this cathedral started in 1254 after an earlier romanesque cathedral had been badly damaged by fire. When the choir and transept were finished from 1320 the ambitious Dom tower was built. The central nave was the last part to be constructed from 1420. By that time, however, the time of the great cathedrals had and ended and the declining finances prevented this ambitious cathedral from being finished, resulting in the construction of the central nave being suspended before finishing the planned flying buttresses. Besides the cathedral there were four additional collegiate churches in Utrecht: Saint Saviour (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt;; Saint [[John the Baptist|John]] (Janskerk), originating in 1040;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieterskerk, Utrecht|Saint Peter]], building started in 1039 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]]'s church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Besides these churches the city housed Saint Paul abbey &lt;/ref&gt;.  The 15th century [[Beguines and Beghards|beguine]] [[monastery]] of [[Saint Nicholas]], and a 14th century chapter house of the [[Teutonic Knights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Karel V&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Besides these buildings which were part of the hierarchy of the bishopric; an additional four parish churches were constructed in the city: the Jacobichurch (dedicated to Saint James), founded in the 11th century, with the current gothic church dating back to the 14th century &lt;/ref&gt;; the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]]), from the 12th century &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the 13th century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint [[Gertrude of Nivelles]]) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;City of UtrechtThe location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town Utrecht received city rights in 1122. When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed through the heart of the town became evermore canalized; and a unique wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. &lt;/ref&gt; On the wharfs storage facilities (''werfkelders'') were built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;All other canal cities in The Netherlands (such as Leiden, Amsterdam and Delft) have the water in canals bordering directly to the road surface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy.&lt;ref name=&quot;20eUtrecht&quot;/&gt; The bishop, for example [[dam]]med the [[Lek River|Lek]] at [[Wijk bij Duurstede]] to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and lead to the city of Utrecht commissioning a canal, the Vaartse Rijn, to connect Utrecht to the Lek at [[Nieuwegein]]; to insure access to the town for shipping trade.The end of independenceIn 1528 the wordly powers of the bishop over both Neder- and Oversticht; including the city of Utrecht, were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who became the Lord of the 17 Netherlands (the current Benelux and the Northern parts of France). This transition was not an easy one and Charles V wanted to exert his power of the citizens of the city; who had achieved a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to give this power to their new lord. Charles decided to build a heavily fortified castle Vredenburg to house a large garrison with as most important task to maintain order in the city. The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch revolt.Republic of the Netherlands (1579-1815)s 1652 map of Utrecht can still be recognised in the city center]] In 1579 the northern seven provinces of these Low Countries signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the one in Utrecht, which had become an archiepiscopal see in 1559. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the Holland dominated leadership of the republic. This was the start of a period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht.The city failed to defend itself against the French invasion in 1672, which was held against it in the states of the Republic. The lack of flying buttresses proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church when Utrecht was struck by a tornado in 1674. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 settled the War of the Spanish Succession. Its most lasting result was the cession by Spain of Gibraltar to Great Britain. Since 1723 (but especially after 1870) Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world.Modern history (1815-now)In the early 19th century the role of Utrecht as a fortified town became outdated. The old fortifications were outdated and the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie was moved east of Utrecht. The ramparts could now be demolished to allow for growth. The water defenses remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact until today.Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network.In 1853 the Dutch government allowed the bishopric see of Utrecht to be reinstated (by Rome), and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more.With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval center from the 1880s onward with the construction of neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).During World War II, Utrecht was held by the Germans until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May, 1945. Canadian troops that surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on May 7, 1945.Since World War II, the city has grown considerably when new neighbourhoods such as Overvecht, Kanaleneiland, Hoograven, Lunetten, and (recently) Leidsche Rijn were built. Additionally the area surrounding the central station, and the station itself have been developed following modernist ideas of the 1960's, in a brutalist style. This lead to the construction of the shopping mall Hoog Catharijne, music centre Vredenburg (Hertzberger, 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway (Catherijnebaan). Protest against further modernisation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were finalised. In the early 21st century the whole area is being redevelopedCurrently the city is expanding once more with the development of the Leidsche Rijn housing area.DemographicsInhabitants of Utrecht are called Utrechter or more rarely Utrechtenaar.The term Utrechtenaar has become a profane expression for homosexual after the 1730-31 sodomy trials, and has fallen into disuse since. This distinction, however, is not always known by Dutch speakers from outside the region, who may use the term Utrechtenaar without being aware of the specific connotation.Utrecht city has a population of 288,395 (at 1-1-2007). Utrecht is a growing municipality and projections are that the city will grow beyond 300,000 in 2008; and beyond 350,000 in 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;In Utrecht 52% of the population is female, 48% is male.

The smaller Utrecht agglomeration counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen. It is sometimes argued that the municipalities De Bilt, Zeist, Houten, Vianen, Driebergen-Rijsenburg, and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 620,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.&lt;/ref&gt;Cityscape, the 'old canal' in central Utrecht]]  Utrecht is famous for the Dom Tower of Utrecht, belonging to the former cathedral (Dom Church).RonDom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The city has a minor skyline, dominated by the Dom tower.

There is some concern about segregation in the primary schools (which is a common problem in many large cities in the Netherlands). This is caused by Dutch parents wanting to send their children to schools with a large proportion of other Dutch children, ending in a spiral where schools with a large proportion of immigrant children attract fewer and fewer Dutch children.Culture.]]Utrecht city has an active cultural life, in the Netherlands second only to Amsterdam.
