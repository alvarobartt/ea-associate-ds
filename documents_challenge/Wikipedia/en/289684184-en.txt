, Bled 2002]] The Chess Olympiad is a biennial chess tournament in which teams from all over the world compete against each other. The event is organised by FIDE, which selects the host nation.Birth of the OlympiadThe first Olympiad was unofficial. For the 1924 Olympics an attempt was made to include chess in the Olympics Games but this failed because of problems with distinguishing between amateur and professional players.  While the 1924 Summer Olympics was taking place in Paris, the 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad also took place in Paris. FIDE was formed on Sunday, July 20, 1924, the closing day of the 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad.FIDE History by Bill Wall. Retrieved 2 May 2008. FIDE organised the first Official Olympiad in 1927 which took place in London. The Olympiads were occasionally held annually and at irregular intervals until World War II; since 1950 they have been held regularly every two years.Recognised sportChess is a recognized sport by the International Olympic CommitteeRecognized Sports of the International Olympic Committee International Olympic Committee official website.

The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear. The naming of FIDE's team championship as the "Chess Olympiad" is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games.CompetitionEach FIDE recognized chess association can enter a team into the Olympiad (for the UK one team for each of the four countries plus Guernsey can enter a team separately). Each team is made of up to six players, four regular players and two reserves (changed to 4+1 in Dresden 2008 FIDE submits regulation changes for Chess Olympiad Fide.com). Initially each teams played all the teams but as the event grow over the years this became impossible. At first team seeding took place before the competition. Later certain drawbacks where recognized with seeding and in 1976 a Swiss tournament system was adopted.The trophy for winning the men's team is the Hamilton-Russell Cup, which was offered by the English magnate Frederick Hamilton-Russell as a prize for the 1st Olympiad (London 1927). The cup is kept by the winning team until the next event, when it will be consigned to the next winner. The trophy for the winning women's team is known as the Vera Menchik Cup the first Women's World Chess Champion.The 2008 Olympiad is scheduled to be held in Dresden, Germany.Chess Olympiad Dresden 2008 dresden2008.de The 2010 Olympiad is expected to be held in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia.'s score card from his round 3 game against Miguel Najdorf in the 1970 Chess Olympiad.]]  1935 by J.Steifer]] Men's OlympiadsYearEventLocationGoldSilverBronze19241st unofficial Chess Olympiad The Chess Olympiad (individual)France Paris, FranceCzechoslovakia 31Hungary 30Switzerland 2919262nd unofficial Chess Olympiad The Team Tournament  (part of FIDE summit)Hungary|1920 Budapest, HungaryHungary 9Yugoslavia 8Romania 519271st Chess OlympiadUnited Kingdom London, United KingdomHungary 40Denmark 38.5England 36.519282nd Chess OlympiadNetherlands The Hague, NetherlandsHungary 44USA 39.5Poland 3719303rd Chess OlympiadGermany|Weimar Hamburg, GermanyPoland 48.5Hungary 47Germany 44.519314th Chess OlympiadCzechoslovakia Prague, CzechoslovakiaUSA 48Poland 47Czechoslovakia 46.519335th Chess OlympiadUnited Kingdom Folkestone, United KingdomUSA 39Czechoslovakia 37.5Sweden 3419356th Chess OlympiadPoland Warsaw, PolandUSA 54Sweden 52.5Poland 5219363rd unofficial Chess Olympiad  non-FIDE unofficial Chess OlympiadGermany|Nazi Munich, GermanyHungary 110.5Poland 108Germany 106.519377th Chess OlympiadSweden Stockholm, SwedenUSA 54.5Hungary 48.5Poland 4719398th Chess OlympiadArgentina Buenos Aires, ArgentinaGermany 36Poland 35.5Estonia 33.519509th Chess OlympiadYugoslavia Dubrovnik, YugoslaviaYugoslavia 45.5Argentina 43.5W.
