It is located 4.4 km. (2.7 miles) from the center of Paris. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. After a long period of decline, the population has increased again in recent years.HistoryIts name comes from the Latin words monte mount and rubeus red, meaning Red Mountain according to the reddish color of the ground. The name was first mentioned in 1194.In 1640, the plain of Montrouge became a reserve for royal huntings.On January 1, 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, the largest part of the commune of Montrouge was annexed to Paris, and forms now the neighborhood of Petit-Montrouge, in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. The remaining part of Montrouge was preserved as a rump independent commune.In 1875, the commune gained a few thousand square metres from the neighboring communes of Châtillon and Bagneux (principally the quartier of Haut Mesnil).EconomyThe industrial development started in 1925. Many printing factories were to be found in Montrouge, but most of them have disappeared today. Today, services and telecommunications are the main activities.Aeronautical and electronic engineering, Alstom, Schlumberger, Siemens AG, ST MicroelectronicsTelecommunications, OrangeThe Papier d'Arménie (lit.

This station is located at the border between the commune of Montrouge and the commune of Châtillon, on the Châtillon side of the border.Montrouge is also served by Porte d'Orléans station on Paris Métro Line 4. This station, although administratively located on the territory of the 14th arrondissement of Paris, lies closer to the town center of Montrouge than Châtillon &ndash; Montrouge station does, and is thus used by people in Montrouge.Metro Line 4 is being extended to the south. Three new stations (Mairie de Montrouge, Verdun Sud, and Bagneux) have been planned. The first one will open by mid 2012, while no date has been set for the later two.PeopleSome notable Montrougiens:Émile Boutroux (1845–1921), philosopher and member of the Académie françaiseColuche (b. 1944 in Paris–1986) (Michel Collucci), humorist.Robert Doisneau (1912–1994), photographer, born in Gentilly, lived in Montrouge from 1937Raymond Federman (b. 1928) American novelist and academic.Jean-Jacques Goldman, author and singer, he lived most of his live and lives today in Marseille.Bernard Pivot (b. 1935).
