However, this is not correct, since other locations in Spain are farther west. Cape Finisterre is located at . Cabo da Nave is about 5 kilometers northwest of Cape Finisterre, and is located at . Punta Laxial on Cape Touriñán is about 20 kilometers north, and is even farther west, since it is located at . This part of Spain is also not the westernmost point of Continental Europe. That honour belongs to Cabo da Roca in Portugal, which is about 16.5 km farther west. The name of Cape Finisterre, like that of Finistère in France, derives from the Latin name Finisterrae, which literally means "Land's End".Monte Facho is the name of the mountain on Cape Finisterre, which has a peak that is 238 meters above sea level. A prominent lighthouse is at the top of Monte Facho. The seaside town of Fisterra is nearby.GeographyCape Finisterra has some spectacular beaches, including O Rostro, Arnela, Mar de Fora, Langosteira, Riveira, and Corbeiro. Many of the beaches are framed by steep cliffs leading down to the "Mare Tenebrosum" (or dark sea, the name of the Atlantic in the Middle Ages).There are several rocks in this area associated with religious legends, such as the "holy stones", the "stained wine stones", the "stone chair", and the tomb of the Celtic crone-goddess Orcabella.Orcabella is a Celtic goddess that takes the form of a hag and has a prodigious sexual appetite. Humans cannot hurt Orcabella; they only see her or feel her. Orcabella has many features that are similar to the Irish crone-goddess, Cailleach Bhéirre ([http://perso.wanadoo.es/garoza/G2manuelalberro.htm LA MITOLOGÍA Y EL FOLKLORE DE GALICIA Y LAS REGIONES CÉLTICAS DEL NOROESTE EUROPEO ATLÁNTICO], Manuel ALBERRO, Inst. of Cornish Studies, University of Exeter)PilgrimageCape Finisterre is the final destination for many pilgrims on the Way of St. James, the pilgrimage to the shrine of the apostle Saint James the Great in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Cape Finisterre is about a 90-km walk from Santiago de Compostela. It is a recent tradition for pilgrims to burn their clothes or boots at the end of their journey at Cape Finisterre.The origin of the pilgrimage to Finisterre is not certain. However, it is believed to date from pre-Christian times and was possibly associated with Finisterre's status as the "edge of the world". The tradition continued in medieval times, when "hospitals" were established to cater to pilgrims along the route from Santiago de Compostela to Finisterre.Some pilgrims continue on to Muxia, which is a day's walk away.

For instance, it was forbidden to ship sugar cane directly from Jamaica to Nova Scotia, as such a transaction crossed through this latitude. Instead, the laws required that the sugar cane be shipped first from Jamaica to England, where it would be re-exported to Nova Scotia.Finisterre was the former name of the current FitzRoy area on the UK Shipping Forecast. The FitzRoy area was renamed in 2002 to avoid confusion with the Spanish Finisterre peninsula.ReferencesExternal linksA 360 degree view from the Fisterra lighthousePicture Gallery of FisterraFaro de Finisterre video of Monte FachoCategory:Catholic pilgrimage sites Category:Geography of Galicia Finisterre Finisterre Category:Way of St. Jamesde:Kap Finisterre es:Cabo Finisterre eu:Fisterra lurmuturra fr:Cap Finisterre gl:Cabo Fisterra la:Finis Terrae (promontorium Hispanicum) nl:Cabo Finisterre ja:フィニステレ岬 no:Kapp Finisterre pl:Przylądek Finisterre sv:Kap Finisterre
