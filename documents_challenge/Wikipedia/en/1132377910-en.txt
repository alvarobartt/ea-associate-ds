The Commonwealth Games is a multinational, multi-sport event. Held every four years, it involves the elite athletes of the Commonwealth of Nations. Attendance at the Commonwealth Games is typically around 5,000 athletes. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the organisation that is responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games.The first such event, then known as the British Empire Games, was held in 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The name changed to British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954, to British Commonwealth Games in 1970 and assumed the current name of the Commonwealth Games in 1974.As well as many Olympic sports, the Games also include some sports that are played mainly in Commonwealth countries, such as lawn bowls, rugby sevens and netball.There are currently 53 members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and 71 teams participate in the Games. The four constituent countries of the United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - send separate teams to the Commonwealth Games (unlike at the Olympic Games, where the United Kingdom sends a single team), and individual teams are also sent from the British Crown dependencies - Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man - and many of the British overseas territories. The Australian external territory of Norfolk Island also sends its own team, as do the Cook Islands and Niue, two non-sovereign states in free association with New Zealand.Only six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales. Australia has been the highest scoring team for ten games, England for seven and Canada for one.At the 1930 games, women competed in Swimming and Diving only. In 1934 women competed in some Athletics events also.OriginsA sporting competition bringing together the members of the British Empire was first proposed by the Reverend Astley Cooper in 1891 when he wrote an article in The Times suggesting a "Pan-Britannic-Pan-Anglican Contest and Festival every four years as a means of increasing the goodwill and good understanding of the British Empire".In 1911, the Festival of the Empire was held in London to celebrate the coronation of King George V. As part of the festival an Inter-Empire Championships was held in which teams from Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom competed in events such as boxing, wrestling, swimming and athletics.In 1928, Melville Marks (Bobby) Robinson of Canada was asked to organise the first British Empire Games. These were held in Hamilton, Ontario two years later.Opening ceremony traditionsFrom 1930 through 1950, the parade of nations was led by a single flagbearer carrying the Union Flag, symbolising Britain's leading role in the British Empire.Since 1958, there has been a relay of athletes carrying a baton from Buckingham Palace to the Opening Ceremony. This baton has within it the Queen's Message of Greeting to the athletes. The baton's final bearer is usually a famous sporting personage of the host nation.All other nations march in English alphabetical order, except that the first nation marching in the Parade of Athletes is the host nation of the previous games, and the host nation of the current games marches last. In 2006 countries marched in alphabetical order in geographical regions.Three national flags fly from the stadium on the poles that are used for medal ceremonies: Previous host nation, Current host nation, Next host nation.The military is more active in the Opening Ceremony than in the Olympic Games. This is to honour the British Military traditions of the Old Empire.BoycottsThe Commonwealth Games, like the Olympic Games, has also suffered from political boycotts. Nigeria boycotted the 1978 Games in protest of New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, and 32 of 59 nations from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean boycotted the 1986 Commonwealth Games due to the Thatcher government's attitude towards South African sporting contacts. Boycotts were also threatened in 1974, 1982, and 1990 because of South Africa.All time medal table16435565081707 1257955356316953374402412118841241682385255104907226669292962807829415332985947561629477196214104030351051137485714212 / Malaya3648511351321171654141723387815 / Ceylon16191954161517187501713918401810121739199611262095721219562022813173823899262466921255271426 / 361221273514222834512293271230 / 25613312428322349332147342114352103361438371247381225391113401034411012421001430347440325450257460235470134470134490123500101510033520022530011530011530011530011530011Note 1: Total here lower than total on country page Australia at the Commonwealth Games.EditionsBritish Empire Games 1930 British Empire Games - Hamilton, Ontario, Canada 1934 British Empire Games - London, England, United Kingdom 1938 British Empire Games - Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 1950 British Empire Games - Auckland, New ZealandBritish Empire and Commonwealth Games 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games - Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games - Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games - Perth, Western Australia, Australia 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games - Kingston, JamaicaBritish Commonwealth Games 1970 British Commonwealth Games - Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom 1974 British Commonwealth Games - Christchurch, New ZealandCommonwealth Games 1978 Commonwealth Games - Edmonton, Alberta, Canada 1982 Commonwealth Games - Brisbane, Queensland, Australia 1986 Commonwealth Games - Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom 1990 Commonwealth Games - Auckland, New Zealand 1994 Commonwealth Games - Victoria, British Columbia, Canada 1998 Commonwealth Games - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 2002 Commonwealth Games - Manchester, England, United Kingdom 2006 Commonwealth Games - Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 2010 Commonwealth Games - Delhi, India 2014 Commonwealth Games - Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom2018 Commonwealth Games - TBDNumbers of athletes, sports, and nationsThis list shows the total number of athletes, male and female, the number of sports they were selected to compete in, and the number of nations (including dependencies) competing.YearAthletesMaleFemaleSportsEventsOfficialsNations20064500162247712002386317372199836381570199426691263199020731020555198616601016527198215801214345197814751112647197412769772991012137238197017441101214219661316110110341962863917835195811229228351954662912724195059049595912193846474315193450061719304006111Total including athletes and officials. 2Includes 4 team sports. 3Includes 3 team sports.List of nations/dependencies to competeNations/dependencies that have competedNotes:1: Aden became South Arabia which left the Commonwealth in 1968. 2: Became Guyana in 1966. 3: Became Belize in 1973. 4: Became Sri Lanka in 1972. 5: Became Ghana in 1957. 6: Left the Commonwealth when handed over to China in 1997. 7: Ireland was represented as the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in 1934.

The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus have made applications to the CGF to send teams. The Pitcairn Islands' tiny population (50 as of July 2007) would appear to prevent the overseas territory from competing.Other states and territories with native populations within the Commonwealth that may be eligible include  and the .It is also conceivable that any future members of the Commonwealth such as applicants  and  may participate in future games.Sports of the Commonwealth GamesThe current regulations state that a minimum of ten and no more than fifteen sports must be included in a Commonwealth Games schedule. There is a list of core sports, which must be included, and a further list of approved sports from which the host nation may choose to include. The host nation may also apply for the inclusion of other team sports to the CGF General Assembly, as the Melbourne organising committee did with basketball for the 2006 Games.The current core sports consist of athletics, aquatics (swimming, diving and synchronised swimming), lawn bowls, netball (for women) and rugby sevens (for men). These will all remain core sports until at least the 2014 Commonwealth Games.The approved list of sports also includes archery, badminton, billiards and snooker, boxing, canoeing, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, judo, rowing, sailing, shooting, squash, table tennis, tennis, ten-pin bowling, triathlon, weightlifting, and wrestling. Some of these are often included in the programme, while others, like billiards and sailing, have not yet been included.In 2002, the CGF introduced the David Dixon Award for the outstanding athlete of the Games.There is also a requirement to include some events for Elite Athletes with a Disability (EAD). This was introduced in the 2002 Games.On 18th November 2006, tennis and archery were added to the list of disciplines for the 2010 Games in New Delhi, bringing the total number of sports to 17.
