He recorded one album with them, The Fury of the Aquabats!, in 1997. His career took off when he joined up with pop punk band, Blink-182 in 1998.

His marriage and personal life have been considerable media fodder following his divorce in 2006 and a brief relationship with Hilton Hotel heiress Paris Hilton.Early lifeBarker was born in a poverty-stricken neighborhood in Fontana, California. He received his first drum set at the age of four. He began taking drum and trumpet lessons at the age of five. The day before Barker started his freshman year at Fontana High School, his mother died. She told him before she died to continue playing the drums because that was what he was good at, and he listened to her. After her death, Barker became more serious about drumming. He joined a marching band in his sophomore year and made the snare line. During high school he performed at regional competitions and festivals. During his senior year of high school, Barker passed up drum corps tryouts to tour with his first band, Feeble.After graduating from high school in 1993, Barker gained more experience as a rock drummer in a few early bands including Feeble and The Aquabats. In the latter, he was known as Baron Von Tito.YearAlbum/Song TitlePerformer(s)Record Label/Notes1997The Fury of the Aquabats!The AquabatsGolden Voice Records1999Enema of the StateBlink-182MCA Records2000The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show: The Enema Strikes BackBlink-182MCA Records2001Take Off Your Pants and JacketBlink-182MCA Records2002Box Car Racer]]''Box Car RacerMCA RecordsTransplants]]''Transplants]]Hellcat Records2003Blink-182]]''Blink-182Geffen RecordsTry ThisPink]]Geffen Records2004"Back in the Mudd"Bubba SparxxxRemix on Cd single2005Greatest Hits]]''Blink-182Geffen RecordsHaunted CitiesTransplants]]La Salle Records/Atlantic RecordsTrillBun BAppears along with Skinhead Rob on "Late Night Creepin"2006King]]''T.I.Produced "You Know Who""Can I Have It like That"PharrellRemix included on the UK CD"Throw Some D's"Rich BoyRemix available on iTunesPump ItBlack Eyed PeasRemix included on CD singleWhen Your Heart Stops Beating+44]]Interscope]]2007Dj Skee Presents Expensive TasteExpensive TasteWolves]]''Idiot PilotDrums on "Elephant"The Best Damn ThingAvril LavigneDrums on "I Don't Have To Try" and "I Can Do Better"Get Money, Stay TruePaul WallAppears as Expensive Taste on the track "Slidin' on that Oil"Umbrella]]"RihannaRemix of "Umbrella" available on Defjam.com"Doe Boy Fresh"Three 6 Mafia"Crank That (Soulja Boy)"Soulja BoyRemix of "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" available on iTunes"The Way It Is"BLESTeNATION]]"Black Roses"the Federation]]Drums on the track from It's Whateva2008Low]]"Flo RidaRemix of "Low" available on deluxe edition of Mail on Sunday (iTunes)"Don't Touch Me (Throw Da Water On 'Em)"Busta RhymesRemix of "Don't Touch Me""Dope Boys"The GameDrums on beat & contributed vocals on hook"G Told Me"Wale]]InterscopeFix Your FaceTRVS DJAMMixtape available on http://www.trvsdjam.com"Got Money"Lil WayneRemix of "Got Money"Business venturesBarker owns and contributes to several businesses in addition to his musical interests. He founded an accessory/apparel company called Famous Stars and Straps in 1999 which sells street/skate style clothing and gear. Barker has said the brand's trademark "F" for the logo was chosen for its resemblance to a car logo but mainly for the fact that it can stand on its own.He also co-founded LaSalle Records, a record company to which his band, Transplants, are signed. He has also dabbled in the restaurant industry, opening a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California.Barker has also developed a shoe for DC Shoe Company called the "Alias Remix" and is endorsed by Orange County Drum and Percussion and Zildjian. He also has his own line of drumming products, sponsored by Zildjian.In 2006, Barker began the process of filing for the trademark "The Phenomenons". The trademark application indicates the name will be used for a band and possibly a clothing line but that remains to be seen.TattoosBarker's first tattoo was the word "BONES" (a nickname when he was a kid) on his leg which he got when he was 17 years old. Another addition is the phrase "SELF MADE" spelled out across his knuckles which he got in 2000. Some of his numerous tattoos include religious art as he says he was brought up Catholic. He has a portrait of Jesus above his left biceps, hands in prayer on the left side of his head (visible with his signature mohawk) and a Sacred Heart. Barker has a few tattoos that symbolize his love for cars and Cadillacs in particular - two racing flags on the side of his neck with the number 66 which symbolizes the year of his favorite Cadillac and a Cadillac emblem surrounded by mudflap girls on his chest as well as a pair of spark plugs. Another well known Cadillac tattoo is the word "Cadillac" on the side of his body.Much of his body art is devoted to his love of music such as the phrase "Can I Say" (which is the name of Dag Nasty's first album), a microphone, and a boom box on his stomach for his love of breakdancing when he was growing up. Barker also has the word "HOPE" on his back because of the Descendents' song and something positive after his mother's death. He has another tribute to the Descendents on his leg - the cover art to the album, I Don't Want to Grow Up, drumsticks and musical notes on his right arm.Barker also makes several tributes to his family with the phrase "familia" on his arm, Japanese flowers on the back of his neck with a heart that says "Mom", and another heart with "SHANNA" on the banner. He also has the name of his first wife, "Melissa," just above the racing flags on the side of his neck. Barker has his son's name Landon on his left wrist.He considers his right arm his good luck arm and so has many luck emblems tattooed on that arm such as a deck of cards, dice, a dollar sign, his lucky number seven, a skull with the number 13 in the eye sockets (13 is a lucky number in the tattoo culture), and a rabbit's foot, in addition to a martini glass, his initials, a devil from Black Label Skateboards, and a spider web surrounding his elbow.Barker has a tattoo-quote by Henry Brooks Adams stating "Chaos Often Breeds Life, When Order Breeds Habit"; the quote is tattooed around Barker's neck, and can also be found on the spine of the Box Car Racer CD case.In explanation of his large number of tattoos Barker has said, "I tattooed my body so I couldn't fall back on anything. I purposely did that so I couldn't get a normal job and live a normal life. I did it so I had to play music." He claims to have spent over $30,000 on his body art.RelationshipsBarker has been married twice. He first married his relatively long time girlfriend, Melissa Kennedy, on September 22, 2001. The couple divorced August 6, 2002 after eleven months of marriage.Barker married actress and Miss USA 1995, Shanna Moakler, on October 30, 2004. The couple had a Gothic-style ceremony inspired by the Tim Burton film, The Nightmare Before Christmas, which was held on the eve of Halloween. Barker and Moakler have two children together, Landon Asher and Alabama Luella. Atiana Cecilia de la Hoya is Moakler's daughter with former boyfriend Oscar de la Hoya. The family appeared in a reality television series, Meet the Barkers, which aired on MTV from 2005-2006.On August 8, 2006, Barker filed for divorce from Moakler after nearly two years of marriage. The couple's divorce was made public as each used their MySpace pages to air their feelings on the matter. During their separation, Barker had a brief fling with Hilton Hotel heiress and socialite, Paris Hilton in September, 2006.Despite their pending divorce, reports surfaced in early 2007 that Barker and Moakler were "quietly trying to give it another go" as they were reportedly seen autographing a fan's book, with a heart around their names.In March 2007, Moakler revealed to People magazine that she and Barker (still married) are indeed back together, but denied that she was pregnant. This admission came after the couple was publicly affectionate at a surprise birthday Barker threw for his wife in Miami. People.com later reported that the couple had separated again. No reason was given for the split. Barker and Moakler were seen together at the 2007 Video Music Awards kissing and holding hands. However, as of February 11, 2008, the couple's divorce had been finalized.==Film and television== Travis has appeared in numerous films and television shows, most notably his own reality show, Meet the Barkers, with his wife Shanna Moakler which debuted in 2005.
