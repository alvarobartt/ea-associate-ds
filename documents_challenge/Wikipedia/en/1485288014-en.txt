  Stromatolites from Bolivia, South America]] The Proterozoic () is a geological eon representing a period before the first abundant complex life on Earth. The Proterozoic Eon extended from 2500 Ma to 542.0 ± 1.0 Ma (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the old, informally named ‘Precambrian’ time.The Proterozoic consists of 3 geologic eras, from oldest to youngest:PaleoproterozoicMesoproterozoicNeoproterozoicThe well-identified events were:The transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Mesoproterozoic.Several glaciations, including the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian period in the late Neoproterozoic.The Ediacaran Period (635 to 542 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms.The Proterozoic recordThe geologic record of the Proterozoic is much better than that for the preceding Archean. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered. Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid continental accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and wholly-modern orogenic activity.Stanley, 315-18, 329-32The first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the Snowball Earth of the Varangian glaciation.Stanley, 320-1, 325The build-up of oxygenOne of the most important events of the Proterozoic was the gathering up of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. Though oxygen was undoubtedly released by photosynthesis well back in Archean times, it could not build up to any significant degree until chemical sinks — unoxidized sulfur and iron — had been filled; until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level.Stanley, 323 Banded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were also a prominent chemical sink; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, either due to an increase in oxygen or a more thorough mixing of the oceanic water column.Stanley, 324Red beds, which are colored by hematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks. The oxygen build-up was probably due to two factors: a filling of the chemical sinks, and an increase in carbon burial, which sequestered organic compounds that would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmosphere.Stanley, 325PaleogeographyThe Mackenzie dike swarm in Canada's Canadian Shield is the largest known dike swarm on Earth, and was a source for significant massive flood basalt eruptions throughout the Proterozoic period. The source for the Mackenzie dike swarm is thought to have been a mantle plume center called the Mackenzie hotspot.Lunar and Planetary Science XXVIII Proterozoic lifeThe first advanced single-celled and multi-cellular life roughly coincides with the start of the accumulation of free oxygen; this may have been due to an increase in the oxidized nitrates that eukaryotes use, as opposed to cyanobacteria. It was also during the Proterozoic that the first symbiotic relationships between mitochondria (for nearly all eukaryotes) and chloroplasts (for plants and some protists only) and their hosts evolved.Stanley 321-2The blossoming of eukaryotes such as acritarchs did not preclude the expansion of cyanobacteria; in fact, stromatolites reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic, peaking roughly 1.2 billion years ago.Stanley, 321-3Classically, the boundary between the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic eons was set at the base of the Cambrian period when the first fossils of animals known as trilobites and archeocyathids appeared. In the second half of the 20th century, a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks, but the upper boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian, which is currently placed at 542 Ma.See alsoTimetable of the PrecambrianReferencesExternal linksProterozoic - Palaeos Category:Geological history of Earth Category:Proterozoicbr:Proterozoeg ca:Proterozoic cs:Proterozoikum da:Proterozoikum de:Proterozoikum et:Proterosoikum el:Προτεροζωικός αιώνας es:Eón Proterozoico eo:Proterozoiko fr:Protérozoïque gl:Proterozoico ko:원생누대 id:Proterozoikum it:Proterozoico he:פרוטרוזואיקון kk:Протерозой la:Aeon Proterozoicus lt:Proterozojus hu:Proterozoikum nl:Proterozoïcum ja:原生代 no:Proterozoikum nds:Proterozoikum pl:Proterozoik pt:Proterozóico ru:Протерозой sk:Proterozoikum sl:Proterozoik sh:Proterozoik fi:Proterotsooinen eoni sv:Proterozoikum vi:Liên đại Nguyên Sinh tr:Proterozoik Devir uk:Альгонкська ера zh:元古宙
