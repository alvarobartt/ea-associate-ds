The Vltava (; ) is the longest river in the Czech Republic, running north from its source in Šumava through Český Krumlov, České Budějovice, and Prague (Praha), merging with the Elbe (Labe) at Mělník. It is 430&nbsp;km long and drains about 28,090&nbsp;km2; at their confluence the Vltava actually has more water than the Elbe, but joins the Elbe at a right angle to its flow so that it appears a mere tributary. Several dams were built on it in the 1950s, the biggest being Lipno Dam in Šumava.In August 2002 a flood of the Vltava killed several people and caused massive damage and disruption along its length.The best-known of the classical Czech composer Bedřich Smetana's set of six symphonic poems Má vlast ("My Fatherland") is called Vltava (or The Moldau), and is a musical depiction of the river's course through Bohemia.Physical Descriptionpanorama upstream from the Charles Bridge]]  The height difference from source to mouth is 1016&nbsp;m and the largest stream at the source is named Černý Potok (Black Brook).EtymologyBoth the Czech name Vltava and the German name Moldau are believed to originate from the old Germanic words *wilt ahwa ("wild water") (cf. Latin aqua).HonorsA minor planet 2123 Vltava discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after the river.ReferencesCategory:Rivers of Central Bohemian Region Category:Rivers of South Bohemian Region Category:Prague ar:فلتافا be-x-old:Влтава ca:Vltava cs:Vltava cy:Afon Vltava da:Moldau de:Moldau (Fluss) et:Vltava el:Μολδάβας es:Moldava eo:Vultavo fa:مولداو fr:Vltava ko:블타바 강 hr:Vltava id:Sungai Vltava it:Moldava (fiume) he:ולטאבה la:Multavia lt:Vltava hu:Moldva (folyó) nl:Moldau ja:ヴルタヴァ川 no:Moldau nn:Moldau pl:Wełtawa pt:Rio Moldava ro:Vltava ru:Влтава sq:Moldau (lum) simple:Vltava sk:Vltava sr:Влтава fi:Vltava sv:Vltava uk:Влтава zh:伏尔塔瓦河
