He is known for playing the lead role in the 2003 film version of Peter Pan. Sumpter and his family live in Los Angeles.BiographyEarly lifeJeremy Sumpter was born in Monterey, California, the son of Sandra (née Johnson) and Gary Sumpter. His siblings, twin sister, Jessica, and younger sister, Gigi, are also actresses. He was raised in the small town of Mount Sterling, Kentucky, until he was eleven. He won IMTA's Pre-Teen Male Model of the Year award in 2000. Soon afterward, he signed with Mark Robert Management and his family moved to Los Angeles, where he currently resides.CareerIn July 2002, Sumpter, then thirteen years old, was selected for the role of Peter Pan, breaking the long-standing tradition of young women playing the part in stage and live-action film adaptations of the story. During filming (fall of 2002), he grew several inches, requiring some filming and staging tricks to conceal his height in scenes filmed late in production. Sumpter did nearly all of his stunts for the film himself. To prepare, he says he practiced sword fighting as much as five hours a day, as well as training in gymnastics and lifting weights. While filming in Australia, he supplemented his training with cricket and surfing. The $140 million-budgeted film opened in December 2003, but did poorly, possibly due to reports of its more "adult" treatment of the J. M. Barrie story and competition at the box office from the highly-anticipated The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Sumpter spent the summer of 2005 in Oregon filming the comedy The Sasquatch Dumpling Gang, which was theatrically released in November, 2007. He also appears in the independent film An American Crime, where he portrays Coy Hubbard. He also appeared in an episode of CSI Miami as the boyfriend of a girl whose parents are murdered. He has completed filming Calvin Marshall in which he plays the part of Caselli. He is also attached to appear in Prep School and Word of Mouth.Personal lifeSumpter enjoys surfing, as well as basketball, football, baseball, snowboarding, tennis, soccer, hiking, swimming, rollerblading, golf, and watching storm clouds. His favorite movie is "King Kong", he also likes "Unforgiven" and "Twister". He has been cast in numerous athletic roles, including Local Boys (surfing), Peter Pan (sword fighting), Clubhouse (baseball), Cyber Seduction (swimming). In October 2005, Sumpter competed in his first celebrity golf tournament: the Eddie Money Golf Tournament in Northern California. His team placed 3rd out of 24 teams.FilmographyYearTitleRoleNotes2008]]Word of Mouth]]''Rex (pre-production)2008]]Prep School]]''Simon (pre-production)2008]]Calvin MarshallCaselli2007]]An American CrimeCoy Hubbard2007]]CSI: MiamiZach Griffith (in Broken Home)2006]]The Sasquatch Dumpling GangGavin Gore2005]]Cyber Seduction: His Secret LifeJustin Petersen2004]]Clubhouse (TV series)Pete Young2003]]Peter Pan]]''Peter Pan2002]]Local Boys]]''Skeeter Dobson2002]]FrailtyYoung Adam2001]]Just A Dream]]''Henry SturbuckAwardsSaturn Award (winner) 2004 Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Peter Pan.Young Artist Award (winner) 2004 Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Peter Pan.Saturn Award (nomination) 2003 Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Frailty.Young Artist Award (winner) 2002 Best Performance in a TV Movie, Mini-Series or Special - Leading Young Actor for Just A Dream.External linksOfficial Site[http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_844118.html Peter Pan grows up! - Ananova - 4 December 2003]Jeremy Sumpter Is To Star As Peter Pan (July 16, 2002) Category:1989 births Category:American child actors Category:American film actors Category:American television actors Category:Living people Category:People from Monterey County, Californiade:Jeremy Sumpter et:Jeremy Sumpter es:Jeremy Sumpter fr:Jeremy Sumpter it:Jeremy Sumpter ms:Jeremy Sumpter nl:Jeremy Sumpter ja:ジェレミー・サンプター no:Jeremy Sumpter pl:Jeremy Sumpter pt:Jeremy Sumpter sq:Jeremy Sumpter fi:Jeremy Sumpter sv:Jeremy Sumpter tr:Jeremy Sumpter
