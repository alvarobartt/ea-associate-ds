The original Bugatti brand failed with the coming of World War 2, like many high-end marques of the time. The death of Ettore's son Jean was also a contributory factor. The company struggled financially into the 1960s eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business. Today the name is owned by Volkswagen AG who have revived it as a builder of very limited production sports cars.Under Ettore Bugatti, painted in the blue racing colour of France.]]Founder Ettore Bugatti was born in Milan, Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was founded in Molsheim a town in the Alsace region of France. The company was known for both the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, as well for the artistic way in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), was an important Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry designer). The company also enjoyed great success in early Grand Prix motor racing, winning the first ever Monaco Grand Prix. The company's success culminated with driver Jean-Pierre Wimille winning the 24 hours of Le Mans twice (in 1937 with Robert Benoist and 1939 with Pierre Veyron).DesignBugatti's doors were as much works of art as they were mechanical creations. Engine blocks were hand scraped to ensure that the surfaces were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, to engine turned finishes on many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment, and safety wires threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the axles as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed though a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He regarded his arch competitor Bentley's cars as "the world's fastest trucks" for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, weight was the enemy. Bugatti’s inspiring creations attracted many people from other fields of interest, like Arlen Ness who created a motorcycle, called “Smooth-Ness”, with the Bugatti style. He was inspired by the smoothness of a bronze casting of a Bugatti automobile.ModelsOnly a few examples of each of Ettore Bugatti's vehicles were ever produced, the most famous being the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the "Royale", the Type 57 &quot;Atlantic&quot; and the Type 55 sports car.Throughout the production run of approximately 7,900 cars (of which about 2,000 still exist), each Bugatti model was designated with the prefix T for Type, which referred to the chassis and drive train.

After World War II, a 375&nbsp;cc supercharged car was canceled when Ettore died.Racing successBugatti cars were extremely successful in racing, with many thousands of victories in just a few decades. The little Bugatti Type 10 swept the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 Bugatti Type 35 is probably the most successful racing car of all time with over 2,000 wins. Bugattis swept to victory in the Targa Florio for five years straight from 1925 through 1929. Louis Chiron held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the 21st century Bugatti company remembered him with a concept car named in his honour. But it was the final racing success at Le Mans that is most remembered—Jean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron won the 1939 race with just one car and meagre resources.YearRaceDriverCar1921Voiturettes Grand PrixErnest Friderich1925Targa FlorioBartolomeo CostantiniType 35]]1926French Grand PrixJules GouxType 39 A1926Italian Grand PrixLouis Charavel1926Spanish Grand PrixBartolomeo Costantini1926Targa FlorioBartolomeo CostantiniType 35 T]]1927Targa FlorioEmilio MaterassiType 35 C]]1928French Grand PrixWilliam Grover-WilliamsType 35 C]]1928Italian Grand PrixLouis Chiron1928Spanish Grand PrixLouis Chiron1928Targa FlorioAlbert DivoType 35 B]]1929French Grand PrixWilliam Grover-WilliamsType 35 B]]1929German Grand PrixLouis Chiron1929Spanish Grand PrixLouis Chiron1929Monaco Grand PrixWilliam Grover-Williams1929Targa FlorioAlbert DivoType 35 C]]1930Belgian Grand PrixLouis Chiron1930Czechoslovakian Grand PrixHeinrich-Joachim von Morgen and Hermann zu Leiningen1930French Grand PrixPhilippe EtancelinType 35 C]]1930Monaco Grand PrixRené Dreyfus1931Belgian Grand PrixWilliam Grover-Williams and Caberto Conelli1931Czechoslovakian Grand PrixLouis Chiron1931French Grand PrixLouis Chiron and Achille VarziType 511931Monaco Grand PrixLouis Chiron1932Czechoslovakian Grand PrixLouis Chiron1933Czechoslovakian Grand PrixLouis Chiron1933Monaco Grand PrixAchille Varzi1934Belgian Grand PrixRené Dreyfus1936French Grand PrixJean-Pierre Wimille and Raymond SommerType 57 G]]193724 hours of Le MansJean-Pierre Wimille and Robert BenoistType 57 G]]193924 hours of Le MansJean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre VeyronType 57 C]]Bugatti in Formula One(key)YearChassisEngine(s)TyresDrivers12345678PointsWCCBugatti 251Bugatti Straight-8ARGMON500BELFRAGBRGERITA0*'-*'Maurice TrintignantRet* The World Constructors' Championship was not awarded before 1958.The endEttore Bugatti also designed a successful motorised railcar, the Autorail, and an airplane, which never flew. His son, Jean Bugatti, was killed on August 11, 1939 at the age of 30, while testing a Type 57 tank-bodied race car near the Molsheim factory. Subsequently the company's fortunes began to decline. World War II ruined the factory in Molsheim, and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois in Paris and designed a series of new cars. Ettore Bugatti died on August 21, 1947.The company attempted a comeback under Roland Bugatti in the mid-1950s with the mid-engined Type 251 race car. Designed with help from famed Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Maserati designer Gioacchino Colombo, the car failed to perform to expectations and the company's attempts at automobile production were halted.In the 1960s, Virgil Exner designed a Bugatti as part of his "Revival Cars" project. A show version of this car was actually built by Ghia using the last Bugatti Type 101 chassis and was shown at the 1965 Turin Motor Show. Finance was not forthcoming and Exner then turned his attention to a revival of Stutz.Bugatti continued producing airplane parts and was sold to Hispano-Suiza (another auto maker turned aircraft supplier) in 1963. Snecma took over in 1968, later acquiring Messier. The two were merged into Messier-Bugatti in 1977.Bugatti Automobili SpA(1996).]]Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli acquired the famous Bugatti name in 1987 and established Bugatti Automobili SpA. The new company built a factory designed by the architect Giampaolo Benedini in Campogalliano, Italy, a town near Modena, home to other performance-car manufacturers De Tomaso, Ferrari, Pagani and Maserati.By 1989, the plans for the new Bugatti-revival were presented by Paolo Stanzani and Marcello Gandini, famous designers of the Lamborghini Miura and Countach. The first completed car was labelled the Bugatti EB110 GT, advertised as the most technically advanced sports car ever produced.From 1992 through 1994, famed racing car designer, Mauro Forghieri, was technical director.On August 27, 1993, through his holding company, ACBN Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, Romano Artioli purchased the Lotus car company from General Motors. The acquisition brought together two of the greatest historical names in automotive racing and plans were made for listing the company's shares on international stock exchanges. Bugatti also presented in 1993 the prototype of a large sedan called the EB 112.By the time the EB110 came to market the North American and European economies were in recession and operations ceased in September 1995. A model specific to the United States market called the "Bugatti America" was in the preparatory stages when the company closed. Bugatti's liquidators sold Lotus to Proton of Malaysia.In 1997, German manufacturer Dauer Racing bought the EB110 license and remaining parts stock to Bugatti in order to produce five more EB110 SS units, although they were greatly refined by Dauer. The factory was later sold to a furniture making company, which also collapsed before they were able to move in. The factory still remains unoccupied to this day.Perhaps the most famous Bugatti EB110 owner is racing driver Michael Schumacher, 7 times Formula One world champion. Despite later racing for Ferrari, he still retained the EB110 he acquired while racing for the Benetton team. In 2003 Schumacher sold the car -repaired after a severe crash in 1994, the same year of purchase- to Modena Motorsport, a Ferrari service and race preparation garage in Germany.Bugatti Automobiles SAS.]]See also the main article, Bugatti Automobiles SASVolkswagen AG purchased the rights to produce cars under the Bugatti marque in 1998. They commissioned ItalDesign to produce the Bugatti EB118 concept, a touring sedan which featured a 555&nbsp;hp DIN (408&nbsp;kW) output and the first W-configuration 18-cylinder engine in any passenger vehicle, at the Paris Auto Show.In 1999 the Bugatti EB 218 concept was introduced at the Geneva Auto Show; later that year the Bugatti 18/3 Chiron was introduced at the IAA in Frankfurt. At the Tokyo Motor Show the EB 218 reappeared and the Bugatti EB 16.4 Veyron was presented as the first incarnation of what was to be a production road car.The Veyron 16.4In 2000 Volkswagen AG founded Bugatti Automobiles SAS and introduced the EB 16/4 Veyron concept, a 16-cylinder quadruple turbo charged car with 1001&nbsp;hp DIN (736&nbsp;kW), 0-100 km/h ( 0-62 mph) in 2.5 sec. and goes  , at the Paris, Geneva and Detroit auto shows, the cost of which to create is estimated at around £6m per car. Development continued throughout 2004 and the EB 16/4 Veyron was promoted to "advanced concept" status. In July 2005 Bugatti Automobiles SAS announced that the car would officially be called the Bugatti Veyron 16.4. It was said that the car—built in a brand new Bugatti factory in Dorlisheim—would be delivered to clients in October 2005. In fact the Veyron finally entered production in late 2005, the first cars being delivered in early 2006. Minimum speed claims have been met in several high speed tests where the car slightly exceeded its target, reaching [http://www.bugatti.com/en/veyron-16.4/technology/speed.html bugatti.com: 400 and beyond]. According to Car and Driver, the Veyron's fuel consumption at 253 mph was 3.0 mpg (78L/100km). At full throttle, its 100 L (26 US gal/22 imp gal) fuel tank would empty in just 12 minutes 46 seconds. This is a safety measure studied by the engineers because after 15 straight minutes at 253 mph the tires would melt.Independent press tests have reported many failures (three out of five cars notionally available for testing in November 2005 were out of service), but the Veyron prototypes were put through the same grueling regimen as other Volkswagen group models, with each pre-production car logging over 50,000 miles. This car comes in many different color combinations, including red and black, blue and dark blue, grey and black, and so on.Bugatti Veyron Fbg par Hermès is the latest limited edition version of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4. It is a limited edition model that costs $2.3 million (not including tax)and has an interior designed and crafted by the French leather and silk specialist, Hermès. The Fbg in the limited edition Veyron's name stands for, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré; the address of the headquarters for Hermès. The Bugatti Veyron Fbg par Hermès has no mechanical alterations and is still essentially the Bugatti Veyron 16.4; the only alterations are that of the interior-balls calfskin composes the new interior.See alsoMusée National de l'Automobile de Mulhouse, home of the Schlumpf Collection of Bugatti carsReferencesExternal linksBugatti Automobiles S.A.S.Bugatti bibliography   Category:Bugatti Category:Car manufacturers Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of France Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of Germany Category:Sports car manufacturers Category:Formula One constructors Category:Formula One entrants Category:Grand Prix teams Category:Volkswagen Category:French auto racing teams Category:French racecar constructors Category:Aircraft engine manufacturers of France Category:Companies established in 1909bar:Bugatti bs:Bugatti ca:Bugatti da:Bugatti de:Bugatti es:Bugatti fr:Bugatti hr:Bugatti id:Bugatti it:Bugatti he:בוגאטי hu:Bugatti nah:Bugatti nl:Bugatti ja:ブガッティ no:Bugatti pl:Bugatti pt:Bugatti ru:Bugatti sk:Bugatti (1909-1963) sl:Bugatti fi:Bugatti sv:Bugatti tr:Bugatti zh:布佳迪
