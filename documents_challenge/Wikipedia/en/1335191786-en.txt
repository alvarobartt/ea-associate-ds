He participated in 99 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on March 26, 1995. He scored a total of 10 championship points.BiographyDiniz's motor racing career progressed as a result of his father, Abílio dos Santos Diniz, owning the Brazilian distribution company Companhia Brasileira de Distribuiçao and the supermarket chain Pao de Acucar. He joined the Forti F1 team due to these connections leading to a marketing-deal with Parmalat, backing he took throughout his career. At the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix his car burst into flames after a pit-stop; British newspaper The Sun printed the photo alongside the headline "Diniz in the Oven".at the 1995 British Grand Prix.]]  at the 1997 British Grand Prix.]]In 1997 he was teamed with Damon Hill at Arrows, and embarrassed the world champion by outqualifying him at the challenging Spa circuit in Belgium, and then again at the tough Suzuka circuit. He remained at the team in 1998 alongside Mika Salo, matching his higher-rated team-mate for points. Two seasons with Sauber were largely unspectacular in terms of results, although he outscored team-mate Jean Alesi in 1999. He had a huge crash in the 1999 European Grand Prix, from which he was lucky to walk away.While his reputation had advanced from his early days, it dropped again in 2000. At Hockenheim he side-swiped Alesi resulting in a huge crash, while he was blamed for an incident in Austria which damaged several cars. He decided to retire at the end of the season, buying into the Prost team, which folded a year later. By that time his relationship with team-owner Alain Prost had soured.
