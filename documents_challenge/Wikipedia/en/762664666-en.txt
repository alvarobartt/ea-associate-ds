III &amp; IV line-ups of Deep Purple.HistoryHughes fronted Finders Keepers in the 1960s as bassist/vocalist, as well as the British funk rock band Trapeze. Hughes then went on to serve as bassist/vocalist for Deep Purple between 1973 and 1976, embarking on a solo career following his departure from the group. In 1982, he joined with ex-Pat Travers guitarist Pat Thrall to form Hughes/Thrall, they released one self-titled album which went virtually unnoticed at the time but is now often cited by many fans/musicians to be the their favourite Glenn Hughes album. In the mid-1980s, Hughes recorded several different albums with bands and artists including Phenomena,("Phenomena" Phenomena II: Dream Runner"), Gary Moore ("Run For Cover"), and Black Sabbath ("Seventh Star", though this was to have been a solo album by Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, and only came out as a Sabbath album due to record label pressure). Beginning in the mid 80's, Glenn's health problems due to over eating/drugs/alcohol began to seriously affect his musical projects, and this contributed to very short stints with Gary Moore and Tony Iommi, as Glenn was unable to tour with them properly due to his bad health. By the end of the 1980s, Hughes' ongoing drug problem was derailing him, and it wasn't until 1991 that a clean, sober and fully rejuvenated Glenn Hughes returned with the hit "America: What Time Is Love?" with the KLF. He also recorded a melodic rock album ("Face The Truth") with former Europe guitarist, John Norum, prior to re-embarking on an international solo career that he's primarily focused on to this day. In 1999, Glenn Hughes did a short tribute tour to Tommy Bolin in Texas, with Tommy's brother Johnny (of Black Oak Arkansas) on drums.In 2005 Hughes released "Soul Mover" supporting it with a European tour. He also collaborated with Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi on the 2005 album Fused. Hughes then released Music For The Divine in 2006, which featured Red Hot Chili Peppers Members Chad Smith and John Frusciante. Hughes toured in support of the album throughout Europe in autumn 2006.About to be released on edel records on November 17th 2007 is "Live in Australia", an acoustic CD and companion DVD of a performance at Sydney's famous "Basement" club. The show features songs from most recent Hughes albums, Purple classics and rare gems and covers.A new Album called First Underground Nuclear Kitchen was released on May 9 2008 in Europe and on May 12th in the Rest of the world.He announced on tour that he is currently writing his autobiography with author Joel McIver.InfluencesHe stated that he grew up listening to many Motown bass players and he was a funky kind of bassist. He has cited acts like Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, and Stevie Wonder as influences.Discography===Solo===Play Me Out (1977)L.A.
