It was used prior to the official adoption of the Revised Romanization by the South Korean Government in 2000. (pronounced ˈpuˈsɑn) is the largest port city in the Republic of Korea. With a population of about 3.65 million, Busan is also South Korea's second largest metropolis, after Seoul. The most densely built up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong River and Suyeong River, with mountains separating some of the various districts.Busan was the host city of the 2002 Asian Games and APEC 2005 Korea. It was also one of the host cities for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and is the center for international conventions in Korea. Administratively, it is designated as a Metropolitan City. On November 14, 2005, the city officially announced its bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics Games.HistoryGeochilsan-guk existed in the second and third centuries as a chiefdom of Jinhan. It was absorbed by Silla and renamed Geochilsan-gun. The word Geochilsan means rough mountain, probably referring to Hwangnyeongsan, located at the center of the city.The grave goods excavated from mounded burials at Bokcheon-dong indicate that a complex chiefdom ruled by powerful individuals was present in the Busan area just as the Three Kingdoms of Korea were forming, c. A.D. 300-400. The mounded burials of Bokcheon-dong were built along the top of a ridge that overlooks a wide area that makes up parts of modern-day Dongnae-gu and Yeonje-gu. Archaeologists excavated more than 250 iron weapons and ingots from Burial No. 38, a wooden chamber tomb at Bokcheon-dong.In 757, Geochilsan-gun was again renamed Dongnae, which it is still called.From the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Korean government designated Busan as a trading port with the Japanese and allowed their settlement. Other Japanese settlements in Ulsan and Jinhae diminished later, but the Busan settlement, called Waegwan at the time, continued until Japan invaded Korea in 1592. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new shogunate in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan Waegwan was permitted to be reconstructed. The Japanese settlement, though relocated into Choryang later, continued to exist until Korea was exposed to modern diplomacy in 1876. In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea.During the Japanese occupation, Busan(Japanese name:Fuzan) developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam tramway before electrification was introduced in 1924. Busan, along with Jeju City, is the only city in Korea, with the exemption of Daegu, that was never taken by the North Korean Communists during the Korean War. As a result the city was a refugee camp site for Koreans during the war.  Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War and for some time it served as a temporary capital of Republic of Korea. UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and autumn of 1950. Since then, like Seoul, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character.GeographyBusan is located on the Southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. Itis located right next to the sea, which determined the development of the whole city itselfClimate Located on the Southeasternmost tip of the Korean Peninsula, Busan has a humid subtropical climate. Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. May to July, Late Springs and Early Summers, are usually cooler than inland region because of the ocean effect. Late Summer and Early Autumn, August and September, are generally hot and humid. The city may experiences typhoons at that time. On September 15 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed coast of the city and caused catastrophic effect. October and November are best seasons for living with clear skies and comfortable temperature. Winters are cold and dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea except Jeju-do and several island of southern coast. Busan and nearby area is the least snowiest region of Korea due to its location. Even little accumulation of snowfall can effectively shut down this seaport city because of the hilly terrain and unfamiliarity of motorists driving on snow.Administrative divisionsIn 1957 Busan adopted a division system with the creation of 6 gu: Busanjin-gu, Dong-gu, Dongnae-gu, Jung-gu, Seo-gu, and Yeongdo-gu.Today, Busan is divided into 15 gu (districts) and 1 gun (county).Buk-gu (북구; 北區)Busanjin-gu (부산진구; 釜山鎭區)Dong-gu (동구; 東區)Dongnae-gu (동래구; 東萊區)Gangseo-gu (강서구; 江西區)Geumjeong-gu (금정구; 金井區)Haeundae-gu (해운대구; 海雲臺區)Jung-gu (중구; 中區)Nam-gu (남구; 南區)Saha-gu (사하구; 沙下區)Sasang-gu (사상구; 沙上區)Seo-gu (서구; 西區)Suyeong-gu (수영구; 水營區)Yeongdo-gu (영도구; 影島區)Yeonje-gu (연제구; 蓮堤區)Gijang-gun (기장군; 機張郡)EconomyTransportation and shipping are among the most high profile aspects of the local economy. Since 1978, Busan has opened three container ports including Jaseungdae, Shinsundae and Gamman. Busan is renowned as one of the world's largest ports and can handle up to 13.2 million TEU shipping containers per year. .]] The Busan-Jinhae Free Economic Zone Authority, one of two such administrations (the other in the harbor of Incheon), was created to continue the tradition of Busan's status as an international trading centre. The port attracts ships from all over the globe and aspires to become a regional financial centre. Currently, Busan is ranked internationally as the third largest seaport in terms of cargo volume and efficiency by the American Association of Port Authorities.Shopping and CommerceCommercial areas are dispersed throughout the city near busy intersections and adjacent to university campuses, but the two largest central business districts in Busan are Seomyeon and Gwangbok-dong/Nampo-dong.
