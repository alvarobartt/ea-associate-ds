 Next album  = ''[[Point of Entry]]''&lt;br /&gt;(1981) |British Steel is the sixth album by Judas Priest, released on April 14 1980 (see 1980 in music). The album was remastered in 2001, with two bonus tracks added. It is one of their most popular recordings and is widely regarded as one of the band's best efforts, along with, Killing Machine, Screaming for Vengeance and Painkiller. "Breaking the Law", "United", and "Living After Midnight" were released as singles.The album was recorded at Tittenhurst Park, which was the home of the Beatle Ringo Starr. Sampling did not yet exist at the time of recording, so the band recorded the sounds of smashing milk bottles to be included in "Breaking the Law", as well as various sounds in "Metal Gods" produced by "trays of cutlery" and "billiard cues."The original UK release was initially at a discount price of £3.99: the advertisments in the music press bearing the legend, 'British Steal'.The 2001 reissue bonus track "Red, White, and Blue" was written sometime during the earlier years of Priest's career. It was recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau in July of 1985. Judas Priest explains this track in the remaster booklet as follows:"This is a great song which was written as an anthem for audience participation AKA "United" or "Take On the World" and although a little tongue-in-cheek, it is also very patriotic and may bring a tear to your eye! We felt that the end tag of Rule Britannia was very fitting for a British band especially on an album entitled British Steel."The second bonus track, a live performance of "Grinder", was recorded on May 5, 1984, in Los Angeles during the Defenders of the Faith tour.Anthrax guitar player Scott Ian said in an interview in the documentary Heavy Metal: Louder than Life that British Steel was probably the album that really defined heavy metal, because it, according to him, did away with the "last shards of blues" that had otherwise been characteristic of the genre. He said, "Even the title... how does it get more metal than that?"It was featured in the Classic Albums documentary series.Track listingThe UK vinyl and the remastered CDAll songs written by Rob Halford, K.K.
