 The Presidents' Trophy is an award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL) to the team which finishes with the most points in the league during the regular season. If two teams tie each other with the most points, then the trophy goes to whichever team accumulated the most wins. The winning team is also awarded $350,000 in cash bonuses. The Presidents' Trophy has been awarded 21 times to 12 different teams since first being awarded in 1985. The most recent recipients of the trophy were the Detroit Red Wings who finished the 2007-08 season with 54 wins and 115 points.HistoryThe trophy was introduced at the start of the 1985-86 NHL season by the league's Board of Governors. Prior to this, the best team in the league during the regular season was allowed to hang a banner stating "NHL League Champions".  The winning team is also awarded 350,000 Canadian dollars, to be shared between the team and its players. While only seven of all the Presidents' Trophy winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup in their respective years, it remains the most likely position to produce the cup winner, because the Presidents' Trophy winner is guaranteed home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided the team advances that far.From 1937 to 1968, the same criterion now observed for winning the Presidents' Trophy was used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy.  With the Modern Era expansion in the 1967-68 season and the creation of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. However, no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the entire league during this period, and no trophy at all was awarded based on the results of the regular season from the 1981-82 season through the 1984-85 season; the Wales and Campbell trophies were transferred to the playoff champions of those conferences in 1981-82. A cash bonus was given to each player on the team with the league's best regular-season record during these years, to which the Presidents' Trophy was added in 1985-86.The only team to have won the Presidents' Trophy more than twice is the Detroit Red Wings, with six. However, the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall 21 times, the most times in league history, although they have yet to win the Presidents' Trophy. Detroit is second with 18 first-overall finishes.Winnersof the Detroit Red Wings has been part of the team's six Presidents' Trophy wins.]]  played for the 2000-01 Colorado Avalanche and the 2006-07 Buffalo Sabres.]]  YearWinnerPointsPlayoff ResultWin #1985-86]]Edmonton Oilers119CGY]])11986-87]]Edmonton Oilers105Won Stanley Cup21987-88]]Calgary Flames105EDM]])11988-89]]Calgary Flames117Won Stanley Cup21989-90]]Boston Bruins101EDM]])11990-91]]Chicago Blackhawks106MIN]])11991-92]]New York Rangers105PIT]])11992-93]]Pittsburgh Penguins119NYI]])11993-94]]New York Rangers112Won Stanley Cup21994-95]]Detroit Red Wings070NJ]])11995-96]]Detroit Red Wings131COL]])21996-97]]Colorado Avalanche107DET]])11997-98]]Dallas Stars109DET]])11998-99]]Dallas Stars114Won Stanley Cup21999-00]]St. Louis Blues]]114SJ]])12000-01]]Colorado Avalanche118Won Stanley Cup22001-02]]Detroit Red Wings116Won Stanley Cup32002-03]]Ottawa Senators113NJ]])12003-04]]Detroit Red Wings109CGY]])42004-05]]No winner because of the2004-05 NHL lockout---2005-06]]Detroit Red Wings124EDM]])52006-07]]Buffalo Sabres113OTT]])12007-08]]url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=233471&amp;hubname=|title=Red Wings clinch Presidents' Trophy |accessdate=2008-04-03|date=2008-04-03|publisher=The Sports Network115Won Stanley Cup6ReferencesGeneralSpecific  Category:National Hockey League trophies and awardscs:Presidents' Trophy da:Presidents' Trophy de:Presidents' Trophy es:Trofeo de los Presidentes fr:Trophée du Président hr:Presidents' Trophy it:Presidents' Trophy nl:Presidents' Trophy pl:Presidents' Trophy ru:Президентский Кубок simple:Presidents' Trophy fi:Presidents' Trophy sv:Presidents' Trophy uk:Кубок Президента (НХЛ)
