He returned to win his doubles match, teaming with Nenad Zimonjic, before being forced to retire during his singles match with Nikolay Davydenko.Playing styleDjokovic is an all-court player. His greatest strengths includes his dominant groundstrokes, especially the forehand which are powerful, deep, well angled, and hit with strong topspin, although his preferred groundstroke is the backhand. With considerable speed, his serve is one of his major weapons winning many free points from his flatter first serve and employing a sharp curving kick serve as his second serve. Djokovic, while very sound and powerful from the baseline, often finishes points by coming to the net similar to Roger Federer. He also utilizes a well-disguised backhand underspin dropshot and sliced backhand (groundstroke) in his repertoire.EquipmentDjokovic endorses/is sponsored by Wilson and adidas; he is currently using the Wilson KBlade Tour racquet strung with Wilson Champions Choice.
