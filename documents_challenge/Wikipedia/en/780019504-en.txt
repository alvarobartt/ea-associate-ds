 Axayacatl (pron.  - the name means "Water-mask" or "Water-face") was a ruler (tlatoani) of the Postclassic Mesoamerican Aztec Empire and city of Tenochtitlán, who reigned from 1469 to 1481.He is chiefly remembered for subjugating Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlán's sister city, in 1473. Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, he invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, Moquihuix, and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy. It is also important that the Great Sun Stone, also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership.He was preceded on the throne by Moctezuma I and followed by his brother Tízoc in 1481.NotesReferences  Category:Year of birth missing Category:1481 deaths Category:Tenochca tlatoque Category:Nahuatl-language poetscs:Axayacatl de:Axayacatl es:Axayácatl fr:Axayacatl it:Axayacatl lb:Axayacatl nah:Āxāyacatl nl:Axayacatl ja:アシャヤカトル no:Āxāyacatl pl:Axayacatl pt:Axayacatl sv:Axayacatl
