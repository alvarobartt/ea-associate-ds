The Spartacus International Gay Guide is an international gay travel guidebook published annually since 1970, originally by John D. Stamford, currently by Bruno Gm√ºnder Verlag in Berlin, Germany.ContentThe guide is arranged alphabetically by country and offers short texts in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian about each one. Cities that are major gay travel destinations are also described. Each country section includes a summary of current laws about homosexuality in each country. The majority of the book's contents are listings for institutions which cater to gay tourists or which gay travelers may find interesting, such as bars, hotels, gay saunas, beaches, support groups, and AIDS hotlines. These listings are arranged by city within each country. Recent editions have been over 1200 pages, with information for approximately 22,000 businesses in 160 countries.The criteria for which businesses to include in the listings differ from country to country. In a country or city with a large number of businesses catering specifically to gay customers, only those &ndash; or even only the most noteworthy &ndash; are included; in a country where such businesses are uncommon, those which cater to a general clientele but are "gay friendly" are included.References
