  Fulda () is a city in Hesse, Germany; it is located on the Fulda River and is the administrative seat of the Fulda district (Kreis).HistoryEarly Middle AgesThe Benedictine monastery of Fulda was founded in 744 by Saint Sturm, a disciple of Saint Boniface, as one of Boniface's outposts in the reorganization of the church in Germany, and a base from which missionaries accompanied Charlemagne's armies in their political and military campaign to destroy heathen Saxony.The initial grant for the abbey was signed by Carloman, the son of Charles Martel. The support of the Mayors of the Palace and later, the early Pippinid and Carolingian rulers, was important to Boniface's success. Fulda also received support from many of the leading families of the Carolingian world. Sturm, whose tenure as abbot lasted from 747 until 779, was most likely related to the Agilolfing dukes of Bavaria. Fulda also received large and constant donations from the Etichonids, a leading family in Alsatia, and the Conradines, predecessors of the Salian Holy Roman Emperors. Under Sturm, the donations Fulda received from these and other important families helped in the establishment of daughter houses Johannesberg and Petersberg near Fulda.and being martyred, from the Sacramentary of Fulda,]] After his martyrdom by the Frisians, the relics of Saint Boniface were brought back to Fulda. Because of the stature this afforded the monastery, the donations increased, and Fulda could establish daughter houses further away, for example in Hameln. Meanwhile Saint Lullus, successor of Boniface as archbishop of Mainz, tried to absorb the abbey into his archbishopric, but failed. This was one reason that he founded Hersfeld Abbey, to limit the attempts of the enlargement of Fulda.Between 790 and 819 the community rebuilt the main monastery church to more fittingly house the relics. They based their new basilica on the original 4th-century (since demolished) Old Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, using the transept and crypt plan of that great pilgrimage church to frame their own saint as the "Apostle to the Germans". The crypt of the original abbey church still holds those relics, but the church itself has been subsumed into a Baroque renovation. A small, 9th century chapel remains standing within walking distance of the church, as do the foundations of a later women's abbey.The great scholar Rabanus Maurus was abbot from 822 to 842.﻿From its foundation on the abbey Fulda and its territory was based on an Imperial grant and therefore a sovereign principality subject only to the German emperor. Fulda was made a bishopric in 1752 and the prince-abbots were given the additional title of prince-bishop. The prince-abbots (and later prince-bishops) ruled Fulda and the surrounding region until the bishopric was forcibly dissolved by Napoleon's minions in 1802.  1655]] The city went through baroque building campaign in the 18th century, resulting in the current “Baroque City” status. This included a remodel of the Dom (Cathedral) of Fulda (1704-1712) and the ''Stadtschloss ''(Castle-Palace, 1707-1712) by Johann Dientzenhofer. The city parish church, St. Blasius, was built between 1771–1785.From 1764 until 1789 Fulda had a porcelain factory. Because of its quality and rarity, it is much prized by collectors. The factory was begun under Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Heinrich von Bibra and closed down shortly after his death by his successor, Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Harstall.Rulers of Fulda until SecularizationAbbotsSt. Sturmius 744-779Baugulf 779-802Ratgar 802-817Eigil von Fulda 818-822Rabanus Maurus 822-842Hatto I. 842-856Thioto 856-869Sigihart 869-891Huoggi 891-915Helmfried 915-916Haicho 917-923Hiltibert 923-927Hadamar 927-956Hatto II. 956-968Werinheri 968-982Branthoh I. 982-991Hatto III. 991-997Erkanbald 997-1011Branthoh II. 1011-1013Poppo 1013-1018, also Abbot of Lorsch (Franconian Babenberger)Richard 1018-1039Sigiwart 1039-1043Rohing 1043-1047Egbert 1047-1058Siegfrid I. von Mainz (Sigfried von Eppenstein) 1058-1060Widerad von Eppenstein 1060-1075Ruothart 1075-1096Godefrid 1096-1109Wolfhelm 1109-1114Erlolf von Bergholz 1114-1122Ulrich von Kemnaten 1122-1126Heinrich I. von Kemnaten 1126-1132Bertho I. von Schlitz 1132-1134Konrad I. 1134-1140Aleholf 1140-1148Rugger I. 1148Heinrich II. von Bingarten 1148-1149Markward I. 1150-1165Gernot von Fulda 1165Hermann 1165-1168Burchard Graf von Nürings 1168-1176Rugger II. 1176-1177Konrad II. 1177-1192Heinrich III. von Kronberg im Taunus 1192-1216Hartmann I. 1216-1217Kuno 1217-1221Prince-AbbotsKonrad III. von Malkes 1221-1249Heinrich IV. von Erthal 1249-1261Bertho II. von Leibolz 1261-1271Bertho III. von Mackenzell 1271-1272Bertho IV. von Biembach 1273-1286Markward II. von Bickenbach 1286-1288Heinrich V.

The former East/West German border passed just east of Fulda, and large Soviet and East German forces were stationed in the area during the Cold War. Considered during the Cold War to be a potential invasion route for Communist forces, the U.S. Army stationed the 14th and later the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiments in the city and surrounding areas as the screening force for the U.S. V Corps. The cavalry regiments generally enjoyed a good relationship with the town and its citizens.PeopleAdam of FuldaTobias SammetMartin HohmannFerdinand BraunSebastian KehlFranz Kaspar (or Caspar) LiebleinMax SternDirk SauerFr.
