He has been a member of the Brazilian Série A club São Paulo since September 7, 1990, playing more than 700 matches and winning 2 Copa Libertadores trophies and 3 World Club Championship with them. He is officially recognised by FIFA and the IFFHS as the goalkeeper to have scored the most goals in the history of football: 82.ClubDespite his position, Rogério Ceni has established a reputation as a goalscorer, similar to Paraguay's José Luis Chilavert, Mexico's Jorge Campos, and Colombia's Rene Higuita. He has often taken penalties for São Paulo as well. On August 20 2006, he scored his 63rd goal by netting a free kick against Cruzeiro in the Brazilian League, a few minutes after denying a penalty kick for Cruzeiro that would take the match to a 0-3 score. Later on in the same match, he scored a penalty kick and reached 64 goals - 21 from penalties and 43 from free kicks, a goal that tied the match 2-2. This record put Ceni on top, over Chilavert (2nd), two goals under the record of Brazilian goalkeeper. He has scored 82 goals in 819 appearances - from 35 penalties and 47 free kicks so far (August 10, 2008).On July 14, 2005, Rogério was São Paulo's captain as the team won the 2005 Copa Libertadores for the third time. Two weeks later, in a match against Atlético Paranaense, he became the most-capped player in São Paulo FC history, with 618 matches played. He wore a special commemorative jersey that had the number "618" printed on the back. In December 2005, he was named Man of the Match for his outstanding performance during the 1-0 victory against Liverpool in the FIFA Club World Cup final match and also awarded by FIFA as the Best Player of the tournament. On July 25, 2006 he scored a penalty kick winner against Mexican side Chivas, becoming São Paulo's Copa Libertadores all-time leading scorer.On October 29, 2006, Rogerio made his 700th appearance for São Paulo against Figueirense in a 2-0 victory. But some of the gloss was taken off the occasion when Rogerio - who captained the team that won the Libertadores Cup and Club World championship last year - was ordered to change his bright yellow jersey, because it clashed with the referee's, so he played with the reserve goalkeeper's shirt. In the same year, on November 19, Ceni won his first (and São Paulo's fourth) Campeonato Brasileiro title. In the following year, Ceni won the same title, being elected by CBF as the Best Player in 2007's Campeonato Brasileiro.CountryRogério Ceni has played 17 caps for the Brazilian national team, and was the third-choice goalkeeper on the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning squad. He was selected by coach Carlos Alberto Parreira to the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad as the second goalie. His only playing time in the tournament were the last ten minutes of the second half of Brazil's 4-1 group stage victory over Japan as a substitute for Dida.Career StatisticsClubSeasonDomesticLeagueDomesticCupsContinentalCompetitionsOtherTournamentsTotalAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsSinop1990]]------?0?0Total------?0?0São Paulo1992]]00--0000001993]]10--001001101994]]50--801102401995]]3040--1201901996]]00001030401997]]253401103307331998]]22060502525821999]]23130812926342000]]243121503437592001]]23060402425722002]]21181--2235152003]]41260801306822004]]443--162906952005]]3910--16520575202006]]288--13313554162007]]357--1302026892008]] *153--90211454Total34941492117112992580782Career Total349414921171182HonoursSinopSão PauloInternationalPersonalReferencesContract4th December 2006 to 31st July 2010External links CBF Official Site IFFHS Top Division goal scorer ranking among Goalkeepers    Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Football (soccer) goalkeepers Category:Brazilians of Italian descent Category:Sinop Futebol Clube players Category:São Paulo Futebol Clube players Category:1997 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:Brazil international footballers Category:Brazilians of German descentar:روجيريو سيني bg:Рожерио Сени de:Rogério Ceni es:Rogério Ceni eo:Rogério Ceni fr:Rogério Ceni it:Rogério Ceni lt:Rogério Ceni nl:Rogério Ceni ja:ロジェリオ・セニ no:Rogério Ceni pl:Rogério Ceni pt:Rogério Ceni ru:Рожерио Сени fi:Rogério Ceni vi:Rogério Ceni tr:Rogério Ceni zh:羅渣里奧
