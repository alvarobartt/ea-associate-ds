in 1839]]A stele (from Greek: , stēlē, ; plural: stelae, , stēlai, ; also found: Latinised singular stela and Anglicised plural steles) is a stone or wooden slab, generally taller than it is wide, erected for funerals or commemorative purposes, most usually decorated with the names and titles of the deceased or living — inscribed, carved in relief (bas-relief, sunken-relief, high-relief, etc), or painted onto the slab.History and functionStelae were also used as territorial markers, as the boundary stelae of Akhenaton at Amarna,Memoirs By Egypt Exploration Society Archaeological Survey of Egypt 1908, p. 19 or to commemorate military victories.e.g. Piye's victory stela (M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature Vol 3, The University of California Press 1980, , pp.66ff) or Shalmaneser's stela at Saluria (Boardman, op.cit, p.335) They were widely used in the Ancient Near East, Greece, Egypt, Ethiopia, and, most likely independently, in China and some Buddhist cultures (see the Nestorian Stele), and, more surely independently, by Mesoamerican civilisations, notably the OlmecPool, op.cit., p.265 and Maya.Pool, op.cit., p.277 The huge number of stelae surviving from ancient Egypt and in Central America constitute one of the largest and most significant sources of information on those civilisations. An informative stele of Tiglath-Pileser III is preserved in the British Museum. Two stelae built into the walls of a church are major documents relating to the Etruscan language.Unfinished standing stones, set up without inscriptions from Libya in North Africa to Scotland were monuments of pre-literate Megalithic cultures in the Late Stone Age. The Pictish stones of Scotland, often intricately carved, date from between the 6th and 9th centuries.In 1489, 1512, and 1663 CE, the Kaifeng Jews of China left these stone monuments to preserve their origin and history. Despite repeated flooding of the Yellow River, destroying their synagogue time and time again, these stelae survived to tell their tale.An obelisk is a specialized kind of stele. The Insular high crosses of Ireland and Britain are specialized stelae. Likewise, the Totem pole of North and South America is a type of stelae. Gravestones with inscribed epitaph are also kinds of stelae.Most recently, in the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, the architect Peter Eisenman created a field of some 2,700 blank stelae.Till, op.cit., p.168 The memorial is meant to be read not only as the field, but also as an erasure of data that refer to memory of the Holocaust.Notable individual stelae .]]Axumite SteleStele of Naram-SinCode of HammurabiGwanggaeto SteleNestorian SteleUkrainian stone stelaLemnos stelaLapis NigerFor Israel/Egypt:Merneptah SteleMesha SteleFor Egypt:Rosetta StoneBoundary Stelae of AkhenatenPalermo stoneThe Stele of RevealingIn the Western Hemisphere:Peru: Raimondi StelaMexico: Stela C at Tres ZapotesMexico: Izapa Stela 5Mexico: La Mojarra Stela 1Gallery Image:Egyptian funerary stela.jpg|Ancient Egyptian funerary stele Image:Healing Stela of Horus.jpg|Healing stele of Horus-(a Cippus of Horus).
