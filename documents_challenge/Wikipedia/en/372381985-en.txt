In physics and engineering, the Fourier number (Fo) or Fourier modulus, named after Joseph Fourier, is a dimensionless number that characterizes heat conduction. Conceptually, it is the ratio of the heat conduction rate to the rate of thermal energy storage. It is a dimensionless time, which with the Biot number, characterizes transient conduction problems. It is defined as:\mbox = \fracwhere:&alpha; is the thermal diffusivity m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/st is the characteristic time sR is the length through which conduction occurs mIf the number is greater than 0.2, a one term approximation can be used.For transient mass transfer by diffusion, there is an analogous mass Fourier Number (also denoted Fo) defined as:\mbox = \fracwhere:"D" is the Diffusivity"t" is the characteristic timescale"L" is the length scale of interestReferencesFundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, Incropera & DeWittSee alsoHeat equationCategory:Dimensionless numbersde:Fourier-Zahl es:Número de Fourier fr:Nombre de Fourier nl:Getal van Fourier pl:Liczba Fouriera ru:Число Фурье fi:Fourier'n luku
