It was introduced on November 1, 1993, replacing the Russian ruble at a rate of 1 manat = 500 ruble. The ISO 4217 code is TMM and the manat is subdivided into 100 tennesi. The abbreviation m is sometimes used, e.g., 25 000 m is twenty-five thousand manat.EtymologyThe word "manat" is borrowed from the Russian word "moneta" meaning "coin". Likewise, 'manat' was the name of the Soviet ruble in both Azeri and Turkmen.CoinsIn 1993, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 tennesi. The 1, 5 and 10 tennesi were struck in copper-plated-steel, with the higher denominations in nickel-plated-steel. After a period of inflation, new coins of 500 and 1000 manat were introduced in 1999.

These were followed by notes for 1000 manat in 1995 and 5000 and 10,000 manat in 1996. In 2005, a new series of notes was introduced in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 manat. All notes bear a portrait of former president Saparmurat Niyazov.Redenomination, the new manatIn October 2007 the Turkmen opposition news website Gundogar reported, citing sources at De La Rue, that in January 1st of 2009 Turkmenistan plans to redenominate the manat at the rate of 5,000 to 1 due to inflation http://www.turkmenistan.ru/?page_id=3&amp;lang_id=en&amp;elem_id=13549&amp;type=event&amp;sort=date_desc&lt;/ref&gt;. Only the highest valued banknote, 500 manat, is planned to bear the portrait of Saparmurat Niyazov, while the others are supposed to have images of buildings in Ashgabat and portraits of Ahmed Sanjar, Oguz Khan, Magtymguly Pyragy and other figures of Turkmen history.Манаты без Туркменбаши, Аскар Турсунбаев, Гундогар   Will be printed banknotes in denominations of:1 manat = 5,000 old manat5 manat = 25,000 old manat10 manat = 50,000 old manat20 manat = 100,000 old manat50 manat = 250,000 old manat100 manat = 500,000 old manat500 manat = 2,500,000 old manat Coins will be minted with the following denominations:1 tenge = 50 old manat2 tenge = 100 old manat5 tenge = 250 old manat10 tenge = 500 old manat20 tenge = 1,000 old manat50 tenge = 2,500 old manatBlack market exchangeThe manat has a large disparity between its official and black market rates, with the latter being roughly 21% greater than the official. This results in few institutions outside Turkmen Governmental control supporting the official rate. A few multinational companies have continued to adhere to the official rate - such as British Airways - but generally only for purchases by Turkmen passport holders in the country itself.See alsoEconomy of TurkmenistanAzerbaijani manatReferencesFootnotesExternal linksCoins of former Soviet republics Category:Economy of Turkmenistanbe:Туркменскі манат ca:Manat turcman cs:Turkmenský manat de:Turkmenistan-Manat el:Μανάτ του Τουρκμενιστάν es:Manat turkmeno fr:Manat turkmène bpy:তুর্কমেন মানাত it:Manat turkmeno lt:Turkmėnijos manatas hu:Türkmén manat nl:Turkmeense manat pl:Manat turkmeński ro:Manat turkmen ru:Туркменский манат fi:Turkmenistanin manat tg:Манати Туркманистон tr:Manat (Türkmenistan) uk:Туркменський манат zh:土庫曼馬納特
