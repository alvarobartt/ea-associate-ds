 TeXnicCenter is a free open source IDE for the LaTeX typesetting language. It uses the MiKTeX or TeX Live distributions. It allows the user to type documents in LaTeX and to compile them in PDF, DVI or PS. A menu gives access easily to precoded elements and environments (formulas, symbols, sections). It also allows for the creation of projects to organise and access the sections and environments of documents, and to insert a bibliography (using BibTeX) and an index (using MakeIndex).To use TeXLive 2005 distribution, you need to make a minor change to the output profiles by replacing each of the output argument options with their Unix format variants (even for running on Windows), e.g. the command line arguments "%pm" becomes "%Pm" and "%bm" becomes "%Bm".Interoperability with other softwareTeXnicCenter has been designed to work with the MiKTeX distribution. After installation, TeXnicCenter recognizes MiKTeX and sets up the paths to command-line compilers bundled with MiKTeX automatically. Similarly, Adobe Acrobat Reader/Professional and Foxit Reader, when available, is configured as a viewer for the generated PDF documents. Acrobat can also be configured to close an opened PDF file before recompiling it with LaTeX. These operations are accomplished using Dynamic Data Exchange calls, documented in Acrobat Interapplication Communication Overview and Acrobat Interapplication Communication Reference.Instructions on how to set up TeXnicCenter to work with Adobe Acrobat Reader/Professional 7.x can be found in http://texnik.dante.de/cgi-bin/mainFAQ.cgi?file=gui/TeXnikCenter. The same instructions apply to Adobe Acrobat Reader/Professional 8.0.0, but the DDE calls have to be modified as proposed in http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc27d26 because of a bug in this version of Acrobat.See alsoComparison of text editorsList of text editorsLyX, an open source cross-platform editor and shellTexmaker, an open source cross-platform editor and shellWinShell, a freeware editorExternal linksTeXnicCenter homepageTeXnicCenter on SourceForgeCategory:Free TeX editors Category:TeX SourceForge projectsde:TeXnicCenter es:TeXnicCenter fr:TeXnicCenter nl:TeXnicCenter pl:TeXnicCenter sq:TeXnicCenter sv:TeXnicCenter
