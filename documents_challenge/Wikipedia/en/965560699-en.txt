These stunts are sometimes rigged so that they look dangerous while still having safety mechanisms, but often they are as dangerous as they appear to be. There is an inherent risk in the performance of all stunt work in film, television and stage work. Daredevil performers are distinct from stunt performers and stunt doubles, as they perform their stunts purely for the sake of the stunt itself, often before an audience for their entertainment and personal monetary gain for the event, while a stunt performer, or stunt double typically performs stunts intended for use in a motion pictures or dramatized television (although one person could certainly be both, as was the case with Harry Houdini, Jackie Chan, Christian Bale, Tony Jaa, Chuck Norris, and Nick Lowe among others). Stunt performers and stunt doubles are generally skilled at performing physical action in character for film and television.See alsoPyrotechnicianSecond unitSpecial effectStreet stuntsStuntStunt coordinatorTricksterCategory:Stunt performersbs:Kaskader cs:Kaskadérství de:Stuntman es:Doble (cine) fa:بدلکاری fi:Sijaisnäyttelijä fr:Cascadeur he:פעלולן hr:Kaskader id:Pemeran pengganti lv:Kaskadieris nl:Stuntman ja:スタント pl:Kaskader pt:Dublê ru:Каскадёр simple:Stuntman sq:Kaskaderi sr:Kaskader sv:Stuntman tr:Dublör (sinema)
