 The Frank J. Selke Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League forward who demonstrates the most skill in the defensive component of the game. The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association following the regular season.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been awarded 30 times to 20 different players since the 1977-78 NHL season. The current holder is Pavel Datsyuk.HistoryThe trophy was first awarded at the end of the 1977-78 NHL season. It was named after Frank J. Selke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens.The first recipient was Bob Gainey of the Canadiens, who won the trophy the first four years it was given, and to date he has won it more times than any other player. Players from the Montreal Canadiens have won the trophy the most times, with 7 times, yet only two different players won it with the Canadiens. Gainey won it four times and Guy Carbonneau won it three times. Players from the Detroit Red Wings, Sergei Fedorov (twice), Steve Yzerman, Kris Draper, and Pavel Datsyuk have combined for five Selke award trophies.There has been only one instance in which a Selke Trophy winner was also awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player, which was when Sergei Fedorov captured both trophies during the 1993-94 NHL season. There has not been an instance in which the Art Ross Trophy winner has been awarded the Selke Trophy, though Fedorov finished second in regular season scoring in 1994, while Art Ross Trophy runner-up Joe Sakic finished second in Selke voting in 2001.Winners, one-time winner.]] , one-time winner.]] , two-time winner.]]+Positions keyCCentre]]RWRight Wing]]LWLeft Wing]]SeasonWinnerTeamPositionWin #1977–78]]Gainey|Bob GaineyMontreal CanadiensLW11978–79]]Gainey|Bob GaineyMontreal CanadiensLW21979–80]]Gainey|Bob GaineyMontreal CanadiensLW31980–81]]Gainey|Bob GaineyMontreal CanadiensLW41981–82]]Kasper|Steve KasperBoston BruinsC11982–83]]Clarke|Bobby ClarkePhiladelphia FlyersC11983–84]]Jarvis|Doug JarvisWashington CapitalsC11984–85]]Ramsay|Craig RamsayBuffalo SabresLW11985–86]]Murray|Troy MurrayChicago Black Hawks]]C11986–87]]Poulin|Dave PoulinPhiladelphia FlyersC11987–88]]Carbonneau|Guy CarbonneauMontreal CanadiensC11988–89]]Carbonneau|Guy CarbonneauMontreal CanadiensC21989–90]]Meagher|Rick MeagherSt. Louis Blues]]C11990–91]]Graham|Dirk GrahamChicago BlackhawksRW11991–92]]Carbonneau|Guy CarbonneauMontreal CanadiensC31992–93]]Gilmour|Doug GilmourToronto Maple LeafsC11993–94]]Federov|Sergei FedorovDetroit Red WingsC11994–95]]Francis|Ron FrancisPittsburgh PenguinsC11995–96]]Federov|Sergei FedorovDetroit Red WingsC21996–97]]Peca|Michael PecaBuffalo SabresC11997–98]]Lehtinen|Jere LehtinenDallas StarsRW11998–99]]Lehtinen|Jere LehtinenDallas StarsRW21999–2000]]Yzerman|Steve YzermanDetroit Red WingsC12000–01]]Madden|John MaddenNew Jersey DevilsC12001–02]]Peca|Michael PecaNew York IslandersC22002–03]]Lehtinen|Jere LehtinenDallas StarsRW32003–04]]Draper|Kris DraperDetroit Red WingsC12004–05]]2004-05 NHL lockoutNo winner---2005–06]]Brind'Amour|Rod Brind'AmourCarolina HurricanesC12006–07]]Brind'Amour|Rod Brind'AmourCarolina HurricanesC22007–08]]Datsyuk|Pavel DatsyukDetroit Red WingsC1ReferencesGeneralFrank J.
