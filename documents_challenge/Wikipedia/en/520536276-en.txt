Yolanda of Flanders (1175 &ndash; 1219) ruled the Latin Empire in Constantinople for her husband Peter II of Courtenay from 1217 to 1219.She was the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Hainault, and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. Two of her brothers, Baldwin I and then Henry, were emperors in Constantinople. After the death of the latter in 1216 there was a brief period without an emperor, before Peter was elected. Peter sent Yolanda to Constantinople while he fought the Despotate of Epirus, during which he was captured. Because his fate was unknown (although he was probably killed), Yolanda ruled as regent. She allied with the Bulgarians against the various Byzantine successor states, and was able to make peace with Theodore I Lascaris of the Empire of Nicaea, who married her daughter. However, she soon died, in 1219.She was succeeded by her second son Robert of Courtenay because her first son did not want the throne. As Robert was still in France at the time, there was technically no emperor until he arrived in 1221.Yolanda also held Namur, which she inherited from her uncle Philip of Namur in 1212 and left to her eldest son Philip when she went to Constantinople in 1216.By Peter of Courtenay she had 10 children:Philip (d. 1226), Marquis of Namur, who declined the offer of the crown of the Latin EmpireRobert of Courtenay (d. 1228), Latin EmperorHenry (d. 1229), Marquis of NamurBaldwin II of Constantinople (d. 1273)Margaret, Marchioness of Namur, who married first Raoul d'Issoudun and then Henry count of ViandenElizabeth, who married Walter count of Bar and then Eudes sire of MontaguYolanda de Courtenay, who married Andrew II of HungaryEleanor, who married Philip of Montfort, Lord of TyreMarie de Courtenay, who married Theodore I Lascaris of the Empire of NicaeaAgnes, who married Geoffrey II Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea          Category:House of Hainaut Category:Capetian house of Courtenay Category:Latin Emperors of Constantinople Category:Latin Empresses of Constantinople Category:Margraves of Namur Category:Women of the Crusader states Category:Female regents Flandersbg:Йоланда Фландърска de:Jolante (Lateinisches Kaiserreich) el:Γιολάντα της Φλάνδρας es:Yolanda de Flandes fr:Yolande de Hainaut ko:플랑드르의 욜란다 it:Yolanda di Fiandra hu:Jolánta latin császárnő nl:Yolande van Henegouwen pl:Jolanta Flandryjska ru:Иоланта де Куртене
