The ISO 4217 currency code is UZS.Etymology In the Soviet Union, speakers of Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Uzbek called the ruble the som, and this name appeared written on the back of banknotes, among the texts for the value of the bill in all 15 official languages of the Union. The word som (sometimes transliterated "sum" or "soum") means "pure" in Kyrgyz, Uyghur and Uzbek, as well as in many other Turkic languages. The word implies "pure gold"First SomLike other republics of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan continued using Soviet/Russian ruble after independence. On July 26, 1993, a new series of Russian ruble was issued and old Soviet/Russian ruble ceased to be legal tender in Russia The Global History of Currencies - Russia Uzbekistan Economic Policy and Trade Practices. Some successor states had their national currencies before the change, some chose to continue using the pre-1993 Soviet/Russian ruble, and some chose to use both the pre-1993 and the new Russian ruble. Tables of modern monetary history: Asia implies that both old and new rubles were used in Uzbekistan.Uzbekistan replaced the ruble with som at par in on November 15, 1993 . No subdivisions of this som were issued and only banknotes were produced, in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10000 som. Because it was meant to be a transitional currency, the design was rather simplistic. All notes had the Coat of arms on obverse, and an Islamic architecture on reverse. They only differ in color and value.Second SomOn July 1, 1994, a second som was introduced at a rate of 1 new som = 1000 old som. This som is subdivided into 100 tiyin. At its introduction, 1 U.S. dollar was equal to 25 som.Coins2 series of coins have been issued for the second som. They can be easily distinguished by the script used for Uzbek. The first series was written in Cyrillic script, while the second series is written in Latin script.First SeriesImageValueCompositionDescriptionDate of mintingObverseReverseObverseReversehttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin2_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1tiin.gif1 tiyinBrass clad steelCoat of arms with 12 starsState titleValue, year of minting1994http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin2_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/3tiin.gif3 tiyinhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin2_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/5tiin.gif5 tiyinhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin1_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/10tiin.gif10 tiyinNickel clad steelCoat of arms with 12 starsState titleValue, year of minting1994http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin1_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/20tiin.gif20 tiyinhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin1_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/50tiin.gif50 tiyinhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin1_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1som1.gif1 som1997, 1998, 1999http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin1_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/5som1.gif5 som1997, 1998, 1999http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/1_3_5tiin1_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/monet/10som1.gif10 som1997, 1998, 1999, 2000Second SeriesImageValueTechnical parametersDescriptionDate of mintingDiameterMassCompositionEdgeObverseReverse1 som18.4 mm2.83 gStainless steelReededCoat of arms]] without starsBank title, year of mintingValue, map of Uzbekistan20005 som21.2 mm3.35 gBrass clad steelPlainCoat of arms]] without starsBank title, year of mintingValue, map of Uzbekistan200110 som19.75 mm2.71 gNickel clad steelPlainCoat of arms]] without starsBank title, year of mintingValue, map of Uzbekistan200125 som27 mmCoat of arms]] without starsState title, year of mintingValue, Jaloliddin Manguberdi199950 som26.1 mm8 gPlain and reeded sectionsCoat of arms without starsBank title, year of mintingValue, map of Uzbekistan2001150 som26.1 mm7.9 gValue, statue and ruin of Shahrisabz20022100 som26.9 mm7.9 gInscriptionCoat of arms]] without starsBank title, year of mintingValue, map of Uzbekistan, sunrays20043Note10th anniversary of independence2700th anniversary of the founding of Shahrisabz10th anniversary of the Uzbekistani somBanknotes1994 SeriesImageValueMain ColourDescriptionDate of printingObverseReverseObverseReversehttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/1c_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/1s.gif1 somGreen and pinkCoat of armsAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theater1994http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/3c_o.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/3c.gif3 somRedMosque of Çaçma Ayub Mazar in Bukharahttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/5c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/5c_o.gif5 somBlue and orangeCoat of arms and Islamic patternAli Shir Nawai Monument in Tashkenthttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/10c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/10c_o.gif10 somPurpleGur-e Amir in Samarkandhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/25c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/25c_o.gif25 somBlue and pinkMausoleum of Kazi Zade Rumi in Shah-i-Zindahttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/50c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/50c_o.gif50 somBrownMadrasahs in Registanhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/100c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/100c_o.gif100 somPurpleDruzhba Narodov Palace in Tashkenthttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/200c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/200c_o.gif200 somGreenCoat of armsMythological tiger mosaiс on Sher-Dor Madrasah at Registan Square in Samarkand1997http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/500c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/500c_o.gif500 somRed and some greenStatue of Timur1999http://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/1000c.gifhttp://www.cbu.uz/img/mony/banknot/1000c_o.gif1000 somGreyAmir Timur Museum in Tashkent2001See alsoEconomy of UzbekistanKyrgyzstani somReferences External linksCoins of former Soviet republics          Category:Economy of Uzbekistanca:Som uzbek cv:Сум de:Soʻm es:Som uzbeko fr:Sum (monnaie) ko:우즈베키스탄 솜 bpy:উজবেকিস্তানি সোম it:Som uzbeco lt:Uzbekistano sumas hu:Üzbég szom nl:Sum (munteenheid) pl:Sum (waluta) ru:Сум sv:Uzbekistansk som tr:Özbekistan Somu zh:烏茲別克索姆
