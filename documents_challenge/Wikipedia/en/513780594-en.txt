'''-Bold text''' Coulomb's law, developed in the 1780s by French physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb, may be stated in scalar form as follows:The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.Scalar form]]If one does not require the specific direction of the force then the simplified, scalar, version of Coulomb's law will suffice. The magnitude of the force on a charge, \scriptstyle, due to the presence of a second charge, \scriptstyle, is given by the magnitude ofF = \frac,where \scriptstyle is the separation of the charges and \scriptstyle is the electric constant. A positive force implies a repulsive interaction, while a negative force implies an attractive interaction.Coulomb's law, HyperphysicsThe prefactor, termed the Coulomb's constant (\scriptstyle), is:\begin k_e &= \frac = \frac^2 = 10^\ ^2 \\ &= 8.987\ 551\ 787\ \times 10^9 \\ \end \approx 9 \times 10^9 &ensp; Nm2C&minus;2 (also mF&minus;1).Coulomb's constant, HyperphysicsIn SI units the speed of light in vacuum ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined Current practice is to use c''0 to denote the speed of light in vacuum according to ISO 31. In the original Recommendation of 1983, the symbol ''c was used for this purpose. See [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf NIST Special Publication 330, Appendix 2, p. 45 ] as the numerical value c''0 = 299 792 458 m s−1 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/meter.html (See ''c0)] and the magnetic constant μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as 4π x 10−7 H · m−1 (See μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), leading to the definition for the electric constant of ε0 = 1/(μ0c02) ≈ 8.854 187 817 x 10−12 F m−1 (See NIST ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). In cgs units, the unit charge, esu of charge or statcoulomb, is defined so that this Coulomb force constant is 1.This formula says that the magnitude of the force is directly proportional&nbsp;to the magnitude of the charges of each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The exponent in Coulomb's Law has been found to differ from −2 by less than one in a billion.When measured in units that people commonly use (such as SI—see International System of Units), the electrostatic force constant, \scriptstyle, is numerically much much larger than the universal gravitational constant \scriptstyle. This large ratio has led to the Dirac large numbers hypothesis. This means that for objects with charge that is of the order of a unit charge © and mass of the order of a unit mass (kg), the electrostatic forces will be so much larger than the gravitational forces that the latter force can be ignored. This is not the case when Planck units are used and both charge and mass are of the order of the unit charge and unit mass. However, charged elementary particles have mass that is far less than the Planck mass while their charge is about the Planck charge so that, again, gravitational forces can be ignored. For example, the electrostatic force between an electron and a proton, which constitute a hydrogen atom, is almost 40 orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational force between them.Coulomb's law, University of TexasCoulomb's law can also be interpreted in terms of atomic units with the force expressed in Hartrees per Bohr radius, the charge in terms of the elementary charge, and the distances in terms of the Bohr radius.Electric fieldIt follows from the Lorentz Force Law that the magnitude of the electric field \scriptstyle created by a single point charge \scriptstyle is given byE = \fracFor a positive charge \scriptstyle, the direction of \scriptstyle points along lines directed radially away from the location of the point charge, while the direction is the opposite for a negative charge. The units of electric field are volts per meter or newtons per coulomb.Vector formIn order to obtain both the magnitude and direction of the force on a charge, \scriptstyle at position \scriptstyle_1, experiencing a field due to the presence of another charge, \scriptstyle at position \scriptstyle_2, the full vector form of Coulomb's law is required.\mathbf = _1 - \mathbf_2) \over |\mathbf_1 - \mathbf_2|^3 = \mathbf_,where \scriptstyle is the separation of the two charges. Note that this is simply the scalar definition of Coulomb's law with the direction given by the unit vector, \scriptstyle_, parallel with the line from charge \scriptstyle to charge \scriptstyle.If both charges have the same sign (like charges) then the product \scriptstyle is positive and the direction of the force on \scriptstyle is given by \scriptstyle_; the charges repel each other. If the charges have opposite signs then the product \scriptstyle is negative and the direction of the force on \scriptstyle is given by -\scriptstyle_; the charges attract each other.System of discrete chargesThe principle of linear superposition may be used to calculate the force on a small test charge, \scriptstyle, due to a system of \scriptstyle discrete charges:\mathbf(\mathbf) = \sum_^N  - \mathbf_i) \over |\mathbf - \mathbf_i|^3 = \sum_^N ^2\mathbf_,where \scriptstyle and \scriptstyle_i are the magnitude and position respectively of the \scriptstyle charge, \scriptstyle_ is a unit vector in the direction of \scriptstyle_ = \mathbf - \mathbf_i (a vector pointing from charge \scriptstyle to charge \scriptstyle), and \scriptstyle is the magnitude of \scriptstyle_ (the separation between charges \scriptstyle and \scriptstyle).Continuous charge distributionFor a charge distribution an integral over the region containing the charge is equivalent to an infinite summation, treating each infinitesimal element of space as a point charge \scriptstyle.For a linear charge distribution (a good approximation for charge in a wire) where \scriptstyle) gives the charge per unit length at position \scriptstyle, and \scriptstyle is an infinitesimal element of length,dq = \lambda(\mathbf)dl^\prime. Charged rods, PhysicsLab.orgFor a surface charge distribution (a good approximation for charge on a plate in a parallel plate capacitor) where \scriptstyle) gives the charge per unit area at position \scriptstyle, and \scriptstyle is an infinitesimal element of area,dq = \sigma(\mathbf)dA^\prime.For a volume charge distribution (such as charge within a bulk metal) where \scriptstyle) gives the charge per unit volume at position \scriptstyle, and \scriptstyle is an infinitesimal element of volume,dq = \rho(\mathbf)dV^\prime.The force on a small test charge \scriptstyle at position \scriptstyle is given by\mathbf = q^\prime\int dq  - \mathbf \over |\mathbf - \mathbf|^3.Graphical representationBelow is a graphical representation of Coulomb's law, when \scriptstyle. The vector \scriptstyle_1 is the force experienced by \scriptstyle. The vector \scriptstyle_2 is the force experienced by \scriptstyle. Their magnitudes will always be equal. The vector \scriptstyle_ is the displacement vector between two charges ( \scriptstyle and \scriptstyle). Electrostatic approximationIn either formulation, Coulomb's law is fully accurate only when the objects are stationary, and remains approximately correct only for slow movement. These conditions are collectively known as the electrostatic approximation. When movement takes place, magnetic fields are produced which alter the force on the two objects. The magnetic interaction between moving charges may be thought of as a manifestation of the force from the electrostatic field but with Einstein's theory of relativity taken into consideration.Table of derived quantitiesParticle propertyRelationshipField propertyVector quantityForce (on 1 by 2)\mathbf_= \mathbf_ \ |\mathbf_= q_1 \mathbf_||Electric field (at 1 by 2)\mathbf_= \mathbf_ \ |- |Relationship||\mathbf_=-\mathbfU_ || ||\mathbf_=-\mathbfV_ |- |Scalar quantity||Potential energy (at 1 by 2)U_= \ |U_=q_1 V_ \ ||Potential (at 1 by 2)V_= |See alsoBiot-Savart LawMethod of image chargesElectric fieldElectric constantCoulomb, the SI unit of electric charge named after Charles Augustin de CoulombElectromagnetic forceFootnotesReferencesExternal links[http://www.physnet.org/modules/pdfmodules/m114.pdf Coulomb's Law] on Project PHYSNET.Electricity and the Atom— - a chapter from an online textbookA maze game for teaching Coulomb's Law—a game created by the Molecular Workbench softwareCategory:Electrostatics Category:Introductory physics Category:Fundamental physics conceptsar:قانون كولوم bn:কুলম্বের সূত্র be:Закон Кулона be-x-old:Закон Кулёна ca:Llei de Coulomb cs:Coulombův zákon da:Coulombs lov de:Coulombsches Gesetz et:Coulombi seadus el:Νόμος του Κουλόμπ es:Ley de Coulomb fa:قانون کولن fr:Loi de Coulomb (électrostatique) gl:Lei de Coulomb ko:쿨롱의 법칙 is:Kúlombskraftur it:Forza di Coulomb he:חוק קולון hu:Coulomb-törvény ml:കൂളംബ് നിയമം nl:Wet van Coulomb ja:クーロンの法則 no:Coulombs lov pl:Prawo Coulomba pt:Lei de Coulomb ro:Legea lui Coulomb ru:Закон Кулона sk:Coulombov zákon sl:Coulombov zakon sr:Кулонов закон fi:Coulombin laki sv:Coulombs lag vi:Lực tĩnh điện tr:Coulomb yasası uk:Закон Кулона ur:قانون کولمب zh:库仑定律
