IUPAC is currently recommending the name actinoid rather than actinide, as the suffix "-ide" generally indicates ions (moreover, from Latin, the suffix -ide means "sons of actinium", while -oid means "similar to actinium"). There are alternative arrangements of the periodic table that exclude actinium or lawrencium from appearing together with the other actinoids.The actinoids display less similarity in their chemical properties than the lanthanoid series (Ln), exhibiting a wider range of oxidation states, which initially led to confusion as to whether actinium, thorium, and uranium should be considered d-block elements. All actinoids are radioactive.Only thorium and uranium occur naturally in the earth's crust in anything more than trace quantities. Neptunium and plutonium have been known to show up naturally in trace amounts in uranium ores as a result of decay or bombardment. The remaining actinoids were discovered in nuclear fallout, or were synthesized in particle colliders. The latter half of the series possess exceedingly short half-lives.The actinoids are typically placed below the main body of the periodic table (below the lanthanoid series), in the manner of a footnote. The full-width version of the periodic table shows the position of the actinoids more clearly.An organometallic compound of an actinoid is known as an organoactinoid.History of the actinoid seriesFrom the earlier known chemical properties of actinium (89) up to uranium (92), indicating a relation to the transition metals, it was generally assumed that the transuraniums would have similar qualities. During his Manhattan Project research in 1944, Glenn T. Seaborg experienced unexpected difficulty isolating americium (95) and curium (96). He began wondering if these elements more properly belonged to a different series than the transition metals, which would explain why the expected chemical properties of the new elements were different. In 1945, he went against the advice of colleagues and proposed the most significant change to Mendeleev's periodic table to have been accepted universally by the scientific community: the actinide series.In 1945, Seaborg published his actinide concept of heavy element electronic structure, predicting that the actinoids would form a transition series analogous to the rare earth series of lanthanoid elements.In 1961, Antoni Przybylski discovered a star that contained unusually high amounts of actinoids.See alsoActinides in the environmentReferencesExternal linksThe Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.Chemical Elements websiteLawrence Berkeley Laboratory image of historic periodic table by Seaborg showing actinide series for the first time[http://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_00.2.pdf#search=%22actinide%20series%22 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Uncovering the Secrets of the Actinides][http://arq.lanl.gov/ Los Alamos National Laboratory, Actinide Research Quarterly]  * Category:Chemical element groups Category:Periodic tableaf:Aktinied ar:أكتينيدات ast:Actínidu bs:Aktinoidi ca:Actínid cv:Актиноидсем cs:Aktinoidy da:Actinid de:Actinoide et:Aktinoidid el:Ακτινίδες es:Actínido eo:Aktinoido eu:Aktinoide fa:آکتینید fr:Actinide gl:Actínidos ko:악티늄족 hr:Aktinoidi id:Aktinida is:Aktiníð it:Attinoidi he:אקטיניד jv:Aktinida lt:Aktinoidai lmo:Attinid ml:ആക്റ്റിനൈഡുകള്‍ ms:Aktinida nl:Actinide ja:アクチノイド no:Aktinoider nn:Aktinid nds:Actinoid pl:Aktynowce pt:Actinídio ro:Actinide qu:Aktinyu rikch'aq q'illay ru:Актиноиды simple:Actinoid sk:Aktinoid sr:Актиноиди sh:Aktinoidi fi:Aktinoidi sv:Aktinoider th:แอกทิไนด์ vi:Nhóm Actini tr:Aktinit uk:Актиноїди zh-yue:錒系元素 zh:锕系元素
