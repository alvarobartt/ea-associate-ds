Art(h)ur Friedenreich (July 18, 1892 in São Paulo – September 6, 1969) was a Brazilian football player. Nicknamed The Tiger, he was one of the first black players in the previously white world of Brazilian football, and was arguably the sport's first black superstar. He was of mixed descent; his father Oscar Friedenreich emigrated from Germany to Brazil, and his mother Mathilde was an Afro-Brazilian.After playing with a succession of São Paulo club sides from 1910 onwards, Friedenreich made his debut with the national team in 1914. He played twenty-two internationals, including wins in the 1919 and 1922 editions of the Copa América, scoring ten goals. On Brazil's 1925 tour of Europe, he was feted as the King of Football. He also has a claim to the high scoring record but FIFA can't prove these goals because of faulty record-keeping. He wasn't picked up by Brazil National Football Team for World Cup 1930 because at age 38 he was already too old.Playing recordFriedenreich played for the following clubs:1909 SC Germania1910 Clube Atlético Ypiranga1911 SC Germania1912 Associacão Atlética Mackenzie College1913–1915 Clube Atlético Ypiranga1916 Clube Athletico Paulistano1917 Clube Atlético Ypiranga1918–1929 Clube Athletico Paulistano1930–1933 São Paulo Futebol Clube1933 Clube Atlético Mineiro1933–1935 São Paulo Futebol Clube1935 Clube de Regatas do FlamengoHe was top scorer of the Liga Paulista in the following years:1912 Club: Associação Atlética Mackenzie College 12 goals1914 Club: Clube Athletico Paulistano 12 goals1917 Club: Clube Atlético Ypiranga 15 goals1918 Club: Clube Athletico Paulistano 25 goals1919 Club: Clube Atlético Ypiranga 26 goals1921 Club: Clube Athletico Paulistano 33 goals1927 Club: Clube Athletico Paulistano 13 goals1928 Club: Clube Athletico Paulistano 29 goals1929 Club: Clube Athletico Paulistano 16 goalsBecause of the internal quarrels and the following splitting of the league in the LPF and APEA he had to share the top scorer title with the following players in the following years:1914 player: Neco, Club: Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, 12 goals1927 player: Araken, Club: Santos Futebol Clube, 31 goals1928 player: Heitor, Club: Palestra Itália - today's Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, 16 goals1929 player: Feitiço, Club: Santos Futebol Clube, 12 goalsHe retired while playing for Flamengo in 1935 at the age of 43 and died on September 6 1969, he was 77 years old. He played over 1200 games, scoring over 1200 goals, which according to some amateur sports statisticians would be comparable to the record of Pelé. The precise number of games and goals are not clear but some sources claim Friedenreich scored 1239 goals in 1329 games, and others that he scored 1329 goals in 1239 games. That these two numbers are identical save for the transposition of the second and third digits is a further source of confusion. See http://www2.bigsoccer.com/forum/showthread.php?t=218568.
