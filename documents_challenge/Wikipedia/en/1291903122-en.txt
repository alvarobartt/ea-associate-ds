September 10, 1943 in Milwaukee) is an American author of the series Conversations with God. The books so far in the series are Conversations With God (books 1-3), Friendship with God, Communion with God, The New Revelations, Tomorrow's God, What God Wants, Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends, and his newest book, Happier than God.BiographyWalsch was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 10, 1943, and brought up as a Roman Catholic by a family who encouraged his quest for spiritual truth. He studied The Bible, the Rig Veda and the Upanishads. He says his books are not channelled, but rather that they are inspired by God and that they can help a person relate to Him from a modern perspective. The God in his books, for example, says that "there is nothing you have to do." Walsch believes in a panentheistic God, who tries to communicate Himself as being unselfish. Walsch's vision is an expansion and unification of all present theologies to render them more relevant to our present day and time. He created Humanity's Team as a spiritual movement whose purpose is to communicate and implement his New Spirituality beliefs, particularly that we are all one with God and one with life, in a shared global state of being.Walsch has met with some criticism for what some see as appearing overly zealous in finding ways to make money for his spin-off organizations. He has also been met with much praise for what others see as a tremendous effort to help humankind.CareerBefore the Conversations With God series in the early 1990s, Walsch suffered a series of crushing blows — a fire that destroyed all of his belongings, the break-up of his marriage, a car accident that left him with a broken neck. Once recovered but alone and unemployed, Walsch was forced to live in a tent in Jackson Hot Springs, just outside Ashland, Oregon, collecting and recycling aluminium cans in order to eat. At the time, Walsch thought his life had come to an end. Despondent, Walsch began his writings after working his way out of homelessness following a short-lived job as a radio talk show host.In 2003, the film Indigo, written by Neale Donald Walsch and James Twyman and directed by Stephen Simon was released. It chronicled the fictional story of the redemption of a grandfather, played by Walsch, through his granddaughter, who is an indigo child.Conversations With God: The Movie opened in U.S. theaters Friday, October 27, 2006 and in Canada, November 10. The film was released on dvd February 27, 2007.BibliographyConversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1) (October 1, 1996)Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 2) (May 1, 1997)Meditations from Conversations With God, Book 2: A Personal Journal (December 1, 1997)The Little Soul and the Sun: A Children's Parable Adapted from Conversations With God (April 1, 1998)Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 3) (October 1, 1998)Neale Donald Walsch on Relationships (September 30, 1999)Neale Donald Walsch on Holistic Living (September 30, 1999)Neale Donald Walsch on Abundance and Right Livelihood (October 1, 1999)Friendship with God: An Uncommon Dialogue (October 1, 1999)Questions and Answers on Conversations With God (October 1, 1999)The Wedding Vows from Conversations With God (April 1, 2000)Recreating Your Self (June 1, 2000)Signals: An Inspiring Story of Life After Life (April 9, 2001) (by Joel Rothschild, foreword by Neale Donald Walsh)Moments of Grace (July 2001)Conversations With God for Teens (November 1, 2001)The New Revelations: A Conversation with God (September 30, 2002)Communion With God (October 1, 2002)Tomorrow's God: Our Greatest Spiritual Challenge (March 2, 2004)What God Wants: A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question (March 22, 2005)The Little Soul And The Earth: A Children's Parable Adapted From Conversations With God (August 1, 2005) (with Frank Riccio)The Complete Conversations with God (October 20, 2005)Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends (March 29, 2006)Happier Than God: Turn Ordinary Life into an Extraordinary Experience (February 29, 2008)External linksConversations with God WebsiteNealedonaldwalsch.comHumanity's Team Website - Founded by NealeNew Spirituality Website - Founded by NealeNeale Donald Walsch Biography at Bookbrowse.com Category:American spiritual writers Category:New Age authors Category:Religious culture of the Pacific Northwest Category:People from Milwaukee, Wisconsin Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ashland, Oregoncs:Neale Donald Walsch de:Neale Donald Walsch et:Neale Donald Walsch es:Neale Donald Walsch fr:Neale Donald Walsch hr:Neale Donald Walsch ja:ニール・ドナルド・ウォルシュ nl:Neale Donald Walsch pl:Neale Donald Walsch pt:Neale Donald Walsch ru:Уолш, Нил Доналд fi:Neale Donald Walsch sv:Neale Donald Walsch
