at behind right.]]The glockenspiel (German, "set of bells" or "play-bells", also known as orchestra bells and, in its portable form, bell lira or bell lyre) is a musical instrument in the percussion family. It is similar to the xylophone, in that it has tuned bars laid out in a fashion resembling a piano keyboard. The xylophone's bars are wooden, while the glockenspiel's are metal, thus making it a metallophone.In Germany, a carillon is also called a Glockenspiel.The glockenspiel, moreover, is much smaller and higher in pitch. When used in a marching or military band, the bars are sometimes mounted in a portable case and held vertically. In orchestral use, the bars are mounted horizontally. A pair of hard unwrapped mallets, made of rubber, plastic, or metal, are generally used to strike the bars, although if laid out horizontally, a keyboard may be attached to the instrument to allow chords to be more easily played.The glockenspiel's range is limited to the upper register, and usually covers about two and a half to three octaves. The glockenspiel is a transposing instrument; its parts are written two octaves below concert pitch. When struck, the bars give a very pure, bell-like sound.Glockenspiel in modern musicGlockenspiels are still quite popular and appear almost all genres of music. It is used in pop music, as well as hip hop, indie rock, jazz and world music.Artists using glockenspielGlockenspiel is used on some albums of the following artists:MetallicaThe BeatlesJimi Hendrix ExperienceBruce SpringsteenBeckRadioheadSigur RósRushLos Campesinos!Patrick WatsonSagapoolArcade FireCoheed and CambriaOneRepublicDetektivbyrånMotörheadGov't MuleOne classical piece where such an instrument is used is Mozart's Die Zauberflöte (although the part has most often been played with a celesta in modern times). A modern example of the glockenspiel is Steve Reich's 1974 composition Drumming, in which the glockenspiel becomes a major instrument in the 3rd and 4th movements.Other instruments which work on the same struck-bar principle as the glockenspiel include the marimba and the vibraphone. There are also many glockenspiel-like instruments in Indonesian gamelan ensembles.External linksGlockenspiel at the Vienna Symphonic LibraryRoyalschoolsources Percussion Pages Online sources for the prescribed music of the Royal Schools of Music practical examsCategory:Bells Category:Keyboard percussion Category:Struck idiophones Category:Marching percussion Category:Orchestral percussion Category:German loanwords Category:Pitched percussionbg:Глокеншпил cs:Zvonkohra de:Lyra (Glockenspiel) et:Kellamäng es:Glockenspiel eu:Glockenspiel fr:Glockenspiel gl:Glockenspiel it:Glockenspiel he:גלוקנשפיל nl:Glockenspiel ja:グロッケンシュピール no:Klokkespill pl:Dzwonki pt:Glockenspiel ru:Колокольчики simple:Glockenspiel sk:Zvonkohra fi:Kellopeli sv:Klockspel (slagverk) uk:Дзвіночки
