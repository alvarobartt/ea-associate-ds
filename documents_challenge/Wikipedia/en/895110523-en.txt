The former Indian town of Uyapari (today the town of Barrancas of Orinoco) was the centre of a splendid kind of pottery admired by some European explorers as Diego de Ordaz. Scholars, who studied this pottery, gave the culture which designed it the name of Barrancoide Culture.After a probable arrival of Columbus to the coast of Monagas State during his third voyage in August 1498 many explorations were done to this land. Some of the most famous Spanish explorers were Diego de Ordaz (discover of the Indian town of Uyapari), Diego de Lepe, Juan Bono de Quejo and Antonio Berrio. Apart from that, some hunters of Indians from the islands of Cubagua and Margarita sail around Monagas state looking for slaves in some Indians towns. The colonization of this state was very slow, for the resistance made by the Caribes. These Indians defended their freedom, families and lands against the Spanish conquerors who wanted to hunt and sell them to the encomenderos (persons who need slave for cultivating their farms).This situation began to change when Franciscan missioners arrived from Spain in order to evangelize the Indians. The Franciscans are the responsibles of the establishment of many missions which became in towns later. Some of these towns founded by the Franciscans are San Antonio (founded in 1710 by Gerónimo de Muros), Guanaguana (founded in 1729 by Pacián de San Martín), Caicara (founded in 1731 by Ambrosio de Blesa), Caripe (founded in 1734 by Pedro de Gelsa), Santa Bárbara (founded in 1754 by Casimiro de Borja), Maturín (founded in 1760 by Lucas de Zaragoza), Barrancas (founded in 1790 by Joaquín de Morata) and so on.However these foundations were not so easy. At the beginning some Indians, especially the Caribes, attacked the group of missioners. Some Franciscans died for the attacks, others passed away for the tropical sicknesses or for the rude conditions they were living. When the Caribes were driven out from the banks of Guarapiche River by the Spanish governor of Cumaná Pedro Carreño, the missioners were able to continue with the foundations of mission stations around Monagas State.The lands of Monagas were the scene of many battles during the fight for the independence of Venezuela. The most famous battles took place in Maturín.During the period of the republic, Monagas state had a slow growth because of the frequent civil wars which destroyed possessions and killed cattle and men. Another cause of this problem was the increment of deaths produced by tropical sicknesses as the yellow fever. The landscape change when oil fields were discovered in this land. The new petroleum activity stimulated industrial and commercial activities which attracted persons from other states and countries. Punta de Mata, El Tejero, Temblador are examples of towns which were born around the oil fields. Maturín became in an important commercial and banking centre in the east of Venezuela.In relation to the political formation of this entity, Monagas was part of the province of Nueva Andalucía, which became in the province of Cumaná, in the XVI, XVII, XVIII and the middle part of XIX centuries. In 1856 Monagas was raised to the level of province with the name of province of Maturín. In 1864 was ratified the new Maturín state. But in 1879 these lands lost their autonomy and formed part of the east state.In 1891 Monagas was added to the great Bermúdez state, which was composed by Sucre, Anzoátegui, Monagas, Bolívar states. Monagas got again the autonomy in 1901with the name of Maturín state. However Monagas lost this condition in 1904 when it was added to the Bermúdez state.At the end Monagas was separated from Barcelona state in 1909 and became a state with its current name.GeographyReliefThe state has many plateaus and savannas located in the southwest. In the northeast and the southeast there are deltaic savannas in which rivers such as San Juan, Guanipa, Caño Mánamo, Río Tigre flow into. In the northwest there is a group of mountains belonged to the eastern mountain range. This mountain range is divided in two massifs: the massif of el Turimiquire (in which the town of San Antonio is located) and the massif of Caripe (in which the town of Caripe is located).MountainsCerro Negro (2000 m.) is the highest mountain of Monagas State.WeatherThe weather is hot in the area of the Llanos, while it is cold in the mountains located in the north of the state. The average temperature in the low areas is between 25 and 28 °C. In the area of the town of Caripe the cold temperature permits the cultivation of certain kind of typical plants from cold weathers as roses and strawberries. The level of rainfalls in the state is between 530 and 1400 mm during the year.HydrologyThe rivers of the state belong to one of the two basins that are located in the state. The basins are the basin of Atlantic Ocean and the basin of the Orinoco River. Rivers such as Guanipa, Río Tigre, Morichal Largo, Caño Mánamo, Amana, Tonoro, Tabasca, Uracoa flow into the Orinoco River. On the other hand the rivers Guarapiche, San Juan, Río de Oro, Caripe flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The rivers of the Atlantic Ocean basin come from the mountains located in the northwest of the state and the rivers of the Orinoco river basin come from the many plateaus located in the southwest of Monagas State and from Anzoategui State.VegetationThe vegetation is the intertropical one. This vegetation is adapted to the different altitudes, weathers and kinds of soil of the state. Typical trees are el araguaney, la ceiba, el jobo, el aceituno, la vera, la palma de moriche and el mangle.Protected areasCueva del Guácharo National Park, was created on May 1975 by the Venezuelan government to protect the ecosystem surrounding the Guacharo’s Cave. The park has a surface area of 155 km² and covers the mountainous areas of Acosta and Caripe municipalities in Monagas state and Ribero municipality in Sucre state.Alejandro de Humboldt National Monument can be located inside the park El Guácharo. This national monument was created in 1949 to protect the Guacharo’s Cave. This national monument is named after the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the Guacharo’s cave in 1799.Another protected area is Guarapiche Forestal Reserve, which protects the forests located at the bank of Guarapiche and San Juan Rivers.PopulationThe population of Monagas state has been increased since the 20th decade of the last century as a consequence of exploitation of the oil fields located here.
