The company used the name Zagal for short. After the first democratic elections held in Croatia, Zagal changed its name on July 23 1990 to Croatia Airlines.In 1991 the airline signed an agreement with Adria Airways and then was able to lease a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 to start domestic jet services between Zagreb and Split. 1992 was a tough year for the company when the Serbo-Montenegrin aggression on Croatia forced the airline to stop flying. As soon as flights restarted, Croatia Airlines bought three Boeing 737s from Lufthansa and became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That year also saw the airline's first international route.In 1993 two ATR 42s and two more 737s joined the fleet, offices were opened in several European cities and the company bought a travel agency, Obzor, to organize travel for groups and individuals. By 1994, Croatia Airlines had welcomed its one millionth passenger. Later that year, Pope John Paul II flew the airline on a trip to Croatia.In 1995, another ATR 42 was welcomed, as was the two millionth passenger. In 1996, Croatia Airlines became the first airline to fly to Sarajevo. In 1997 the airline's first Airbus A320 arrived and was nicknamed Rijeka. In 1998, another first plane of a new type arrived when the airline's first Airbus A319 joined the fleet. This airplane was nicknamed Zadar. Also that year, Croatia Airlines became a member of the Association of European Airlines (AEA). By 1999, two more Airbus jets had arrived and Croatia Airlines started selling the Boeing part of their fleet. Another important event occurred when the airline flew its five millionth passenger.In 2000 two more Airbus planes arrived and an Automated Ticketing System was inaugurated. 2001 saw Croatia Airlines get maintenance and technical performing certificates from the German aviation authority Luftfahrt-Bundesamt. On November 18, 2004, Croatia Airlines joined the Star Alliance as a regional member, sponsored by Lufthansa. Croatia Airlines carried 1,715,027 passengers in 2007. According to some estimates 2007 was their best traffic year and also most profitable.Early 2008 saw the airline retire one of its three ATR 42 short-haul aircraft in anticipation for the delivery of replacement Bombardier Q400 aircraft, the first of which was delivered in May 2008. The airline is also believed to be interested in taking a stake in neighbouring airline BH Airlines with whom it presently codeshares.CH-Aviation - Airline News, Fleet Lists &amp; More&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Destinations]]Summer schedules for 2008 see the airline expand novosti&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; its destination network to: Podgorica, Priština, Düsseldorf and Copenhagen.Croatia Airlines serves the following destinations (as of May 2008):AustriaVienna (Vienna International Airport)BelgiumBrussels (Brussels Airport)Bosnia and HerzegovinaSarajevo (Sarajevo International Airport)CroatiaBol (Bol Airport)Dubrovnik (Dubrovnik Airport) Focus cityOsijek (Osijek Airport)Pula (Pula Airport)Rijeka (Rijeka Airport)Split (Split Airport) Focus cityZadar (Zadar Airport)Zagreb (Zagreb Airport) HubDenmarkCopenhagen (Copenhagen Airport)FranceParis (Charles de Gaulle International Airport)Lyon (Saint-Exupéry International Airport)GermanyDüsseldorf (Düsseldorf International Airport)Frankfurt (Frankfurt International Airport)Munich (Franz Josef Strauß International Airport)KosovoPristina (Pristina International Airport)ItalyRome (Leonardo da Vinci International Airport)IsraelTel Aviv (Ben Gurion International Airport)MacedoniaSkopje (Skopje Airport)MontenegroPodgorica (Podgorica Airport)NetherlandsAmsterdam (Amsterdam Schiphol Airport)SwitzerlandZürich (Zürich International Airport)United KingdomBelfast (Belfast International Airport)London(London Gatwick Airport)(London Heathrow Airport)Croatia Airlines also operates codeshare services to other destinations, primarily with Star Alliance partners.FleetThe Croatia Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft (at September 2008)Croatia Airlines Fleet:+ Croatia Airlines FleetAircraftTotalName and registrationPassengers(Business/Economy)RoutesNotesATR 42-300]]2Istra (9A-CTS), Dalmacija (9A-CTT)48(0/48)Short haul routesexit service in 2008, replaced with Dash 8Airbus A319-112]]4Zadar (9A-CTG), Zagreb (9A-CTH), Vukovar (9A-CTI), Pula (9A-CTL)132 (12/120)Short and medium haul routesAirbus A320-212, A320-214]]4Rijeka (9A-CTF)(212), Šibenik (9A-CTM)(212), Dubrovnik (9A-CTJ)(214), Split (9A-CTK) (214)164 (18/146)Short and medium haul routesDash 8 DHC-8 Q402]]2Slavonija (9A-CQA), Lika (9A-CQB)76 (0/76)Short haul routesanother 4 deliveries in 2009,  (4 options)Total:12As of 21 September 2008, the average age of the Croatia Airlines fleet is 10.8 years (http://www.airfleets.net/ageflotte/Croatia%20Airlines.htm).The airline is to acquire 6 (with options for 4 more) factory new 76-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft to boost its regional route network currently served with ATR 42 aircraft.http://www.bombardier.com/en/corporate/media-centre/press-releases/details?docID=0901260d8004c558&lt;/ref&gt; Delivery of the first aircraft registered 9A-CQA started in May 2008 and will continue in 2008 and 2009 with all aircraft on a 6 years finance leases.
