Number two in the vote was the Swedish national men's ice hockey team, which won Olympic gold and World Championships in 2006.Susanna and her twin sister Jenny have also done gymnastics and used to be members of the Swedish Junior National Team.CareerKallur made a breakthrough by winning the 100m hurdles at the 2000 World Junior Championship. She then initially failed to make an impact on senior competition, failing to make the final of two World Championships and then the 2004 Olympic Games. She did improve her personal best to 12.67s.In 2005 Susanna won her first senior gold medal at the 2005 European indoor Championships in Madrid. But once again she failed to reach the final of the World Championships in Helsinki. She came third in the 2006 World Indoor Championships.Kallur's biggest achievement to date was winning the 100m hurdles at the 2006 European Athletics Championships, in front of her home crowd in Gothenburg. She won in 12.59s ahead of Kirsten Bolm and Derval O'Rourke.Kallur retained her title at the 2007 European Indoor Championships.She finished only fourth in the 100m hurdles at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka despite running a personal best of 12.51s. However, the Swedish team had grounds for appeal, as eventual winner Michelle Perry had crossed over into Kallur's lane. Indeed they did register an appeal but after the time limit had elapsed. After the World Championships, Kallur won the three remaining Golden League events in Berlin, Zürich and Brussels, posting a personal best in the German capital and beating Perry in all three races.After posting several fast times throughout the beginning of the 2008 indoor season, Kallur broke the 60 m hurdles indoor world record, posting a time of 7.68 at a meeting in Karlsruhe, Germany on 10 February 2008. Kallur was then the clear favourite for the World Indoor title in Valencia and won her heat in 7.87 seconds, but did not start the semi-finals, pulling out injured.Susanna fell at the first hurdle of the 2nd semi-final of the 100m women's hurdle event at the 2008 Olympic Games.Best performances20052005 European Indoor Championships (Madrid)(60m Hurdles) Gold medal (7.80), making it a double win for the twins.20062006 World Indoor Championships (Moscow)(60m Hurdles) Bronze medal2006 European Championships (Göteborg)(100m Hurdles) Gold medal20072007 European Indoor Championships (Birmingham)(60m Hurdles) Gold medalPersonal bests60 metres: 7.24 secs (Birmingham, 3 March 2007)60 metres hurdles: 7.68 secs (Karlsruhe, 10 February 2008) World record100 metres: 11.30 secs (Malmö, 22 August 2006)100 metres hurdles: 12.49 secs (Berlin, 16 September 2007)200 metres: 23.32 (Gothenburg, 28 August 2005)800 metres: 2:27.87 (Huddinge, 6 September 1998)http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete%3D134743/ IAAF resultsNotes and references  External linksOfficial site Susanna Kallurfansite Susanna KallurSusanna Kallur's profile at Fightingillini.cstv.comSusanna Kallur Pictures Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Hurdlers Category:Sprinters Category:Swedish athletes Category:Olympic athletes of Sweden Category:Athletes at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Twin people Category:People from Long Island Category:University of Illinois alumnics:Susanna Kallur de:Susanna Kallur es:Susanna Kallur fr:Susanna Kallur it:Susanna Kallur nl:Susanna Kallur no:Susanna Kallur pl:Susanna Kallur ru:Каллур, Сюзанна sk:Susanna Kallurová fi:Susanna Kallur sv:Susanna Kallur
