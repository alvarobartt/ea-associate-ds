Islote de Lobos or Lobos Island Literally translating as "Wolf Islet", the name means rather "Islet of the Mediterranean Monk Seals". As there are no wolves in the Canaries, the largest local carnivore was colloquially referred to as lobo marinero ("sea wolf", compare sea-&quot;lion&quot;). Unfortunately, these animals are extinct in the Canaries, but should the species increase in numbers, Islote de Lobos could be re-colonized from the extant Desertas Islands population. is a small island of the Canary Islands located between the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. It has an area of 6 km². It has been nature reserve without permanent human population since 1982. The island is accessible to tourists via a short ferry ride from Fuerteventura, and it has day facilities and weekend homes of local fishermen. The local lighthouse was automated in 1968.In 1405, Islote de Lobos served as resupply base for Jean de Béthencourt's conquest of Fuerteventura.Gallery Image:Lobos Island lagoon.jpg|Lobos Island small lagoon Image:Lobos_Island_Playa_de_la_Concha.jpg|Lobos Island Playa de la Concha, looking to Punta Saladero Image:Lobos_Island_interior.jpg|Lobos Island interior Image:Lobos_Island_interior_detail.jpg|Lobos Island interior detail Image:Lobos_Island_desertification.jpg|Lobos Island desertification Image:Lobos.JPG|Lobos Island buildings ReferencesPott, Joachim; Hüppe, Joachim & de la Torre, Wofredo Wildpret (2003): Die Kanarischen Inseln.
