 .]]The Southern Hemisphere[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/southern%20hemisphere Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary] (based on Collegiate vol., 11th ed.) 2006. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Inc. is the half of a planet that is south of the equator—the word hemisphere literally means 'half ball'. It is also that half of the celestial sphere south of the celestial equator.Earth's southern hemisphere contains all or parts of four continents (Antarctica, Australia, most of South America, and parts of Africa), and four oceans (South Atlantic, Indian, South Pacific, and Southern). Several islands off the Asian continental mainland are also in the Southern Hemisphere. Due to the tilt of Earth's rotation relative to the Sun and the ecliptic plane, Summer is December 21 to March 21 and winter is June 21 to September 21.GeographyClimates in the southern hemisphere overall tend to be slightly milder than those in the northern hemisphere except in the Antarctic which is colder than the Arctic. This is because the southern hemisphere has significantly more ocean and less land. Water heats up and cools down more slowly than land. The southern hemisphere is also significantly less polluted than the northern hemisphere because of lower overall population densities (a total of 10 to 12% of the human population), lower levels of industrialisation, and smaller land masses (air currents run mostly west&ndash;east so pollution does not easily spread north or south). The tallest man-made structure in the Southern Hemisphere is the Woodside Omega Transmitter in Victoria, Australia.In the southern hemisphere the sun passes from east to west through the north, although north of the Tropic of Capricorn the mean sun can be directly overhead or due south at midday. The sun rotating through the north causes an apparent right-left trajectory through the sky unlike the left-right motion of the sun when seen from the northern hemisphere as it passes through the southern sky. Sun-cast shadows turn anticlockwise through the day (sun dials have the hours in reverse). Hurricanes and tropical storms spin clockwise in the southern hemisphere (as opposed to anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere) due to the Coriolis effect.The Moon appears the opposite way up to how it appears in the northern hemisphere.The southern temperate zone, a subsection of the southern hemisphere, is nearly all oceanic. The only countries that lie entirely within this zone are Uruguay, Lesotho, Swaziland and New Zealand. Countries lying partly in the zone are Chile (most of), Argentina (most of), Paraguay, Brazil, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa (most of), Mozambique, Madagascar and Australia.The south pole is oriented towards the galactic center and this, combined with clearer skies, makes for excellent viewing of the night sky from the southern hemisphere, with brighter and more numerous stars.List of continents and countriesContinentsthumb|right|A famous photo of Earth from [[Apollo 17 (Blue Marble) originally had the south pole at the top; however, it was turned upside-down to fit the traditional perspective.]]AntarcticaAfrica (approximately 1/3 of it - from south of Libreville in Gabon in the west to south of Somalia in the east)AustraliaSouth America (mostly, south of the Amazon river mouth in the east and Quito in the west)African countriesEntirelyAngolaBotswanaBurundiComorosLesothoMadagascarMalawiMauritiusMozambiqueNamibiaRwandaSeychellesSouth AfricaSwazilandTanzaniaZambiaZimbabweMostlyDemocratic Republic of CongoGabonRepublic of the CongoPartlyEquatorial GuineaKenyaSomaliaSão Tomé and PríncipeUgandaAsian countriesNote: The parts of these countries that are in the Southern Hemisphere are not part of the Asian continental mainland.EntirelyEast TimorMostlyIndonesiaPartlyMaldivesOceania countrieslocated in Auckland, New Zealand is the tallest free-standing structure in the Southern Hemisphere]]EntirelyAustraliaFijiNauruNew ZealandPapua New GuineaSamoaSolomon IslandsTongaTuvaluVanuatuMostlyKiribatiSouth American countriesEntirelyArgentinaBoliviaChileParaguayPeruUruguayMostlyBrazilEcuadorPartlyColombiaOther territoriesAmerican Samoa (USA)Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islandsBouvet Island (Norway)Chagos Archipelago (United Kingdom)Cook Islands (New Zealand)Easter Island (Chile)Falkland Islands (United Kingdom)French Polynesia(including Tahiti) (France)Galápagos Islands (Ecuador)Jarvis Island (USA)Juan Fernández Islands (Chile)Kerguelen Islands (France)Kermadec Islands (New Zealand)Mayotte (France)Territory of New Caledonia and Dependencies (France)New Zealand sub-antarctic islands (New Zealand)Niue (New Zealand)Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands (United Kingdom)Réunion (France)Saint Helena (United Kingdom)Saint Paul island and Amsterdam island (France)South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (United Kingdom, claimed by Argentina)South Orkney Islands (Antarctic Treaty signatories)Swains Island (USA, claimed by Tokelau)Tokelau (New Zealand)Tristan da Cunha (United Kingdom)Territory of Wallis and Futuna Islands (France)   appearing in the night sky of Swifts Creek, 100 km north of Lakes Entrance, Victoria, Australia]]  appearing from Stewart Island at the southern point of the South Island of New Zealand.]]See alsoNorthern HemisphereSeasonsSolsticeEquinoxTropic of CapricornCrux (or Southern Cross)ReferencesCategory:Hemispheresar:نصف كرة جنوبي ang:Sūðerne Healftrendel ast:Hemisferiu Sur bs:Južna hemisfera ca:Hemisferi sud cs:Jižní polokoule da:Sydlige halvkugle de:Südhalbkugel et:Lõunapoolkera el:Νότιο Ημισφαίριο es:Hemisferio Sur eo:Suda duonglobo eu:Hego Hemisferioa fa:نیم‌کره جنوبی fr:Hémisphère Sud gl:Hemisferio sur ko:남반구 hr:Južna polutka id:Belahan selatan is:Suðurhvel it:Emisfero australe he:חצי הכדור הדרומי ku:Nîvkada Başûr lv:Dienvidu puslode lb:Südhallefkugel lt:Pietų pusrutulis mr:दक्षिण गोलार्ध ms:Hemisfera Selatan nl:Zuidelijk halfrond nds-nl:Zujelijk halfroend ja:南半球 no:Sydlige halvkule nn:Den sørlege halvkula pl:Półkula południowa pt:Hemisfério sul ru:Южное полушарие simple:Southern Hemisphere sr:Јужна хемисфера sh:Južna hemisfera fi:Eteläinen pallonpuolisko sv:Södra halvklotet vi:Nam bán cầu tr:Güney Yarımküre uk:Південна півкуля ur:جنوبی نصف کرہ wuu:南半球 zh:南半球
