It flowers from March to May and grows between 15 and 40 cm in height. It has a round bulb, about 2cm in diameter which contains poisonous alkaloids.The plant is commonly found growing in grasslands in damp soils and river meadows. It can be found at altitudes up to 800 metres.It is native to Europe, but in many places, including France, Slovenia and Romania it is an endangered species that is rarely found in the wild, but is common in horticulturists' gardens. In Croatia the flower is known as Kockavica and is part of the country's national symbol. It is the only species of Fritillary native to Britain, growing in traditional grass meadows.
