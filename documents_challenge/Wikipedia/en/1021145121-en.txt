They have made one appearance at the World Cup finals, in 1974, but were beaten convincingly in the opening qualifying stages by three of the pre-tournament favorites; Italy, Poland, and Argentina. Their most recent achievement was in 2007, when the national team won the 2007 Caribbean Cup.HistoryHaiti has one of the longest football traditions in the Caribbean and was an early participant in World Cup qualifying. Throughout the 60s, and 70s, Haiti's footballing status in the region remained very strong, being considered the third strongest team in CONCACAF after Mexico and arguably Costa Rica. The Duvalier regime during the 70s ensured Haiti's qualification in regional and world competition through heavy political support as a method of improving the island's standing in sports. The strength of the national selection ultimately culminated in Haiti's first ever World Cup appearance in 1974, in which they surprised the world in their opening goal against a considerably stronger Italian team. The island nation has produced many talented star players over the years.The Golden AgeThe period from the mid-1960s to early 1980s could be considered a golden age for Haitian football. With Antoine Tessy as coach for much of this period, Haiti would emerge as one of the strongest teams in the CONCACAF zone, being pooled with other regionally strong football nations such as Mexico and arguably Costa Rica. By 1965, players like Henri Francillon, Philippe Vorbe and Guy St-Vil were already playing in the team and would be stalwarts of the side in the coming years.The team developed sufficiently to reach the final round of qualifying for 1970, where they faced El Salvador. After losing the first leg at home, Haiti pulled off a 3-0 win away but the rules of the day dictated a play-off on neutral ground which El Salvador won to secure a place in the 1970 FIFA World Cup.In the 1974 qualifiers, Haiti once again reached the final round in a qualifying tournament completely played at home. Haitian military rule of the time would make sure Haiti qualified at all costs. This time, with all odds on their favor, they would top the group and qualify for the 1974 World Cup. In West Germany, they would be drawn in an extremely tough group with Italy, Argentina and Poland. However, they surprised the football world in their debut game when star forward Emmanuel Sanon scored to give Haiti a lead over Italy, at the same time ending Dino Zoff's still standing record run of 1142 minutes without conceding a goal in international matches. They eventually lost 3-1, and would lose to Poland (7-0) and Argentina (4-1), but their brave display against Italy is forgotten by few.Haiti would reach the final rounds of 1978 and 1982 qualifiers, but failed to make the cut. The years since have seen Haiti's footballing status decline markedly. In recent years, the political situation in the country has led to numerous defections from members of the soccer team. The team has rebuilt somewhat through the Haitian diaspora in Miami, Florida, and some Haitian home games have been played in Miami in recent years. Last time Haiti played in Miami was on August 28 2007 against Club Atlético Boca Juniors. Haiti as of recently has been rising once again as a footballing power in CONCACAF.World Cup recordscoring against Dino Zoff in 1974 ]]1930 - Did not enter1934 - Did not qualify1938 - Did not enter1950 - Did not enter1954 - Did not qualify1958 to 1966 - Did not enter1970 - Did not qualify1974 - Round 11978 to 1986 - Did not qualify1990 - Did not enter1994 to 2006 - Did not qualifyCONCACAF Championship record1963 - Did not qualify1965 - 6th place1967 - 5th place1969 - Disqualified1971 - 2nd place1973 - Champions1977 -2nd place1981 - 6th place1985 -1sr round1989 - Did not enterGold Cup record1991 - Did not qualify1993 - Did not enter1996 - Did not enter1998 - Withdrew2000 - Round 12002 - Quarterfinals2003 - Did not qualify2005 - Did not qualify2007 - Round 1Current squadThe following players were called for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification against Suriname on August 20 2008.
