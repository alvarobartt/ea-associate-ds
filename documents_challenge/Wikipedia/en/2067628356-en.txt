It is named after the Portuguese playwright of the same name. The best season for the team was in 1999/2000, when it finished 5th in the Portuguese League.HistoryGil Vicente was founded in 3 May 1924, after the creation of other clubs in Barcelos, such as Barcellos Sporting Club and União Foot-ball Club Barcelense. The idea to found a new club came from a group of friends that every afternoon played football near the city's theater, named Gil Vicente, after the playwright. The initial name for the team was Gil Vicente Foot-ball Barcelense.The first struggles of the young team were mainly about finding a pitch to play. Back then, the team would play in the Campo da Estação, which belonged to another club, Triunfo Sport Club. On 3 May 1933, Gil Vicente played in its first field, Campo da Granja, with a capacity for 5012 spectators, and later renamed Adelino Ribeiro Novo, after a Gil Vicente goalkeeper who died there during a match on 16 September 1946.The team first got promoted to the top Portuguese division, then called First Division in 1990. In 1997, it got relegated to Liga de Honra and came back two years later by winning it. The best position was in the 1st year back in Superliga, when it finished 5th, led by manager Álvaro Magalhães, a former SL Benfica player and European Champion.Gil Vicente played in the "Estádio (stadium) Adelino Ribeiro Novo" until 2003/2004. From 2004/05 on, the team plays in the new Estádio Cidade de Barcelos. Estádio Adelino Ribeiro Novo is now used by the young squads of the club. The new stadium, with a capacity of 12374, belongs to the municipality and received two UEFA Under-21 European Championship 2006 matches: Serbia & Montenegro 0-1 Germany http://www.uefa.com/competitions/Under21/FixturesResults/Round=1912/match=83590/index.html and Portugal 0-2 Serbia & Montenegrohttp://www.uefa.com/competitions/Under21/FixturesResults/Round=1912/match=83595/index.html.Gil Vicente tried different colours in their kits. Initially, the shirts were red, then green and white with horizontal stripes. Later came yellow and red (colours of the town) and then blue. In the recent years, Gil Vicente alternates between red and blue.Recently Gil Vicente lost the right to participate in the 2006/2007 BWINLIGA to Belenenses as a result of the Mateus affair. Gil Vicente were accused by the special sports instances that rule Portuguese football of illegally resorting to regular courts on the dispute of Mateus, according to Gil Vicente, illegal contract with his former employer, FC Lixa. Still convinced this is not a sports-related case but rather work-related, Gil Vicente continues in courts. Along with the relegation, they were also suspended from the Cup of Portugal for one season. Two of the youth teams were also affected by this decision and won't play the respective championships this season. Currently, the professional team are playing the Liga de Honra while the club waits for a final decision from the court regarding the relegation.Current squad                          League and Cup HistoryThe club has 14 presences at the top level of Portuguese football.
