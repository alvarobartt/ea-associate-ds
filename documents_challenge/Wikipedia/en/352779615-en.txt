The Cable Guy is a 1996 black comedy film directed by Ben Stiller and starring Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick. The film also features Leslie Mann and Jack Black. The film was released in North America on Friday, June 14, 1996 by Columbia Pictures.PlotA TV-obsessed cable installer, who gives his name as Ernie "Chip" Douglas, installs Steven Kovacs's (Matthew Broderick) cable television service after Steven moves out of the apartment he shared with his girlfriend Robin (Leslie Mann). After he illegally gives Steven free pay channels, Chip believes he and Steven have struck up a friendship. Although Chip behaves in an off-putting manner, Steven comes to like his new pal. Chip shows his affection in odd ways, such as arranging a duel between the two, giving his new pal a (stolen) massive entertainment system, and paying a gorgeous prostitute to have sex with Steven. But not long passes before Chip's bizarre behavior exhausts Steven's patience, leading him to forcefully break off their friendship. Chip snaps, and resorts to stalking Steven and his girlfriend to get the attention he feels he deserves.The film satirizes America's obsession with television, and other forms of mass media such as the Internet and video games. Chip seems unable to separate fact from fiction, as television was his de facto parent. Director Ben Stiller has a minor role in the film as an accused murderer and former child star whose criminal case is constantly being talked about on every television station, with the signal being disrupted right before the verdict is announced.CastJim Carrey as Ernie "Chip" Douglas (The Cable Guy)Matthew Broderick as Steven M.

Well, maybe."See alsoCable televisionInternetReferencesThe ending seems to parody that of the movie Ricochet.External links  Category:1996 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:French-language films Category:Black comedy films Category:Comedy-drama films Category:Comedy thriller films Category:Films shot in Super 35de:Cable Guy – Die Nervensäge es:The Cable Guy fo:Kaðalmaðurin fr:Disjoncté hr:Nepodnošljivi gnjavator it:Il rompiscatole nl:The Cable Guy ja:ケーブルガイ pl:Telemaniak pt:The Cable Guy ru:Кабельщик (фильм) sr:Цревна напаст fi:Sähköputkimies sv:Cable Guy
