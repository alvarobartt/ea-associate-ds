The follow-up, 1996's Another Level (see 1996 in music) was a breakthrough success due to the top single "No Diggity" (with Dr. Dre), which was a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1996, and won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, along with the Top 40 hit "Don't Leave Me".
