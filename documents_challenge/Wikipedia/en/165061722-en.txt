   Campagnolo is an Italian manufacturer of bicycle components with headquarters in Vicenza, Italy, one of the most prestigious names in cycling. The components are organised as groupsets (gruppi) and are a near-complete collection of a bicycle's mechanical parts. Campagnolo's highest grade groups are Record (Super Record up to 1985), followed by Chorus.Founded by Tullio Campagnolo, the company began in 1933 in a small Vicenza workshop. The founder was an bicycle racer in Italy in the 1920s and he conceived several ideas while racing, such as the quick release mechanism for bicycle wheels, derailleurs, and the rod gear for gear changing. Gino Bartali made a strong impression as he won mountainous races while using this gear. Campagnolo has 135 patents. http://www.campyonly.com/history/timeline.htmlAt the end of the 1950s Campagnolo started to manufacture magnesium parts such as wheels for sports cars like Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Maserati, and also built chassis for NASA satellites in 1969. Campagnolo MilestonesCampagnolo worked closely with the famous racer Eddy Merckx, and produced special lightweight parts for his bike used to beat the world one hour record in 1972.Despite having lagged in innovations such as indexed gears, and combined brake and gear levers in the 1980s, Campagnolo introduced its Ergopower gears.The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Campagnolo start using carbon fibre parts in groupsets, and the development of wheelsets. In 2004 Campagnolo introduced a complete Compact drivetrain with smaller chainrings, to enable lower gears than traditional drivetrains. Campagnolo is developing electric shifting.Campagnolo has focused on road cycling and track cycling. Campagnolo's last foray into mountain-biking was the ill-fated Record-OR groupset. Campagnolo sponsors many teams in the UCI ProTour, such as Caisse d'Epargne, Cofidis, Quick Step-Innergetic (Tom Boonen, Paolo Bettini), and Lampre. Campagnolo is associated with the victories of Eddy Merckx, who used Campagnolo almost exclusively, and was friendly with Tullio Campagnolo.TrademarksCampagnolo has used various trademarks during its history, probably the best known is the name Campagnolo in a typeface as if handwritten, another well recognized trademark is a drawing of a hub quick release lever (Tullio's most famous innovation).Race ServiceFor many years Campagnolo has provided professional race mechanics with spare parts, and technical help at major races. Campagnolo relies on constant feedback from riders and race mechanics to improve and refine their products, so every design is well tested before going on sale to the general public.Campagnolo history and timeline  1901 Tullio Campagnolo is born on 26 August in the eastern suburbs of Vicenza, Italy1922 Tullio Campagnolo begins his racing career1930 Campagnolo patents the quick-release hub1933 After fabricating parts in the backroom of his father's hardware store, Tullio starts Campagnolo SPA with the production of the quick-release hub1940 Tullio hires his first fulltime employee.
