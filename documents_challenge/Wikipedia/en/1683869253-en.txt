  The ionization potential, ionization energy or EI of an atom or molecule is the energy required to remove an electron from the isolated atom or ion. More generally, the nth ionization energy is the energy required to strip it of the ''n''th electron after the first n-1 electrons have been removed. It is considered a measure of the "reluctance" of an atom or ion to surrender an electron, or the "strength" by which the electron is bound; the greater the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an electron. The ionization potential is an indicator of the reactivity of an element. Elements with a low ionization energy tend to be reducing agents and to form salts.Values and trendsMain article: Ionization energies of the elementsGenerally the n''-1st ionization energy is larger than the ''n''th ionization energy. The next ionization energy (the ''n-1st) involves removing an electron from an orbital closer to the nucleus. Electrons in the closer orbital experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction, and thus, require more energy to be removed.Some values for elements of the third period are given in the following table:kJ]]/mol (96.485 kJ/mol = 1 eV)''ElementFirstSecondThirdFourthFifthSixthSeventhNa4964,560Mg7361,4507,730Al5771,8162,88111,600Si7861,5773,2284,35416,100P1,0601,8902,9054,9506,27021,200S999.62,2603,3754,5656,9508,49027,107Cl1,2562,2953,8505,1606,5609,36011,000Ar1,5202,6653,9455,7707,2308,78012,000Large jumps in the successive ionization energies occur when passing noble gas configurations. For example, as can be seen in the table above, the first two ionization energies of magnesium (stripping the two 3s electrons from a magnesium atom) are much smaller than the third, which requires stripping off a 2p electron from the very stable neon configuration of Mg2+.Electrostatic explanationAtomic ionization energy can be predicted by an analysis using electrostatic potential and the Bohr model of the atom, as follows.Consider an electron of charge ''-e, and an ion with charge ''+ne, where n'' is the number of electrons missing from the ion. According to the Bohr model, if the electron were to approach and bind with the atom, it would come to rest at a certain radius ''a. The electrostatic potential V'' at distance ''a from the ionic nucleus, referenced to a point infinitely far away, is:V = \frac \frac \,\!Since the electron is negatively charged, it is drawn to this positive potential. (The value of this potential is called the ionization potential). The energy required for it to "climb out" and leave the atom is:E = eV = \frac \frac \,\!This analysis is incomplete, as it leaves the distance a as an unknown variable. It can be made more rigorous by assigning to each electron of every chemical element a characteristic distance, chosen so that this relation agrees with experimental data.It is possible to expand this model considerably by taking a semi-classical approach, in which momentum is quantized. This approach works very well for the hydrogen atom, which only has one electron. The magnitude of the angular momentum for a circular orbit is: L = |\mathbf r \times \mathbf p| = rmv = n\hbarThe total energy of the atom is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, that is: E = T + U = \frac - \frac = \frac - \fracVelocity can be eliminated from the kinetic energy term by setting the Coulomb attraction equal to the centripetal force, giving: T = \fracNow the energy can be found in terms of k'', ''e, and r. Using the new value for the kinetic energy in the total energy equation above, it is found that:E = - \fracSolving the angular momentum for v and substituting this into the expression for kinetic energy, we have:\frac = ke^2This establishes the dependence of the radius on n. That is:r(n) = \fracAt its smallest value, n'' is equal to 1 and ''r is the Bohr radius a0. Now, the equation for the energy can be established in terms of the Bohr radius. Doing so gives the result: E = - \frac \frac = - \fracThis can be expanded to larger nuclei by incorporating the atomic number into the equation. E = - \frac \frac = - \fraceVQuantum-mechanical explanationAccording to the more complete theory of quantum mechanics, the location of an electron is best described as a "cloud" of likely locations that ranges near and far from the nucleus, or in other words a probability distribution. The energy can be calculated by integrating over this cloud. The cloud's underlying mathematical representation is the wavefunction which is built from Slater determinants consisting of molecular spin orbitals. These are related by Pauli's exclusion principle to the antisymmetrized products of the atomic or molecular orbitals. This linear combination is called a configuration interaction expansion of the electronic wavefunction.In general, calculating the ''n''th ionization energy requires calculating the energies of Z-n+1 and Z-n electron systems. Calculating these energies is not simple, but is a well-studied problem and is routinely done in computational chemistry. At the lowest level of approximation, the ionization energy is provided by Koopmans' theorem.See alsoBragg-Gray Cavity TheoryElectronegativityIonizationThe ionization potential is equal to the ionization energy divided by the charge of an electron.The work function is the energy required to strip an electron from a solid.IonKoopmans' theoremDi-tungsten tetra(hpp) has the lowest recorded ionization energy for a stable chemical compound.Electron affinityExternal linksIonization Potentials of Common ChemicalsCategory:Ions Category:Molecular physics Category:Atomic physics Category:Chemical properties Category:Quantum chemistryaf:Ionisasie-energie ar:طاقة تأين an:Enerchía d'ionizazión ast:Enerxía d'ionización bs:Energija ionizacije bg:Йонизационна енергия ca:Energia d'ionització cs:Ionizační potenciál de:Ionisierungsenergie et:Ionisatsioonienergia es:Energía de ionización eu:Ionizazio-potentzial fa:انرژی یونش fr:Énergie d'ionisation gl:Enerxía de ionización ko:이온화 에너지 hr:Energija ionizacije it:Energia di ionizzazione lv:Jonizācijas potenciāls lb:Ioniséierungsenergie mk:Енергија на јонизација nl:Ionisatiepotentiaal ja:イオン化エネルギー uz:Ionlashish energiyasi pl:Potencjał jonizacyjny pt:Potencial de ionização ru:Энергия ионизации sk:Ionizačná energia sr:Енергија јонизације sh:Energija jonizacije fi:Ionisoitumisenergia sv:Jonisationspotential th:พลังงานไอออไนเซชัน vi:Năng lượng ion hóa tk:Baglanyşyk energiýasy ur:تائین توانائی zh:电离能
