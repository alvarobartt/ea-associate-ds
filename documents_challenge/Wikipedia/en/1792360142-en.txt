First professionally employed with Team Telekom in 2002, he was released the following year. In 2006, he made his UCI ProTour debut with Team Gerolsteiner after posting impressive continental circuits results on the UCI Europe Tour.Schumacher has been involved in a series of controversial incidents during his career. He was implicated in a doping case in 2005 when he tested positive for an amphetamine. His mother, a doctor, had prescribed an asthma medication after failing to find it on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances, and checking with the appropriate Dutch agency. He was cleared by the German cycling federation of a doping offence.In 2006 Schumacher, now riding for Team Gerolsteiner, won the Eneco Tour of Benelux by one second after colliding with his main rival George Hincapie in the closing metres of the final stage, when time bonuses were available for the leading finishers. Schumacher claimed he had collided first with a spectator and the race jury accepted his story.Following his third place in the 2007 world championships in his home town of Stuttgart, Schumacher was arrested for drunken driving. Four months later he revealed that the blood test taken at the time of his arrest had shown traces of amphetamines, whilst denying that he had knowingly taken drugs or had any knowledge of how the positive test had come about. Since a rule change in 2004 amphetamines were no longer on the WADA's out-of-competition banned list; as a result the German federation again exonerated him.Schumacher, riding as leader of Team Gerolsteiner, won both time trials in the 2008 Tour de France, beating Swiss favorite Fabian Cancellara, and took the yellow jersey of race leader after the first.On October 6, 2008, the media reported that Schumacher had tested positive for the controlled substance CERA (Continuous Erythropoiesis Receptor Activator), a new generation of EPO, in a blood sample taken during the 2008 Tour de France Piepoli and Schumacher Tour de France samples positive for CERA . CERA was also the drug for which Italian cyclists Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli tested positive during the Tour de France. Gerolsteiner are reported to have suspended Schumacher, and the German cycling federation is likely to take disciplinary action Tour rocked by new positive tests BBC News Monday, 6 October 2008Palmarès20021st, U23 Competition, Internationale Niedersachsen-Rundfahrt1st, U23 Competition, Peace Race20041st, Overall, Druivenkoers Overijse1st, Stage 6, Bayern-Rundfahrt20051st, Overall, Rheinland-Pfalz Rundfahrt (and Stage 1, 2, 3 and 4b wins)1st, Overall, Ster Elektrotour1st, Overall, Internationale Niedersachsen-Rundfahrt2nd, Overall, Rund um Köln2nd, Overall, Hel van het Mergelland20061st, Overall, Tour de Pologne (and Stage 6 & 7 win)1st, Overall, Eneco Tour of Benelux (and Prologue stage win)1st, Stages 3 and 18, Giro d'Italia (2 days in Maglia rosa General classification leader's jersey)1st, Overall, Circuit Cycliste Sarthe1st, Stage 4, Sachsen-Tour International20071st, Overall, Bayern Rundfahrt (and time trial stage win)1st, Amstel Gold Race4th Overall, Tirreno-Adriatico1st, Stage 5 (ITT)`2nd, Stage 43rd (Bronze), UCI Road World Championships - Men's Road Race200825th overall, Tour de France:1st, Stage 4 (ITT): Cholet - Cholet1st, Stage 20 (ITT): Cérilly - Saint-Amand-Montrond1st, General Classification after Stages 4 & 5Most Combative Rider for Stage 16ReferemcesExternal links Category:German cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:People from Baden-Württemberg Category:German Tour de France stage winners Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Germany Category:Doping cases in cyclingda:Stefan Schumacher de:Stefan Schumacher es:Stefan Schumacher fr:Stefan Schumacher gl:Stefan Schumacher it:Stefan Schumacher la:Stephanus Schumacher lb:Stefan Schumacher nl:Stefan Schumacher ja:シュテファン・シューマッハー no:Stefan Schumacher pl:Stefan Schumacher fi:Stefan Schumacher sv:Stefan Schumacher
