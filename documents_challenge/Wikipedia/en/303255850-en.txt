For the waltz composed by Johann Strauss, see Accelerationen.In kinematics, acceleration is defined as the first derivative of velocity with respect to time (that is, the rate of change of velocity), or equivalently as the second derivative of position. It is a vector quantity with dimension L&nbsp;T−2. In SI units, acceleration is measured in metres per second squared (m/s2).In common speech, the term acceleration is only used for an increase in speed (the magnitude of velocity); a decrease in speed is called deceleration. In physics, any increase or decrease in speed is referred to as acceleration, and also a change in the direction of velocity is an acceleration (the centripetal acceleration; whereas the rate of change of speed is the tangential acceleration).In classical mechanics, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the resultant (total) force acting on it (Newton's second law):\mathbf = m\mathbf \quad \to \quad \mathbf = \mathbf/mwhere F''' is the resultant force acting on the body, m is the mass of the body, and '''a is its acceleration.Tangential and centripetal accelerationThe acceleration of a particle can be written as:\mathbf = \fracvt \mathbf_\mathrm + \frac\mathbf_\mathrmwhere u'''t and '''un are (respectively) the unit tangent vector and the unit normal vector to the particle's trajectory, and R'' is its radius of curvature. These components are called the '''tangential acceleration' and the centripetal acceleration, respectively. Relation to relativityAfter completing his theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein realized that forces felt by objects undergoing constant proper acceleration are indistinguishable from those in a gravitational field. This was the basis for his development of general relativity, a relativistic theory of gravity. This is also the basis for the popular twin paradox, which asks why one twin ages less when moving away from his sibling at near light-speed and then returning, since the non-aging twin can say that it is the other twin that was moving. General relativity solved the "why does only one object feel accelerated?" problem which had plagued philosophers and scientists since Newton's time (and caused Newton to endorse absolute space). In special relativity, only inertial frames of reference (non-accelerated frames) can be used and are equivalent; general relativity considers all frames, even accelerated ones, to be equivalent. (The path from these considerations to the full theory of general relativity is traced in the introduction to general relativity.)See alsoUniform accelerationAngular accelerationCoordinate vs. physical accelerationDerivatives of positionEquations of MotionProper Acceleration0 to 60 mphShock (mechanics)External linksAcceleration and Free Fall - a chapter from an online textbook[http://physnet.org/home/modules/pdf_modules/m72.pdf Trajectories and Radius, Velocity, Acceleration] on Project PHYSNET (ERROR - PAGE MOVED)Science aid: MovementThe physics classroom Science.dirbix: AccelerationAcceleration CalculatorMotion Characteristics for Circular MotionPractical Guide to AccelerometersCategory:Motion Category:Physical quantities Category:Dynamicsaf:Versnelling ar:تسارع ast:Aceleración bn:ত্বরণ zh-min-nan:Ka-sok-tō͘ be:Паскарэнне be-x-old:Паскарэньне bs:Ubrzanje bg:Ускорение ca:Acceleració cs:Zrychlení cy:Cyflymiad da:Acceleration de:Beschleunigung et:Kiirendus el:Επιτάχυνση es:Aceleración eo:Akcelo eu:Azelerazio fa:شتاب fr:Accélération ga:Luasghéarú gv:Bieauaghey gl:Aceleración hak:Kâ-suk-thu ko:가속도 hr:Ubrzanje io:Acelero id:Percepatan is:Hröðun it:Accelerazione he:תאוצה ka:აჩქარება la:Acceleratio lv:Paātrinājums lt:Pagreitis hu:Gyorsulás ml:ത്വരണം ms:Pecutan mn:Хурдатгал nl:Versnelling (natuurkunde) ja:加速度 no:Akselerasjon nn:Akselerasjon nov:Akseleratione pl:Przyspieszenie pt:Aceleração ro:Acceleraţie qu:P'ikwachiy ru:Ускорение scn:Accilirazzioni simple:Acceleration sk:Zrýchlenie sl:Pospešek sr:Убрзање sh:Ubrzanje su:Akselerasi fi:Kiihtyvyys sv:Acceleration szl:Přispjyšyńy ta:முடுக்கம் te:త్వరణము th:ความเร่ง vi:Gia tốc tr:İvme uk:Прискорення zh-yue:加速度 zh:加速度
