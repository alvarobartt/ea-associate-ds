 The Opteron is AMD's x86 server processor line, and was the first processor to implement the AMD64 instruction set architecture (known generically as x86-64). It was released on April 22, 2003 with the SledgeHammer core (K8) and was intended to compete in the server market, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor. Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture (codenamed Barcelona) were announced on September 10, 2007 featuring a new quad-core configuration.Technical descriptionTwo key capabilitiesOpteron combines two important capabilities in a single processor die:native execution of legacy x86 32-bit applications without speed penaltiesnative execution of x86-64 64-bit applicationsThe first capability is notable because at the time of Opteron's introduction, the only other 64-bit processor architecture marketed with 32-bit x86 compatibility (Intel's Itanium) ran x86 legacy-applications only with significant speed degradation. The second capability, by itself, is less noteworthy, as all major RISC makers (Sun SPARC, DEC Alpha, HP PA-RISC, IBM POWER, SGI MIPS, etc.) have had 64-bit implementations for many years. In combining these two capabilities, however, the Opteron earned recognition for its ability to run the vast installed base of x86 applications economically, while simultaneously offering an upgrade-path to 64-bit computing.The Opteron processor possesses an integrated DDR SDRAM / DDR2 SDRAM (Socket AM2/F) memory controller. This both reduces the latency penalty for accessing the main RAM and eliminates the need for a separate northbridge chip.Multi-processor featuresIn multi-processor systems (more than one Opteron on a single motherboard), the CPUs communicate using the Direct Connect Architecture over high-speed HyperTransport links. Each CPU can access the main memory of another processor, transparent to the programmer. The Opteron approach to multi-processing is not the same as standard symmetric multiprocessing as instead of having one bank of memory for all CPUs, each CPU has its own memory. Thus the Opteron is a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture. The Opteron CPU directly supports up to an 8-way configuration, which can be found in mid-level servers. Enterprise-level servers use additional (and expensive) routing chips to support more than 8 CPUs per box.In a variety of computing benchmarks, the Opteron architecture has demonstrated better multi-processor scaling than the Intel Xeon. This is primarily because adding an additional Opteron processor increases bandwidth, while that is not always the case for Xeon systems, and the fact that the Opterons use a switched fabric, rather than a shared bus. In particular, the Opteron's integrated memory controller allows the CPU to access local RAM very quickly. In contrast, multiprocessor Xeon system CPUs share only two common buses for both processor-processor and processor-memory communication. As the number of CPUs increases in a Xeon system, contention for the shared bus causes computing efficiency to drop.Multi-core Opterons  In May 2005, AMD introduced its first "Multi-Core" Opteron CPUs. At the time, AMD's use of the term "Multi-Core" in practice meant "dual-core"; each physical Opteron chip contained two separate processor cores. This effectively doubled the computing-power available to each motherboard processor socket. One socket can now deliver the performance of two processors, two sockets can deliver the performance of four processors, and so on. Because motherboard costs increase dramatically as the number of CPU sockets increase, multicore CPUs enable a system of higher performance to be built at lower cost.AMD's model number scheme has changed somewhat in light of its new multicore lineup. At the time of its introduction, AMD's fastest multicore Opteron was the model 875, with two cores running at 2.2 GHz each. AMD's fastest single-core Opteron at this time was the model 252, with one core running at 2.6&nbsp;GHz. For multithreaded applications, the model 875 would be much faster than the model 252, but for single threaded applications the model 252 would perform faster.Second-Generation AMD Opteron processors are offered in three series: the 1000 Series (up to 1P/2-core), the 2000 Series (up to 2P/4-core), and the 8000 Series (4P/8-core to 8P/16-core). The 1000 Series is built on AMD's new Socket AM2. The 2000 Series and 8000 Series are built on AMD's new Socket F.AMD launched it's Third-Generation Quad-core Opteron chips on September 10th, 2007 [AMD Introduces the World’s Most Advanced x86 Processor, Designed for the Demanding DatacenterAMD to Ship Industry’s First Native x86 Quad-Core Processors In September]&lt;/ref&gt; with hardware vendors to follow suit with servers in the following month. Based on a core design codenamed ''Barcelona'', new power and thermal management techniques are planned for the chips. Existing dual core DDR2 based platforms will be upgradeable to quad core chips&lt;ref&gt;.Socket 939AMD has also released Socket 939 Opterons, reducing the cost of motherboards for low-end servers and workstations. Except for the fact they have 1 MiB L2 Cache (versus 512 KiB for the Athlon64) the Socket 939 Opterons are identical to the San Diego and Toledo core Athlon 64s, but are run at lower clockspeeds than the cores are capable of, making them more stable. They are also the only dual core Socket 939 processors still easily available now that the Athlon 64 X2s for that platform have been discontinued, though even these processors are becoming more and more difficult to find. http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_609,00.htmlSocket AM2 Socket AM2 Opterons are available for servers that only have a single-chip setup. These chips may prove to be as successful as the previous generation socket 939 Opterons due to the Opteron's overclockability. Codenamed Santa Ana, rev. F dual core AM2 Opterons feature 2&times;1 MiB L2 cache, unlike the majority of their Athlon 64 X2 cousins which feature 2x512 KiB L2 cache.Socket FSocket F (LGA 1207 contacts) is AMD’s second generation of Opteron socket. This socket support processors such as the Santa Rosa, Barcelona and Shanghai codenamed processors. The “''Lidded Land Grid Array''” socket adds support for DDR2 SDRAM and improved HyperTransport version 3 connectivity. Physically the socket and processor package are nearly identical, although not generally compatible with socket 1207 FXMicro-architecture updateThe Opteron line saw an update with the implementation of the AMD K10 microarchitecture. New processors, launched in the third quarter of 2007 (codename Barcelona), incorporate a variety of improvements, particularly in memory prefetching, speculative loads, SIMD execution and branch prediction, yielding an appreciable performance improvement over K8-based Opterons, within the same power envelope.In the meantime, AMD has also utilized a new scheme to characterize the power consumption of new processors under "average" daily usage, named Average CPU Power (ACP).ModelsFor Socket 940 and Socket 939 Opterons, each chip has a three-digit model number, in the form Opteron '''XYY. For Socket F and Socket AM2 Opterons, each chip has a four-digit model number, in the form ''Opteron '''XZYY. For all Opterons, the first digit (the '''X') specifies the number of CPUs on the target machine:1 - Designed for uniprocessor systems2 - Designed for dual-processor systems8 - Designed for systems with 4 or 8 processorsFor Socket F and Socket AM2 Opterons, the second digit (the Z''') represents the processor generation. Presently, only '''2 (dual-core, DDR2) and 3 (quad-core, DDR2) are used.For all Opterons, the last two digits in the model number (the YY) indicate the clock frequency of a CPU, a higher number indicating a higher clock frequency. This speed indication is comparable to processors of the same generation if they have the same amount of cores, single-cores and dual-cores have different indications despite sometimes having the same clock frequency.The suffix HE or EE indicates a high-efficiency/energy-efficiency model having a lower TDP than a standard Opteron. The suffix SE indicates a top-of-the-line model having a higher TDP than a standard Opteron.A detailed list of Opteron microprocessors is here.

Further, the server line of processors will incorporate the newly announced Bulldozer core with native 4 cores or more configurations on 32 nm process, each supporting SSE5 aimed at better HPC and cryptographic computations. Currently, Bulldozer-based pased products are expected to be released in 2011.See alsoList of AMD Opteron microprocessorsReferences and  tags and the tag below -- External linksOfficial Opteron homepageAMD Technical DocsOpteron Architecture Training Course by MindShareAMD K8 Opteron technical specificationsAMD K8 Dual Core Opteron technical specificationsInteractive AMD Opteron rating and product ID guideUnderstanding the Detailed Architecture of AMD's 64 bit Core28th Top 500 List (Nov 2006)Sun Microsystems Opteron Page (Dec 2006)AMD: dual-core Opteron to 3GHzCategory:Advanced Micro Devices x86 microprocessorsca:Opteron cs:Opteron da:Opteron de:AMD Opteron es:AMD Opteron fr:Opteron ko:옵테론 id:AMD Opteron it:Opteron hu:Opteron nl:Opteron ja:Opteron no:AMD Opteron pl:Opteron pt:Opteron ru:Opteron sk:Opteron fi:AMD Opteron sv:Opteron tr:Opteron uk:Opteron zh:Opteron
