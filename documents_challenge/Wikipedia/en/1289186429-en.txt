The flowers are similar to those of the snapdragon, 25-33 mm long, pale yellow except for the lower lip which is orange, borne in dense terminal racemes from mid summer to mid autumn. The fruit is a globose capsule 5-11 mm long and 5-7 mm broad, containing numerous small seeds.EcologyThe plant is widespread on ruderal spots, along roads, in dunes, and on disturbed and cultivated land.Because the flower is largely closed by its underlip, pollination requires strong insects such as bees and bumblebees (Bombus species).The plant is foodplant for a large number of insects such as the Sweet-Gale Moth (Acronicta euphorbiae), Mouse Moth (Amphipyra tragopoginis), Silver Y (Autographa gamma), Calophasia lunula, Gorgone Checkerspot (Charidryas gorgone carlota), Toadflax Pug (Eupithecia linariata), Satyr Pug (Eupithecia satyrata), Falseuncaria ruficiliana, Bog Fritillary (Boloria eunomia), Pyrrhia umbra, Brown Rustic (Rusina ferruginea), and ''Stenoptilia bipunctidactyla.Cultivation and usesWhile most commonly found as a weed, toadflax is sometimes cultivated for cut flowers, which are long-lasting in the vase. Like snapdragons (Antirrhinum), they are often grown in children's gardens for the "snapping" flowers which can be made to "talk" be squeezing them at the base of the corolla.Mabey, R. (1996). Flora Britannica. Sinclair-Stevenson ISBN 1-85619-377-2The plant requires ample drainage, but is otherwise adaptable to a variety of conditions.It has escaped from cultivation in North America where it is a common naturalised weed of roadsides and poor soils; it is listed as an invasive species in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces.Alberta Invasive Plants: Common Toadflax (pdf file)Nathaniel Lord Britton and Hon.
