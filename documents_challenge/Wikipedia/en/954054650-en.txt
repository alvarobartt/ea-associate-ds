Philippe Noiret (October 1, 1930 - November 23, 2006) was a French film actor.BiographyNoiret was born in Lille, northern France.He failed several times to pass his baccalauréat exams, so he decided to study theater. He trained at the Centre Dramatique de l'Ouest and toured with the Théâtre National Populaire for seven years. There, he met his wife Monique Chaumette, whom he married in 1962. At the same time, he developed a career as a nightclub comedian in a duo act with Jean-Pierre Darras.Noiret debuted on the screen in 1949 in an uncredited role in Gigi. In 1956 he appeared in La Pointe Courte directed by Agnès Varda. He was not cast again until 1960 in Zazie dans le métro. After his role in Thérèse Desqueyroux in 1962, he became a regular on the French screen, without being cast in major roles until La Vie de château directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau in 1966. He became a star in France with Alexandre le Bienheureux in 1967. At this point, he started to devote himself entirely to the screen.Noiret could not play romantic leads, so he was cast primarily as the Everyman character, although he did not hesitate to accept controversial roles, such as in La Grande Bouffe, a film about suicide by overeating, which caused a scandal at Cannes in 1973.Noiret won his first César Award for Vieux Fusil in 1976. His second César came in 1990 for La Vie et rien d'autre.Noiret is best known internationally for his role as Alfredo in Cinema Paradiso and the role of Pablo Neruda in Il Postino.Noiret died in Paris in 2006, aged 76, from cancer.AwardsCésar Award for Best Actor1976 - Le Vieux Fusil1990 - La Vie et rien d'autreFilmography (partial)TitleYearNotesGigi]]''1949Olivia]]''1950Agence matrimoniale]]''1952La Pointe courte1956Also known as The Short Point, with Agnès VardaZazie dans le métro]]''1960Also known as Zazie in the Metro or Zazie, directed by Louis MalleLe Capitaine Fracasse1961Thérèse Desqueyroux1962Comme un poisson dans l'eau1962English title: Like a Fish in the WaterLes Copains1964English title: The BuddiesLa Vie de château1965English title: Castle LifeTendre voyou1966Alexandre le bienheureux1967Night of the Generals1967Topaz]]''1969L'Étau, by Alfred HitchcockClérambard1969Played as Hector de ClérambardMr. Freedom1969Murphy's War1971La Mandarine1971La Grande Bouffe1973Played as PhilippeThe Clockmaker1974Amici miei1975Le vieux fusil1975Que la fête commence1975English title: Let Joy Reign SupremeUne Femme à sa Fenêtre1976English title: A Woman With Her WindowUn taxi mauve1977English title: The Purple TaxiTendre Poulet1977Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?1978Le Témoin]]''1978English title: The WitnessPile ou face1980On a volé la cuisse de Jupiter1980Tre fratelli]]''1981English title: Three BrothersL'étoile du nord]]''1982English title: North StarAmici Miei, Atto II1982Coup de Torchon1981Souvenirs souvenirs1984Les Ripoux1984Amici Miei, Atto III1985L'Eté prochain1985English title: The Next SummerLa Famille1986English title: The FamilyMasques]]''1987English title:MasksThe Return of the Musketeers1989Ripoux contre ripoux1989Nuovo Cinema Paradiso1989J'embrasse pas1991English title: I Do Not Kiss''Uranus1991Tango]]''1992Il Postino1994Max et JérémieEnglish title: Max and JérémieLa Fille de d'Artagnan1994English title: The Daughter of d'ArtagnanMarianna UcriaSoleil]]''1997English title: SunLe Pique-nique de Lulu Kreutz1999English title: The Picnic with Lulu KreutzLes Côtelettes2002English title: The ChopsPère et fils2002Ripoux 32003External links[http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1956662,00.html Guardian obituary][http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2470059,00.html Times obituary]  Category:1930 births Category:2006 deaths Category:BAFTA winners (people) Category:César Award winners Category:French film actors Category:French stage actors Category:People from Lille Category:Légion d'honneur recipients Category:Cancer deaths in Franceaf:Philippe Noiret br:Philippe Noiret bg:Филип Ноаре cs:Philippe Noiret da:Philippe Noiret de:Philippe Noiret el:Φιλίπ Νουαρέ es:Philippe Noiret eo:Philippe Noiret fa:فیلیپ نوآره fr:Philippe Noiret id:Philippe Noiret it:Philippe Noiret ka:ფილიპ ნუარე la:Philippus Noiret lb:Philippe Noiret hu:Philippe Noiret nl:Philippe Noiret ja:フィリップ・ノワレ no:Philippe Noiret pl:Philippe Noiret pt:Philippe Noiret ro:Philippe Noiret ru:Нуаре, Филипп scn:Philippe Noiret simple:Philippe Noiret sr:Филип Ноаре fi:Philippe Noiret sv:Philippe Noiret tr:Philippe Noiret
