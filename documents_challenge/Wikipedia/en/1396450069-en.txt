Roman historic records indicate activity of the Vulsini volcano occurred as recently as 104 BC, since when it has been dormant. The two islands in the southern part of the lake have been formed by underwater eruptions following the initial collapse of the caldera.The lake has an oval shape typical of crater lakes. Its total surface is 113.5 km²; the altitude of its surface is 305 m; it is 151 m deep at its lowest point and 81 m deep on average.The lake lies within the northern part of the province of Viterbo that is called Alto Lazio ("Upper Latium") or Tuscia. It is bordered mostly by the Roman consular road Via Cassia. Lake Bolsena has numerous tourist establishments, particularly for nature tourism, largely in the areas of camping, agrotourism and bed and breakfasts.The Romans called it Lacus Volsinii, adapting the Etruscan name, Velzna, of the last Etruscan city to hold out against Rome, which was so thoroughly eradicated after 264 BC, and its inhabitants translocated, that its site has not be securely identified.One third of the lake was donated to the Church by the noble family Alberici of Orvieto. In recognition of the generous donation the Alberici family was honored with a three times a year observance performed by the Bishop of Orvieto.Islands of the lakeBisentinaWith an area of 17 ha, Bisentina is the largest island, and it provides an interesting tourist excursion. One can reach the island via a ferry service provided from Capodimonte, available several times per day provided that a minimum number of passengers is reached. The price of the ticket includes a small excursion to the island Bisentina with a guided tour, to admire the almost unsullied nature, made of thick forests of evergreen oaks, Italian gardens, enchanting panoramas and numerous monuments like the church of Saint James and Saint Christopher with its cupola built by the architect Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola; the Franciscan convent; the precious Rocchina, a small temple dedicated to Saint Catherine in an octagonal floorplan by Antonio Sangallo, built on an Etruscan colombarium, erected on a rocky outcrop on the lake, or additionally the chapel of the Crucifix with its frescos of the fifth century, and to finish the horrible Malta dei Papi, prison for life for ecclesiastics found guilty of heresy, shaped from a small and dimly-lit cave, and slightly lit by a small trapdoor placed at a height of 20 meters.The excursion over, the boat makes a panoramic turn around the island, allowing one to see the delightful bays in the west, the majestic Mount Tabor in the north, the rocks hanging over the blue water of the lake in the east, and finally the green part on the southernmost bank towards the town of Capodimonte.The Etruscans and the Romans left few traces of their stay on the island. In the 9th century it provided refuge from the incursions of the Saracens.About 1250, it became the property of the lord of Bisenzio, who abandoned it and burned it following disagreements with the inhabitants of the island. In 1261, Urban IV, once elected pope, reconquered it; it was destroyed again in 1333 by Louis IV of Bavaria, accused of heresy and excommunicated by the pope. The property of the Farnese family from 1400 onwards, it had a period of great prosperity and was visited by many popes. In 1635, it was governed by Odoardo Farnese, duke of Castro, who entered into conflict with the Church, which resulted in the total destruction of Castro. The two islands returned to the Church's control and were soon ceded again. The princess Beatrice Spada Potenziani, wife of the duke Fieschi Ravaschieri, is the current owner.MartanaLocated opposite the town of Marta, the island of Martana is reputed to have once guarded the relics of Saint Christine to keep them from falling into the hands of the barbarians. Later, it is said that, during the dominion of the Goths, the Gothic queen Amalasuntha met a horrible death there. Her cousin Theodahad wished to seize power, and fomented a conspiracy to kill her at the hand of an assassin.The island is currently private property and no visitors are permitted.OutletMartaThe emissary Marta which leaves Lake Bolsena to the right of the community of Marta is a river which empties into the Tyrrhenian Sea.After passing through Marta, Tuscania and Tarquinia, it reaches the sea in the area of the lido of Tarquinia. There, in a magnificent region located between the mouth of Marta and that of Mignone, was created the natural reservoir "Saltworks of Tarquinia".''Comuni'' bordering the lakeThe following comuni are situated on the shore of Lake Bolsena:Bolsena, which gave its name to the lake, is famous for the miracle of Corpus Domini and for the plastic tables carried out by observers on the eve of the Festival of Saint Christine, patroness of the city.Montefiascone dominates the lake with its imposing monuments, such as Rocca and the cupola of Santa Margherita.
