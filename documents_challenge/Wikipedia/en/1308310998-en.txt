An Open Geospatial Consortium Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data dynamically from geographic information. This international standard defines a "map" to be a portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a computer screen. A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats. This is in contrast to a Web Feature Service (WFS), which returns actual vector data, and a Web Coverage Service (WCS), which returns actual raster data.This International Standard defines three operations:returns service-level metadatareturns a map with well-defined geographic and dimensional parametersreturns information about particular features shown on a map (optional)Web Map Service operations can be invoked using a standard web browser by submitting requests in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The content of such URLs depends on which operation is requested. In particular, when requesting a map the URL indicates what information is to be shown on the map, what portion of the earth is to be mapped, the desired coordinate reference system, and the output image width and height. When two or more maps are produced with the same geographic parameters and output size, the results can be accurately overlaid to produce a composite map. The use of image formats that support transparent backgrounds (e.g., GIF or PNG) allows underlying maps to be visible. Furthermore, individual maps can be requested from different servers. The Web Map Service thus enables the creation of a network of distributed map servers from which clients can build customized maps.A Web Map Service is usually not invoked directly. More often, it is invoked by a client application that provides the user with interactive controls. This client application may or may not be web-based.Some WMS ClientsThese mapping tools can act as WMS clients:ArcGIS DesktopArcGIS ExplorerArcGIS .NET and Java ADFGoogle EarthgvSIGNASA World WindOpenLayersOssimplanetuDigQgisDappleIDV_Solutions Visual Fusion ExperienceSome WMS ServersArcGIS ServerArcIMSGeoServerMapserverMapnikOracle MapViewerMapGuide Open SourceSuperMap IS.NetSuperMap IS JavaSuperMap iServerCARIS Spatial Fusion EnterpriseGeoMediaIDV_Solutions Visual Fusion ServerExternal linksOpenGIS® Web Map Service (WMS) Implementation Specification, Version 1.3.0, 2006-Mar-15, 06-042Visual catalog of WMS resourcesList of OGC WMS ServicesSpot (GPS and WMS-Client for mobile devices)Search and view public WMS server and layerOGC-Services.NET - Free List of OGC Services (New Services can be added manually)SUAS Mapserver (open source extended WMS-Server)GeoConnections WMS descriptionCategory:GIS software Category:Web Map Services Category:Open Geospatial Consortiumar:خدمة الخرائط الرقمية cs:Web Map Service de:Web Map Service es:Web Map Service fr:Web Map Service it:Web Map Service nl:Web Map Service no:Web Map Service pl:Web Map Service pt:Web Map Service
