He was a professional from 1988 to 2004 and dominated world cycling in the nineties.Museeuw is the winner of 11 World Cup races, including six victories in "Monument" events:Ronde van Vlaanderen 1993, 1995, 1998Paris-Roubaix 1996, 2000, 2002Züri-Metzgete 1991, 1995Paris-Tours 1993HEW Cyclassics 2002Amstel Gold Race 1994He won the World Cup in 1995 & 1996. He was also the Belgian Champion in 1992 & 1996.Museeuw won the World Cycling Championship in the road race in Lugano 1996. In that year, he also won the UCI Road World Cup, the only rider in history to accomplish both in the same year.Museeuw also won the following classics and semi-classics:Brabantse Pijl 1996, 1998, 2000Omloop &quot;Het Volk&quot; 2000, 2003E3 Prijs Vlaanderen 1992, 1998Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne 1994, 1997BiographyMuseeuw's father Eddy rode as a pro for two seasons without much success. Johan started his professional career in 1988 with ADR. In 1989 he was part of the ADR team in which Greg LeMond won his second Tour de France. In 1990 Museeuw went to the Lotto team for which he won two stages in the Tour de France that year. Later on he rode for the MG-GB, Mapei, Domo-Farm Frites and Quick-Step. He ended his career in the spring of 2004.Starting as a sprinter, Museeuw won the final stage of his first Tour de France in 1990. He subsequently traded his powerful sprint for more endurance and stamina that allowed him to win the spring classics such as Paris-Roubaix and the Ronde van Vlaanderen. While his attempt to set a new record by winning both races four times failed, he holds the record for the number of combined podium places in those races. He is often compared to other Flemish spring classics specialists such as Roger de Vlaeminck. He has a special friendship with current Quickstep team manager Patrick Lefevere (formerly of Mapei and Lotto-Domo) who admitted that he treats all his riders the same, but Museeuw has a special place in his heart.One week after winning the 1998 Ronde van Vlaanderen, Museeuw had a terrible fall in Paris-Roubaix (Bois de Wallers) in which his knee was shattered. On top of this came a dangerous infection which almost caused him to lose the injured leg. He fought back and resumed cycling after a long healing process. A couple of years later, he was again injured in a motor cycle accident. His dogged determination and powerful riding style won him legions of fans all over the world, but he is especially popular in his native Flanders, and was nicknamed Lion of Flanders. Upon crossing the finish line in victory in the 2000 Paris-Roubaix, he lifted his left foot and pointed at his knee as a reminder of the injury that almost ended his career two years earlier.Towards the end of his career, he acted as a mentor to Tom Boonen.In 2003 a doping allegation surfaced in which Museeuw was implicated. On 24 January 2007 Museeuw confessed to these charges.Museeuw confesses to have used doping (in Dutch language) Reports insinuated his using human growth hormone which he obtained from a Belgian vet Jose Landuyt. The police authorities claimed that Museeuw purchased banned substances and recorded phone conversations that spoke of wasps a codeword for Aranesp, a synthetic drug which increases red blood cell levels. Despite the absence of direct evidence, it was ruled in 2004 that there was sufficient argument for his suspension and he faces criminal proceedings. In his last Classic race the 2004 Paris-Roubaix he punctured while riding in the winning break, losing his last chance of equaling the record of four wins. He finished in tears in fifth place with his long-time rival Peter Van Petegem sixth. Johan's last race was the Grote Scheldeprijs held in his native Flanders on 14 April 2004. It was won by his team mate Tom Boonen. He "won" a tribute race on 2 May in his home town Gistel. Following his retirement he was suspended and he is not, in theory, allowed to work in cycling. However he could often be seen with the Quickstep team, in a PR function. More recently, Johan has begun marketing his own brand of frames made from a combination of carbon fibre and flax. http://www.museeuwbikes.be/In January 2007, Museeuw gave a press conference in Kortrijk, revealing that he had "not been completely honest in my last year as a pro, as I wanted to end my career in style", and announcing his resignation from Quickstep Innergetic.Victories1988Grote Prijs Briek Schotte, Desselgem1989GP Deutsche WeinstrasseCriterium OostendeCriterium Deerlijk5th stage Tour of Belgium19903d stage Driedaagse van De Panne1st stage Quatre Jours de Dunkerque1st stage Tour de l'Oise3d stage Tour of Ireland, Nissan Classic4th stage Tour de France21st stage Tour de FranceDwars door de MorbihanCriterium AalstCriterium DilsenCriterium ValkenswaardCriterium Lichtervelde19912nd stage Ruta Del Sol5th stage Ruta Del Sol5th stage Quatre Jours de Dunkerque3d stage Midi Libre2nd stage Tour of Britain3d stage Tour of Ireland, Nissan ClassicZüri-MetzgeteChampionship of FlandersCriterium De HaanCriterium DeerlijkCriterium Bavikhove19925th stage Vuelta a Andalucía1st stage Tour of Valencia2nd stage Tour of ValenciaE3-Prijs HarelbekeCriterium Bellegem1st stage Bicicleta Vasca2nd stage Ronde van de MijnvalleienCriterium PeerRoad Championship of Belgium1993GP Wielerrevue4th stage Paris-NiceDwars door België4th stage Hofbrau CupRonde van Vlaanderen1st stage Tour of SwitzerlandParis-ToursCriterium HengelooCriterium Bavikhove1994Kuurne-Brussels-KuurneAmstel Gold RaceCriterium MadeTeleport Derny AmsterdamWielsbeke8th stage Tour of SwitzerlandGeraardsbergenDruivenkoers Overijse1995Trofeo LaiguegliaOmloop de Vlaamse Ardennen, IchtegemRonde van Vlaanderen6th stage Quatre Jours de DunkerqueQuatre Jours de DunkerqueZüri-MetzgeteDruivenkoers OverijseGrand Prix Eddy MerckxChampionship of FlandersCriterium BavikhoveCriterium GrazUCI Road World Cup1996Brabantse PijlParis-RoubaixOmloop Mandel-Leie-Schelde1st stage Tour of PugliaRoad Championship of BelgiumWorld Cycling Championship, LuganoUCI Road World Cup1997Time trial Quatre Jours de DunkerqueQuatre Jours de Dunkerque2nd stage Ruta del Sol4th stage Ruta del Sol5th stage Ruta del SolKuurne-Brussels-KuurneCriterium PeerCriterium KortrijkGP Breitling (with Camenzind)Criterium KarlsruheGala Tour de France1998E3-prijs HarelbekeBrabantse PijlRonde van Vlaanderen1999Dwars door BelgiëOmloop Mandel-Leie-ScheldeCriterium BavikhoveGrand Prix Briek Schotte, Desselgem2000Paris-RoubaixOmloop "Het Volk"Brabantse Pijl2001Dernycriterium Wilrijk20021st stage Guldensporen TweedaagseParis-RoubaixProfronde van Made3d stage Tour du Région wallonneHEW Cyclassics HamburgProftour Almelo2003Omloop "Het Volk"3d stage Tour of Denmark   Laurent Jalabert | | title=Vélo d'Or | | after= Jan Ullrich | | years=1996   [[Abraham Olano]] |
