She died three years afterwards, and poisoning is suspected.On December 5, 1565, Alfonso married his second wife Barbara of Austria (April 30, 1539 - September 19, 1572), eighth daughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary.On February 24, 1579, Alfonso married his third wife Margherita Gonzaga (May 27, 1564 - January 6, 1618). She was the eldest daughter of William I, Duke of Mantua and Eleonora of Austria. Eleonora was an older sister of his second wife Barbara.He had no known children, legitimate or otherwise.SuccessionThe legitimate line ended in 1597 with him. Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor recognized as heir his cousin Cesare d'Este, member of a cadet branch, who continued to rule in the imperial duchies and carried on the family name. The succession, however, was recognized only by the Emperor but not by the Popes. In 1598 Ferrara was therefore incorporated into the Papal States by Pope Clement VIII, on grounds of doubtful legitimacy.Patron of the arts and sciencesAlfonso II raised the glory of Ferrara to its highest point, and was the patron of Torquato Tasso, Giovanni Battista Guarini, and Cesare Cremonini -- favouring the arts and sciences, as the princes of his house had always done. Luzzasco Luzzaschi served as his court organist.In addition, he was the sponsor of the Concerto delle donne, a type of group which was to be copied all over Italy. He also restored the Castello Estense, damaged by an earthquake in 1570.His expenses, however, went at damage of the public treasure.TriviaSome specialists claim that Alfonso II is the duke upon whom Robert Browning based his poem My Last Duchess.External linksIllustrious people    Category:1533 births Category:1597 deaths Category:People from Ferrara Alfonso 2 Category:Condottieri Category:Dukes of Ferrara Category:Dukes of Modena Category:Patrons of literature Category:16th century Italian peopleca:Alfons II d'Este de:Alfonso II. d’Este es:Alfonso II de Este fr:Alphonse II d'Este it:Alfonso II d'Este ka:ალფონსო II დ’ესტე nl:Alfonso II d'Este ja:アルフォンソ2世・デステ pl:Alfons II d'Este pt:Afonso II d'Este
