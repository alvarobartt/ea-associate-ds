  performing an historical demonstration]] Kingston, Ontario is a Canadian city located at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, where the lake runs into the St. Lawrence River and the Thousand Islands begin About The City Of Kingston.Kingston is the county seat of Frontenac County. According to the 2006 Canadian census, the population of the city proper was 117,207,Statistics Canada 2006 Census for the Kingston Metropolitan Area while the population of the metropolitan area was 152,358.Kingston is nicknamed the "Limestone City" because of the many historic buildings built from the local limestone.HistoryThe French originally settled upon a traditional Mississaugas First Nation site called Katerokwi (Cataraqui in the common transliteration, and according to French pronunciation rules should be said "kah-tah-RAH-kee," although it is generally pronounced "kah-tah-ROCK-way") in 1673 and established Fort Cataraqui, later to be called Fort Frontenac. The fort was captured and destroyed by the British in the Battle of Fort Frontenac during the Seven Years' War in 1758. A receiving centre for fleeing refugees from the American Revolution some years later, Kingston became the primary community of south-eastern Upper Canada.New settlement from the United Empire Loyalists (UEL) and Mohawks from the Six Nations in New York, led by Molly Brant (the sister of Six Nations Leader Joseph Brant - Tyendinega), formed a significant part of an expanding population in the area at the end of the 18th century.During the War of 1812, Kingston was the base for the Lake Ontario division of the Great Lakes British naval fleet which engaged in a vigorous arms race with the American fleet based at Sackett's Harbor, New York for control of Lake Ontario. After the war, Britain built Fort Henry and a series of distinctive Martello towers to guard the entrance to the Rideau Canal. All still exist, and Fort Henry is a popular tourist attraction. In 2007, the Rideau Canal and the fortifications at Kingston were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Kingston's location at the Rideau Canal entrance to Lake Ontario, after canal construction was completed in 1832, made it the primary military and economic centre of Upper Canada. Incorporated as a town in 1838, the first mayor of Kingston was Thomas Kirkpatrick. Kingston had the largest population of any centre in Upper Canada until the 1840s. Kingston was incorporated as a city in 1846.Kingston was chosen as the first capital of the united Canadas and served in that role from 1841 to 1844. The first meeting of the Parliament of the United Canadas on June 13, 1841 was held on the site of what is now Kingston General Hospital. The city was considered too small and lacking in amenities, however, and its location made it vulnerable to American attack. Consequently, the capital was moved to alternating locations in Montreal and Toronto, and then later to Ottawa in 1857. Subsequently, Kingston's growth slowed considerably and its national importance declined.Kingston was the home of Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald.During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Kingston remained an important Great Lakes port and a centre for shipbuilding and locomotive manufacturing, including the Canadian Locomotive Company, at one time the largest locomotive works in the British Empire. Most heavy industry has now left the city, and employment is now primarily in the institutional, military, and service/retail sectors.Kingston grew moderately through the 20th century through a series of annexations of lands in adjacent Kingston Township, including a 1951 annexation which encompassed areas west to the Little Cataraqui creek (including the village of Portsmouth) where a number of large residential subdivisions were built in the late 1950s and early '60s.Municipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding townships, which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and Pittsburgh Township to form a new City of Kingston. The city's boundaries now encompass large rural areas north of Highway 401 and east of the Cataraqui River.The term "Cataraqui", from the original native name for Kingston, today refers to an area around the intersection of Princess Street and Sydenham Road where a village that later took the name was located. Cataraqui is also the name of a municipal electoral district.Kingston's military historyKingston, being strategically located at the head of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River near the border with the United States, has been a site of vital military importance since Fort Frontenac was built in 1673. The French and British established military garrisons here, and several defensive fortifications were constructed. Military shipbuilding has also been a part of Kingston's history. Camp Barriefield, now McNaughton Barracks, was constructed at the beginning of the First World War and expanded during the Second World War. Camp Barriefield was named in honour of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Barrie (5 May 1774 – 7 June 1841), was a British naval officer noted for his service in the War of 1812. Vimy Barracks was established in 1937 for the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (later the Royal Canadian School of Signals). A military aerodrome was constructed to the west of Kingston to support flying training during the Second World War.Kingston's military units and facilities are supported by Canadian Forces Base Kingston (CFB Kingston). Vimy and McNaughton Barracks, which are located east of Kingston's downtown, today house the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics (CFSCE), the Canadian Forces' military communications training centre and several other units. Other establishments include Fort Frontenac located on the site of the original fort, and the Royal Military College of Canada located on Point Frederick.EconomyKingston's economy relies heavily on public sector institutions and establishments. The most important sectors are related to health care, education (Queen's University and Royal Military College), government (including the military and correctional services), tourism and culture, manufacturing, and research and development. One of Kingston's major industrial employers of the 20th century, the Canadian Locomotive Company, is long closed. The former Alcan and DuPont operations employ far fewer people than in the past.GeneralAccording to the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, in a 2007 report, the 20 largest employers in Kingston were: Canadian Forces Base Kingston 5,277Queen's University 4,200Kingston General Hospital 3,085Limestone District School Board 2,720Correctional Service of Canada 2,670StarTek 1,850City of Kingston 1,500Invista Canada (formerly DuPont): 1,100Hotel Dieu Hospital 1,000Providence Continuing Care Centre 1,000Royal Military College of Canada 780Ontario Ministry of Health 500Assurant Group 500Novelis (formerly Alcan) (Rolled Products and R&D Centre) 400Ontario Ministry of Transportation 400Empire Financial Group (subsidiary of Empire Life 400St. Lawrence College (Kingston Campus) 296Bell Canada 250DuPont Canada Inc. R & D Centre 200Can-coil 150Source: business.kingstoncanada.comTransportationHighway 401, which runs north of the city, is the principal access route into Kingston. The first sections of the highway in the Kingston area were opened in 1958, although it was not fully completed for another ten years. From the south, Interstate 81 connects with Highway 401 east of Kingston. Seasonal ferry service from Cape Vincent, New York, via Wolfe Island, into downtown Kingston is an alternate route to and from the United States.VIA Rail corridor service connects Kingston along the main line between Windsor and Quebec. By air, Kingston is served by Norman Rogers Airport with Air Canada providing regular service to Toronto only.Kingston Transit provides local municipal bus service.Culturein downtown Kingston]] Kingston has developed a thriving artistic and entertainment life. The city hosts several festivals during the year, including the Limestone City Blues Festival, the Kingston Canadian Film Festival, Fanfayr, the Kingston Buskers' Rendezvous, Kingston Jazz Festival, Reelout Film Festival and Feb Fest.Kingston is home to many artists who work in visual arts, media arts, literature, and a growing number who work in other time-based disciplines such as performance art. The contemporary arts scene in particular has two long standing professional non-profit venues in the downtown area, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre(founded 1957), and Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre (founded 1977). Local artists often participate in the exhibition programming of each organization, while each also presents the work of artists from across Canada and around the world - inkeeping with their educational mandates. Alternative venues for the presentation of exhibition programs in Kingston include The Union Gallery (Queen's University's student art gallery), Verb Gallery, Open Studio 22, the Kingston Arts Council gallery, and The Artel: Arts Accommodations and Venue.Writers who are or have been residents of Kingston include: Steve Heighton, Bronwen Wallace, Helen Humphreys, Joanne Page, Diane Schoemperlen, Eric Folsom, Michael Crummey, Melanie Dugan, Mary Alice Downie, Robertson Davies, Douglas Fetherling, Wayne Grady, Merilyn Simonds, Ellen Stafford, Alec Ross, Jamie Swift, Carolyn Smart and Alexander Scala.Music and theatre venues include the Grand Theatre (Kingston), Domino Theatre, Theatre Kingston and The Wellington Street Theatre, and other small groups that dot the downtown area. The Kingston Symphony Orchestra performs at The Grand Theatre, as do several amateur and semi-professional theatre groups.The city has spawned several musicians and musical groups, most of whom are known mainly within Canada, but a few of whom have achieved international success. These include John Kay, lead singer, harmonica player, and occasional guitarist of the heavy metal late 60s/early 70s band Steppenwolf, members of The Tragically Hip, The Mahones, jazz singer Andy Poole, Bedouin Soundclash, Sarah Harmer, The Arrogant Worms, The Headstones, The Inbreds, and David Usher, formerly of Moist.Kingston is also the birth place of Bryan Adams. Singer Avril Lavigne, from nearby Napanee, began her career after gaining notice singing at a Kingston fair and bookstore. The first winner of the television series Canadian Idol was Kingston native Ryan Malcolm.Poet Michael Andre was raised in Kingston, and actor Dan Aykroyd makes his home near Kingston.Educationwith downtown Kingston in the distance]] Kingston is the site of two universities, Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada, and a major community college, St. Lawrence College.Queen's UniversityQueen's University is one of Canada's oldest universities and offers a variety of degree programs.
