The people of the northern reaches had tired of the rigors of travelling all the way to Prescott for county business. They also believed that they were a significant enough entity that they should have their own county jurisdiction. Therefore, they decided in 1887 to petition for secession from Yavapai and the creation of a new Frisco County. They remained part of Yavapai, however, until 1891 when Coconino County was formed. The seat was at Flagstaff.GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 18,661&nbsp;square miles (48,332&nbsp;km²), of which, 18,617&nbsp;square miles (48,219&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 44&nbsp;square miles (113&nbsp;km²) of it (0.23%) is water.
