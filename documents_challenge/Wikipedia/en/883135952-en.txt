The Eos is Volkswagen's first production coupe since the last Corrado in 1995.The name Eos is derived from Eos, the Greek goddess of dawn and wind. &lt;/ref&gt;Roof designThe Eos incorporates into its five-piece folding roof an integrated and independently sliding glass sunroof &mdash; making the Eos the only retractable hardtop of this kind. The roof folds automatically into the trunk in 25 seconds, thereby reducing trunk space from 10.5 cubic feet to 6.6 cubic feet.The roof was designed by Murat Günak http://www.designophy.com/article.php?id=18, a Turkish designer &mdash; and is built by OASys, a subsidiary of Webasto Germany.Inception, production and historyPrior to production, the EOS was shown as the Concept C concept car at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show &mdash; designed by a team headed by Peter Schryer, Head of Volkswagen Design in Wolfsburg. &lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources attribute the design of the EOS specifically to Slovenian [[Robert Lešnik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lesnik&quot;/&gt;The production Eos was presented in September 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, with the North American introduction at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January, 2006.
