 ]] Pax Romana (Latin for "Roman peace") was the long period of relative peace and minimal expansion by military force experienced by the powerful Roman Empire in the first and second centuries AD. Since it was established by the Emperor Augustus it is sometimes called Pax Augustus. Its timing was approximately from 27 BC to 180 AD.The idea of Pax Romana was first presented by Edward Gibbon. Gibbon proposed a period of moderation'' and peace under Augustus and his successors and argued that generals bent on expansion'' (e.g. Germanicus, Agricola and Corbulo) were checked and recalled by the Emperors during their victories. Gibbon lists the Roman conquest of Britain under Claudius and the conquests of Trajan as exceptions to this policy of moderation and places the end of the period at the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD, despite the conclusion of peace by the latter's son Commodus later in the same year.Despite the term, the period was not without armed conflict, as Emperors frequently had to quell rebellions. Additionally, both border skirmishes and Roman wars of conquest happened during this period. Trajan embarked on a series of campaigns against the Parthians during his reign and Marcus Aurelius spent almost the entire last decade of his rule fighting against the Germanic tribes.Nonetheless, as the interior of the Empire remained largely untouched by warfare, the Pax Romana was an era of relative tranquility in which Rome endured neither major civil wars, such as the perpetual bloodshed of the third century AD, nor serious invasions, or killings, such as those of the Second Punic War three centuries prior. During this time, Roman commerce thrived, unhampered by piracy or marauding enemy troops.Given the prominence of the concept of Pax Romana, historians have coined variants of the term to describe systems of relative peace that have been established, attempted or argued to have existed, usually under the hegemony of one power or of an idea. These include Pax Americana, Pax Assyriaca, Pax Britannica, Pax Europeana, Pax Germanica, Pax Hispanica, Pax Minoica, Pax Mongolica, Pax Ottomana, Pax Sinica, and Pax Syriana.NotesExternal linkswww.unrv.com/early-empire/pax-romana.phpPax Romana Discussion groupCategory:Ancient Roman foreign relations Category:Ancient Rome by period Category:Roman Empire Category:Paxaf:Pax Romana ca:Pax romana ceb:Pax Romana cs:Pax Romana da:Pax romana de:Pax Romana et:Pax Romana es:Paz romana fr:Pax Romana ko:팍스 로마나 is:Pax Romana it:Pax romana he:השלום הרומאי la:Pax Romana nl:Pax Romana ja:パクス・ロマーナ no:Pax Romana pl:Pax Romana pt:Pax Romana ro:Pax Romana ru:Pax Romana scn:Pax Romana simple:Pax Romana fi:Pax Romana sv:Pax Romana tr:Pax Romana
