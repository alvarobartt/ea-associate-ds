The webmaster (feminine: webmistress), also called the web architect, the web developer, the site author, or the website administrator, is the person responsible for designing, developing, marketing, or maintaining a website. On community websites, webmasters are able to change and manipulate any comment that the users make.Webmaster as a professionWebmasters are practitioners of web communication. Typically, they are generalists with HTML expertise who manage all aspects of Web operations.On larger sites, the webmaster will act as a coordinator and overseer to the activities of other people working on the site and is usually an employee of the owner of the website, hence webmaster can also be listed as an occupation. If the webmaster is hired by a larger website, or promoted to the position, they could do things from web design, to project management, or employee supervision.In the early days of the use of the term "webmaster" (a take-off on the term "postmaster", the administrator of an e-mail system), this role encompassed all aspects of planning, coding, production, and user interface. The webmaster may have many of the duties of an information architect, including ensuring site usability, user experience and menu taxonomy.However, since the late 90s, this type of webmaster role was typically only found working on small Web sites that could be managed by one person, or in environments where there was not a great deal of role definition. The current model tends to be more team oriented with a website manager or online producer leading a team consisting of web developers, designers, programmers, QA lead, Adobe Flash developers and often at least one usability expert or a UI/UE team. In established web development companies, especially those existing since the 90s, the term webmaster may be used by senior officers of the company, and may include usage such as "Webmaster-in-chief."A broader definition of webmaster is a businessperson who uses online media to sell products and/or services. This broader definition of webmaster covers not just the technical aspects of overseeing Web site construction and maintenance but also management of content, advertising, marketing and order fulfillment for the Web site.Core responsibilities of the webmaster include the regulation and management of access rights of different users of a website, the appearance and setting up website navigation. Content placement can be part of a webmaster's responsibilities, while content creation is typically not.Typically, the webmaster is the agent who reads user feedback and complaints about site functionality.The webmaster is actually in charge of the server more so than the actual web pages. The web pages are handled by the senior designer.See alsoWeb designOnline producerReferences tags-- External linksInternational Webmasters AssociationWorld Organization of WebmastersNot-for-Profit Webmaster Round TableNational Association of Government WebmastersCategory:Computer occupations Category:Website managementar:سيد الويب bg:Уебмастър cy:Gwefeistr da:Webmaster de:Webmaster es:Webmaster fr:Webmestre gl:Webmaster it:Webmaster he:מנהל אתר אינטרנט ka:ვებ-მასტერი ku:Webmaster lv:Vietņvedis lmo:Master Sitee nl:Webmaster no:Webmaster pl:Webmaster pt:Webmaster ro:Webmaster ru:Веб-мастер scn:Webmaster fi:Webmaster sv:Webbansvarig tr:Webmaster zh:網站管理員
