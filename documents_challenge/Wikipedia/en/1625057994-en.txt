The Monsterican Dream is a 2004 album by Lordi. It is Lordi's worst selling album. The reason might be that many fans didn't like the album's more metallic music and scarier look. Mr. Lordi himself has said that the album isn't so much heavier than Get Heavy. The music just sounds heavy because of the style of mixing that was used. This could also be considered one of Lordi's darkest albums.Track listing"Theatrical Trailer" – 1:09"Bring It On (The Raging Hounds Return)" – 4:35"Blood Red Sandman" – 4:03"My Heaven Is Your Hell" – 3:41"Pet The Destroyer" – 3:50"The Children of the Night" – 3:44"Wake the Snake" – 3:46"Shotgun Divorce" – 4:42"Forsaken Fashion Dolls" – 3:43"Haunted Town" – 3:13"Fire In the Hole" – 3:27"Magistra Nocte" – 1:33"Kalmageddon" – 4:33"Blood Red Sandman" (bonus video track)SinglesMy Heaven Is Your HellBlood Red SandmanChartsChart (2004)PeakpositionFinland4 Category:2004 albums Category:Lordi albumsde:The Monsterican Dream et:The Monsterican Dream es:The Monsterican Dream fr:The Monsterican Dream hr:The Monsterican Dream it:The Monsterican Dream hu:The Monsterican Dream nl:The Monsterican Dream pl:The Monsterican Dream pt:The Monsterican Dream fi:The Monsterican Dream sv:The Monsterican Dream
