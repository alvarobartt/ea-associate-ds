The melody was composed by Peter Feit and the words are by Luang Saranuprapan. Phleng Chat (), literally meaning "national song", is a general word for national anthem. Phleng Chat Thai (), Thailand's national anthem, is also used to refer to this specific song.The anthem was composed a few days after the 1932 coup in the very similar tune to the national anthem of France, La Marseillaise, and was first broadcast in July 1932. The original lyrics were by Khun Wichitmatra.In 1934, Thai Government launched the competitions for the official national anthem, both with music and lyrics. For the music, Jangwang Tua Patayakosol composed another tune in a more traditional style called "Phleng Maha Nimit" for making the decision to the government but they still selected Phra Jenduriyang's melody because it sounded more modern. After that, in the competition for the lyrics with Phra Jenduriyang's music, the original words by Khun Wichitmatra won the first prize and still used as an official lyrics with, however, a minor edit and an additional version which wrote by Chan Khamvilai and won the second prize. ความเป็นมาของเพลงชาติไทยปัจจุบัน by Somsak Jiamthirasakul (in Thai language, from TU Journal, Years 27, Volume 1, December 2004) History of Thai National anthem from Banfun.com (in Thai language) History of Thai National anthem from Rakbankerd.com (in Thai language)In 1939, when the name of the country was changed from Siam to Thailand, a competition was launched to create new lyrics, with those by Luang Saranuprapan winning.
