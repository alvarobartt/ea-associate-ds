  is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūbu region of the island of Honshū. The capital is the city of Kōfu.HistoryPre-history to the 14th centuryPeople have been living in the Yamanashi area for about 30,000 years. As in most other Japanese regions, prehistoric society in Yamanashi progressed though the hunting, fishing and gathering stage of the Jōmon period, then the rice-producing stage of the Yayoi period and subsequent village and regional formation. The Maruyama and Choshizuka Kofun (earthen burial mounds) located on Sone Hill of Nakamichi Town　(currently in southern Kōfu) are believed to have been built from the end of the 4th century. From these remains it can be assumed that the people of Sone Hill had great influence.15th to 19th CenturiesAmong the many Kaigenji generations, those of the Takeda, Ogasawara, and Nanbu families were particularly prosperous. During the Sengoku period of the 16th century, Takeda Shingen attained the status of daimyō and built Tsuzuji Mansion and the Yōgai Castle in Kōfu. From this base, he attempted to unify and control Japan.After Takeda’s death in 1582, Kai-no-Kuni came under the control of the Oda and Toyotomi Clans before being subsumed into the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period. Beneath the Edo shogunate, the Kofu Clan (based in Kuninaka, or Central and Western Yamanashi) and the Yamura Clan (based in Gunnai, or Eastern Yamanashi) were formed, but in 1724 the area came under the direct control of the Shogunate. With the development of the Koshu Kaidō (highway) and Fuji River transport, goods, materials and culture flowed into the region.By the mid-19th century, the contradictions of military government and clan system caused stability to erode and resistance to erupt across Japan, paving the way for the Meiji Restoration of 1868.19th Century to the present dayAfter the Meiji government entered Kōfu Castle in 1868, the domain of the Kaifu government became Kai Prefecture, later renamed Yamanashi Prefecture on November 20, 1872 (November 20 is now celebrated as Prefectural Citizen’s Day in Yamanashi).In the early part of the Meiji period (1868–1911), industrial promotion policies furthered textile and wine making industries. In the late Meiji period, the Chūō Railway Line opened, also helping to develop local industry and culture.Agricultural production in farm towns was small and from the 1910’s through the 20’s there was much tenant strife. In 1926, the Minobu Railway Line opened, putting an end to Fuji River transportation.The capital city, Kōfu, suffered heavy bombing during World War II. In 1945, as part of governmental occupation reforms, agricultural land reforms increased the number of individual farms and introduced fruit farming to the region. Industry and commerce grew at rapid speed during the following periods, and the 1982 opening of the Chūō Expressway lead to a growth of third-sector industries that continues to this day.GeographyYamanashi Prefecture is bordered by Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Shizuoka, and Nagano. The prefecture is landlocked, with mountains surrounding the central Kōfu Basin. Mount Fuji is located on the southern border with Shizuoka. Mt. Fuji provides rain shadow effects, and as a result, the prefecture receives only about 818 mm of rainfall a year.CitiesTowns and Villages Towns and villages in each district:MergersEconomyYamanashi has a sizable industrial base in and around Kōfu city, with the jewelry and robotics industries being particularly prominent. The surrounding area is host to a number of farms and vineyards. Yamanashi is one of the major fruit producing regions in Japan, being the top domestic producer of grapes, peaches, plums, as well as wine. In addition, roughly 40% of the mineral water bottled in Japan comes from Yamanashi, mainly from around the Southern Alps, Mt. Fuji, and Mitsutōge areas.DemographicsYamanashi Prefecture has a sizable minority of Brazilians, approximately 15,000 people. The prefecture also contains a number of Nigerians and Indians.UniversitiesTsuru UniversityUniversity of YamanashiYamanashi Gakuin UniversitySportsThe sports teams listed below are based in Yamanashi.Football (soccer)Ventforet Kōfu (Kōfu)TrafficsRailway LinesEast Japan Railway CompanyChūō Main LineKoumi LineCentral Japan Railway CompanyMinobu LineFuji KyukoFuji Kyūkō LineTourismYamanashi is a popular destination for tourism. Mount Fuji, the Fuji Five Lakes region, the city of Kōfu, the nearby wineries, the fine temple Erin-ji, and the popular Kuonji Temple are a few of the most popular places to visit. The Fuji-Q Highland amusement park, with its newest roller coaster Eejanaika (roller coaster), is also popular.Eco-Tourism is another major attraction. The natural topography of the region makes Yamanashi a hiker's paradise. The tallest mountain in Japan, Mt. Fuji, and the second tallest mountain in Japan, Mount Kita, are both located within Yamanashi. Although not as tall, Mount Minobu offers stunning views if one joins the Buddhist pilgrims up to the summit of the mountain. Parts of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, and Minami Alps National Park are located in Yamanashi.Given the area's volcanic activity, natural hot springs, or onsens, are found in abundance. Some of the more famous are Isawa Onsen and Yamanami Onsen.MediaTelevisionYamanashi Broadcasting System(YBS)UHF Television Yamanashi(UTY)Prefectural symbolsSister states and regions Iowa, United States of America (since 1960) Minas Gerais, Brazil (since 1973) Sichuan Province, China (since 1985) Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea (since 1992) Saône-et-Loire, France (since 2000) Fairfield, California, United States of America (since 1970's)External linksOfficial Yamanashi Prefecture homepageOsano Memorial Foundation website, publishers of a biannual informative magazine about YamanashiYamanashi English Teachers International homepage (JET) Yamanashi Prefecture Category:Chūbu region Category:Prefectures of Japanar:ياماناشي (محافظة) bg:Яманаши cs:Prefektura Jamanaši de:Präfektur Yamanashi et:Yamanashi prefektuur es:Prefectura de Yamanashi eo:Jamanaŝi (prefektujo) fr:Préfecture de Yamanashi ko:야마나시 현 id:Prefektur Yamanashi it:Prefettura di Yamanashi ka:იამანასი lv:Jamanasi prefektūra lt:Jamanašio prefektūra hu:Jamanasi prefektúra nl:Yamanashi (prefectuur) ja:山梨県 km:ខេត្តយ៉ាម៉ាណាស៊ី pl:Prefektura Yamanashi pt:Yamanashi ro:Prefectura Yamanashi ru:Яманаси (префектура) sk:Jamanaši (prefektúra) sr:Префектура Јаманаши su:Préféktur Yamanashi fi:Yamanashin prefektuuri sv:Yamanashi prefektur tl:Prepekturang Yamagasyi th:จังหวัดยะมะนะชิ vi:Yamanashi tg:Префектураи Яманаши uk:Префектура Яманасі zh-yue:山梨縣 zh:山梨县
