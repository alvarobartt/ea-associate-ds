Hydrophile, from the Greek (hydros) "water" and φιλια (philia) "friendship," refers to a physical property of a molecule that can transiently bond with water (H2O) through hydrogen bonding. This is thermodynamically favorable, and makes these molecules soluble not only in water, but also in other polar solvents. There are hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the cell membrane.A hydrophilic molecule or portion of a molecule is one that is typically charge-polarized and capable of hydrogen bonding, enabling it to dissolve more readily in water than in oil or other hydrophobic solvents. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules are also known as polar molecules and nonpolar molecules, respectively. Some hydrophilic substances don't dissolve. This type of mixture is called a colloid. Soap has a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, which allows it to dissolve in both waters and oils, therefore allowing the soap to clean a surface.See alsoHydrophobeWettingSuper hydrophilicity  Category:Chemical properties Category:Intermolecular forcesar:محب للماء bs:Hidrofilnost da:Hydrofil de:Hydrophilie es:Hidrófilo eo:Hidrofila fr:Composé hydrophile ko:친수성 it:Idrofilia he:הידרופיליות ka:ჰიდროფილი lt:Hidrofiliškumas nl:Hydrofiel no:Hydrofil pl:Hydrofilowość pt:Hidrofilia ro:Hidrofilie ru:Гидрофильность sl:Hidrofilnost fi:Hydrofiilinen sv:Hydrofil tr:Hidrofil uk:Гідрофільність zh:親水性
