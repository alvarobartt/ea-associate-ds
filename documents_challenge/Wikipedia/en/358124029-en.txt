and Labrador]] Labrador Sea (French: mer du Labrador) (60°00'N, 55°00'W) is an arm of the North Atlantic Ocean between Labrador and Greenland.Water depths in the center of Labrador Sea are around  and it is flanked by continental shelves to the southwest, northwest, and northeast. It connects to the north with Baffin Bay through the Davis Strait.The Labrador Sea probably formed by sea-floor spreading that started around 61 million years ago and stopped about 40 million years ago. There is an earlier history of basin formation on all margins.During the ice age, the North American ice sheet repeatedly collapsed sending armadas of icebergs into Labrador Sea. Rocks that melted from the icebergs today form a layer of drop stones (glacial erratics) on the bottom of Labrador Sea.One of the world's largest turbidite channels runs N-S in the middle of Labrador Sea. Turbidite avalanches run down this channel for many hundreds of kilometers, many of them ending in very deep water off New England.The Labrador Sea is the source of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a cold, highly saline water that forms in the Labrador Sea and flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic, spreading out to form the largest identifiable water mass in the World Ocean.ReferencesCategory:Labrador Sea Category:Oceanography Category:Plate tectonics Category:Seas of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Baffin Bay-   be:Мора Лабрадор cs:Labradorské moře de:Labradorsee et:Labradori meri es:Mar de Labrador fr:Mer du Labrador ko:래브라도 해 id:Laut Labrador it:Mare del Labrador lv:Labradoras jūra lt:Labradoro jūra mn:Лабрадорын тэнгис nl:Labradorzee ja:ラブラドル海 no:Labradorsjøen pl:Morze Labradorskie pt:Mar do Labrador ru:Море Лабрадор sv:Labradorhavet tr:Labrador Denizi uk:Море Лабрадор zh:拉布拉多海
