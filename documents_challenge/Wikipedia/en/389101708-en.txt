The conspicuous presence of hills and rugged terrain has added to a especial leaning towards hiking, nature and mountains on the part of Gipuzkoans. Some mountains steeped in tradition hold an iconic and emblematic significance, their summits being often topped with crosses, memorials and mountaineer postboxes. In addition, pilgrimages (which have gradually lost their former religious zeal and taken on a more secular slant) are sometimes held to their summits. Some renown and iconic mountains to mention but a few are Aiako Harria, Hernio, Txindoki, Aizkorri, Izarraitz, etc.Gipuzkera is a dialect of the Basque language spoken in most of the region as well as neighbouring areas of Navarre, which shows a considerable vitality and holds a prominent position among other dialects. The province's patron saints are Ignatius of Loyola, who was born in the neighborhood of Loyola in the town of Azpeitia, and Our Lady of Arantzazu.See List of municipalities in Guipúzcoa.External links Official site (Information in Basque, Spanish, French and English)  Category:Gipuzkoa Category:Provinces of Spainaf:Gipuzkoa ar:غيبوثكوا an:Guipuzcua ast:Guipúzcoa br:Gipuzkoa ca:Guipúscoa cs:Guipúzcoa da:Gipuzkoa de:Gipuzkoa et:Gipuzkoa es:Guipúzcoa eo:Gipusko eu:Gipuzkoa fa:گیپوسکوا (استان) fr:Guipuscoa gl:Provincia de Guipúscoa - Gipuzkoa hr:Gipuzkoa it:Guipúzcoa pam:Guipúzcoa lad:Provinsia de Guipozkoa la:Ipuscoa lb:Guipúzcoa nl:Gipuzkoa ja:ギプスコア県 no:Gipuzkoa oc:Guipuscoa pl:Gipuzkoa pt:Guipúscoa ro:Provincia Guipúzcoa ru:Гипускоа fi:Guipúzcoa sv:Guipúzcoa tr:Guipuzcoa vec:Gipuzkoa war:Guipúzcoa zh:吉普斯夸省
