 Paris quadrifolia (Herb Paris, True-lover's Knot) is a species of the genus Paris in the family Melanthiaceae although authorities formerly regarded it as part of the Liliaceae family. It is related to Trillium with which it can be confused. Trillium however is generally 3-merous (3 leaves per whorl, 3 petals etc.) whereas Paris is 4-merous.CharacteristicsIn the UK it has the familiar name of Herb Paris.It has solitary flowers with four or more very narrow greenish filiform (threadlike) petals and green petaloid sepals. The flower is borne above a single whorl of four or more stem leaves. It prefers calcareous soils and lives in damp and shady places especially old established woods and stream sides. It occurs locally in temperate and cool areas throughout Europe and Asia but is absent in the wild from the Americas, Africa and the southern hemisphere. In Britain it is more frequently found in the east of the country but it is uncommon throughout its range. Each plant only produces one, blueberry-like fruit, which is poisonous.Herb Paris gallery Image:Little Sorn burnside.JPG|Typical Herb Paris woodland habitat in Ayrshire, Scotland.
