Before 2005 the club's home ground was Vetch Field.History Nicknamed "The Swans" or "The Jacks", the club played from its formation in 1912 (as Swansea Town) until 2005 at the Vetch Field(1912-2005) in Swansea city centre. In the summer of 2005 Swansea City moved to a new council owned 20,532 all seater ground, the Liberty Stadium.Surprisingly, the early 1980s were Swansea's most successful years, under the guidance of then player-Manager, Cardiff born John Toshack, the Swans gained promotion to the old First Division in 1981, winning 3 consecutive Welsh Cups and subsequently appearing in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup as well. In thier first season in the top flight they beat the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and unlucky not to beat Liverpool at Anfield. Two months before threre first season in top flight football ended they were top for the league but finished 6th by may. As fast as Swansea rose up the Football League, a decline ensued just as quickly.In recent years the club has brought itself up from the decline of the 80's and 90's and has re-established itself as a credible force in the football league. They were promoted to League One as 3rd in 2004-2005 and League Championship as champions in 2007-2008. 2008-09 will be Swansea's first season at this level since 1983-84. With this, they are in contention with rivals Cardiff City for a Welsh place in the English Premiership.The manager at the time of the first triumph was Kenny Jackett but he departed in 2007 to be succeeded by Roberto Martinez, who guided them to title glory a year later and then to beat Cardiff City in the League Cup in the next September.HonoursFootball LeagueLeague One (third tier) champions 2007-2008Third Division (South) champions 1924-25, 1948-49Third Division (fourth tier) champions 1999-2000FA Cup semi-finalists 1926, 1964Football League Trophy winners 1994, 2006Welsh CupWinners 1913, 1950, 1961, 1966, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1989, 1991FAW Premier CupWinners 2005, 2006FAW Welsh Youth CupWinners 1999, 2003, 2008Runners-Up 1990, 1991, 1994, 1996, 2004West Wales Senior CupWinners 1923, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1930, 1934, 1949, 1950, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, 1975, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1994, 1995, 2002, 2003Welsh Football LeagueDivision One champions 1913, 1925, 1926, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1951, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1976League Cup winners 1931, 1933Football CombinationReserve Division Two champions 1955, 1961(Reserve) Cup winners 1947, 1950Macbar (Reserve) CupWinners 1987Southern Football League(Reserves) Western Section champions 1925Club recordsBiggest win 12-0 v Sliema Wanderers (Malta), European Cup Winners' Cup First Round First Leg, 15 September 1982Biggest win (League) 8-0 v Hartlepool, Football League Fourth Division, 1 April 1978Biggest defeat 0-8 v Liverpool, FA Cup 3rd Round Replay, 9 January 1990; 0-8 v Monaco (France), European Cup Winners' Cup First Round Second Leg, 1 October 1991Biggest defeat (League) 1-8 v Fulham, Football League Second Division, 22 January 1938Highest attendance (Vetch Field) 32,786 v Arsenal, FA Cup Fifth Round, 17 February 1968Highest attendance (Liberty Stadium) 19,288 v Yeovil, Football League One, 11 November 2005Lowest attendance (Vetch Field) 1,301 v Northampton Town, Football League Fourth Division, 18 September 1973Lowest attendance (Liberty Stadium) 5,321 v Rushden and Diamonds, Football League Trophy Second Round, 22 November 2005Highest final position 2nd (Division One), 1941/42Lowest final position 22nd (Division Four), 1974/75Most points in one season 92 (in League 1) 2007/2008PlayersCurrent squadAs of 7 October 2008.                           For recent transfers, see List of English football transfers 2007-08.Out on loan        Notable former playersFour Swansea-born men were named among the Football League's 100 legends, to mark the 100th season of League football in 1998. All four began their careers with the club. They were Ivor Allchurch, John Charles (signed by Leeds before making his first-team debut), Trevor Ford and Cliff Jones.Ivor Allchurch is the subject of the first statue to be placed at the Liberty Stadium. Funded by the club's Supporters' Trust, it was unveiled in October 2005 and stands outside the ticket office. Following a poll conducted by the BBC programme Football Focus, Allchurch was named Swansea City's 'Cult Hero', beating off competition from Alan Curtis and Robbie James.Many of Swansea's greatest players were part of the squad that, between 1978 and 1981, won promotion from the old Fourth Division to the old First Division under John Toshack, who now manages the Welsh national team. These included goalkeeper Dai Davies, fans' favourite Alan Curtis, the late Robbie James, winger Leighton James, Yugoslavian international defenders Ante Rajkovic and Dzemal Hadziabdic (now coach of the Qatari national team) and Nigel Stevenson.More recent players include long-serving goalkeeper Roger Freestone, whose Swansea career came to an end in 2004 just a handful of games short of the club appearance record, and Merseyside born Lee Trundle who, after scoring 85 goals in 183 appearances during 4 years at The Swans, moved to Championship Side Bristol City for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £1,000,000Chelsea and England Midfielder Frank Lampard had a spell on loan from West Ham in the 1995-1996 season playing 11 games and scored 1 goal for the Swans before heading back to Upton ParkGiorgio Chinaglia was born in Italy but grew up in Cardiff and made 6 appearances for Swansea before playing in Italy and the USA, becoming NASL's top scorer of all-time.Gentle Giant ImmortalisedOn May 5 2007 a permanent memorial to John Charles, one of Swansea's favourite footballing sons, was unveiled at the Liberty Stadium. Regarded by many as the greatest all-round footballer ever to come from Britain,&lt;/ref&gt; Charles never played a professional game for Swansea, despite playing for the club as a boy, making his name with Leeds United and Juventus, where he acquired the nickname Il Gigante Buono – The Gentle Giant.Other notable former players''See also Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
