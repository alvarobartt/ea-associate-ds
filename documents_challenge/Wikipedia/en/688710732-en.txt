Its ISO 4217 code is "LYD". The dinar is subdivided into 1000 dirham (درهم). It was introduced in 1971 and replaced the pound at par. It is issued by the Central Bank of Libya, which also supervises the banking system and regulates credit. In 1972, the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank was established to deal with overseas investment.CoinsUntil 1975, old coins denominated in milliemes (equal to the dirham) circulated. In 1975, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dirham which bore the coat of arms of the Federation of Arab Republics. These were followed in 1979 by a second series of coins, in the same denominations, which bore a design of a horseman in place of the arms. ¼ and ½ dinar coins were issued in 2004. http://www.cbl.gov.ly/en/variant/index.php?cid=100&amp;id=474 1, 5, 10, and 20 dirham coins are rarely used, if ever, as units of exchange. However, they still retain their status as legal tenders.BanknotesBanknotes in denominations of ¼, ½, 1, 5 and 10 dinar were introduced in 1971. 20 dinar notes were added in 2002.

The official name dinar is rarely used outside official circles. The official fractional unit dirham is never used in everyday talk. Garsh - a variant of the word qirsh - is used instead, with 1 garsh = 10 dirhams. One thousand dinars is stylishly called a kilo . Similarly, five dinars notes and ten dinars notes are sometimes nicknamed, in younger generations male slang, faifa  and tsena  respectively, which are playful feminizations of the English words five and ten. Libyan currency is nicknamed by Libyans ʿOmar El-Mokhtar after the Libyan freedom fighter who is featured on the obverse of the 10 dinar note.ReferencesSee alsoEconomy of LibyaExternal links       Category:Economy of Libyaar:دينار ليبي be-x-old:Лібійскі дынар ca:Dinar libi cs:Libyjský dinár cy:Dinar Libya da:Libysk dinar de:Libyscher Dinar el:Δηνάριο Λιβύης es:Dinar libio fr:Dinar libyen ko:리비아 디나르 hr:Libijski dinar bpy:লিবিয়ান দিনার id:Dinar Libya it:Dinaro libico lt:Libijos dinaras hu:Líbiai dinár nl:Libische dinar nn:Libysk dinar pl:Dinar libijski ru:Ливийский динар sv:Libysk dinar tg:Динори Либия tr:Libya Dinarı bat-smg:Lėbėjės dinars zh:利比亞第納爾
