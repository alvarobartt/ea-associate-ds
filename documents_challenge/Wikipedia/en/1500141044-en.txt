It was released on August 16, 1989. Mother's Milk peaked at number 52 on Billboard Top 200 album chart. It has sold one million copies and has been certified platinum.BackgroundBefore the album was recorded, guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a speedball overdose on June 25, 1988 and drummer Jack Irons left soon after. After temporarily employing former P-Funk guitarist DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight and Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro, guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith were chosen to replace them. Originally the album was planned as The Rockin' Freakapotamus, but after Slovak's death the recordings were stopped. Now "The Rockin' Freakapotamus" is the name of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' fan club.Recording and productionFrontman Anthony Kiedis noted in his autobiography that Frusciante and producer Michael Beinhorn often fought over the former's guitar work. Frusciante preferred a more dry sound as he would employ on later records. Beinhorn, however, preferred the standard practice of layering guitar tracks. Frusciante went with Beinhorn's suggestions, and because of this, much of the album's guitar work sounds notably different from the other albums that feature Frusciante. "Pretty Little Ditty" is a notable exception.Track listingAll songs written by Red Hot Chili Peppers, except where noted."Good Time Boys" – 5:02"Higher Ground" (Stevie Wonder) – 3:23"Subway to Venus" – 4:25"Magic Johnson" – 2:57"Nobody Weird Like Me" – 3:50"Knock Me Down" – 3:45"Taste the Pain" – 4:32"Stone Cold Bush" – 3:06 (Frusciante, Kiedis, Flea, Smith, D.
