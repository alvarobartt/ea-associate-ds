quartz crystal enclosed in a hermetically sealed HC-49/US package, used as the resonator in a crystal oscillator.]] A crystal oscillator is an electronic circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time (as in quartz wristwatches), to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters/receivers.History]]The traditional and most common type of piezoelectric resonator used in electronics was the quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits designed around them were called 'crystal oscillators'. Piezoelectricity was discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. Paul Langevin first investigated quartz resonators for use in sonar during World War I. The first crystal controlled oscillator, using a crystal of Rochelle salt, was built in 1917 and patented, filed April 10, 1918, granted August 27, 1940 in 1918 by Alexander M. Nicholson at Bell Telephone Laboratories, although his priority was disputed by Walter Guyton Cady.&lt;/ref&gt; Cady built the first quartz crystal oscillator in 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early innovators in quartz crystal oscillators include G. W. Pierce and Louis Essen.Quartz crystal oscillators were developed for high-stability frequency references during the 1920's and 1930's. By 1926 quartz crystals were used to control the frequency of radio broadcasting stations and were popular with amateur radio operators.  http://www.ieee-uffc.org/fc_history/bottom.html A History of the Quartz Crystal Industry in the USA, Virgil E. Bottom, from the Proceedings of the 35th Annual Frequency Control Symposium 1981, retrieved June 19,2008  A number of firms started producing quartz crystals for electronic use during this time. Using what are now considered primitive methods, about 100,000 crystal units were produced in the United States during 1939. During WW2, demand for accurate frequency control of military radio equipment spurred rapid development of the crystal manufacturing industry. Suitable quartz became a critical war material, with much of it imported from Brazil.Although crystal oscillators still most commonly use quartz crystals, devices using other materials are becoming more common, such as ceramic resonators.OperationA crystal is a solid in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions.Almost any object made of an elastic material could be used like a crystal, with appropriate transducers, since all objects have natural resonant frequencies of vibration. For example, steel is very elastic and has a high speed of sound. It was often used in mechanical filters before quartz. The resonant frequency depends on size, shape, elasticity, and the speed of sound in the material. High-frequency crystals are typically cut in the shape of a simple, rectangular plate. Low-frequency crystals, such as those used in digital watches, are typically cut in the shape of a tuning fork. For applications not needing very precise timing, a low-cost ceramic resonator is often used in place of a quartz crystal.When a crystal of quartz is properly cut and mounted, it can be made to distort in an electric field by applying a voltage to an electrode near or on the crystal. This property is known as piezoelectricity. When the field is removed, the quartz will generate an electric field as it returns to its previous shape, and this can generate a voltage. The result is that a quartz crystal behaves like a circuit composed of an inductor, capacitor and resistor, with a precise resonant frequency. (See RLC circuit.)Quartz has the further advantage that its elastic constants and its size change in such a way that the frequency dependence on temperature can be very low. The specific characteristics will depend on the mode of vibration and the angle at which the quartz is cut (relative to its crystallographic axes)1 Therefore, the resonant frequency of the plate, which depends on its size, will not change much, either. This means that a quartz clock, filter or oscillator will remain accurate. For critical applications the quartz oscillator is mounted in a temperature-controlled container, called a crystal oven, and can also be mounted on shock absorbers to prevent perturbation by external mechanical vibrations.Quartz timing crystals are manufactured for frequencies from a few tens of kilohertz to tens of megahertz. More than two billion (2&times;109) crystals are manufactured annually. Most are small devices for consumer devices such as wristwatches, clocks, radios, computers, and cellphones. Quartz crystals are also found inside test and measurement equipment, such as counters, signal generators, and oscilloscopes.ModelingElectrical modelfor a piezoelectric crystal resonator]]  A quartz crystal can be modelled as an electrical network with a low impedance (series) and a high impedance (parallel) resonance point spaced closely together. Mathematically (using the Laplace transform) the impedance of this network can be written as:Z(s) = \left( +s\cdot L_1+R_1 \right) || \left(  \right) or,Z(s) = \frac + ^2 + ^2 \Rightarrow \omega_s = \frac, \quad \omega_p = \sqrt = \omega_s \sqrt \approx \omega_s \left(1 + \frac\right) \quad (C_0  C_1) where s is the complex frequency (s=j\omega), \omega_s is the series resonant frequency in radians per second and \omega_p is the parallel resonant frequency in radians per second.Adding additional capacitance across a crystal will cause the parallel resonance to shift downward. This can be used to adjust the frequency at which a crystal oscillator oscillates. Crystal manufacturers normally cut and trim their crystals to have a specified resonant frequency with a known 'load' capacitance added to the crystal. For example, a 6 pF 32&nbsp;kHz crystal has a parallel resonance frequency of 32,768&nbsp;Hz when a 6.0 pF capacitor is placed across the crystal. Without this capacitance, the resonance frequency is higher than 32,768&nbsp;Hz.Resonance modesA quartz crystal provides both series and parallel resonance. The series resonance is a few kilohertz lower than the parallel one. Crystals below 30&nbsp;MHz are generally operated between series and parallel resonance, which means that the crystal appears as an inductive reactance in operation. Any additional circuit capacitance will thus pull the frequency down. For a parallel resonance crystal to operate at its specified frequency, the electronic circuit has to provide a total parallel capacitance as specified by the crystal manufacturer.Crystals above 30&nbsp;MHz (up to 200&nbsp;MHz) are generally operated at series resonance where the impedance appears at its minimum and equal to the series resistance. For this reason the series resistance is specified (f = f_0\ \mbox(T-T_0)^2In a real application, this means that a clock built using a regular 32&nbsp;kHz tuning fork crystal will keep good time at room temperature, lose 2 minutes per year at 10 degrees Celsius above (or below) room temperature and lose 8 minutes per year at 20 degrees Celsius above (or below) room temperature due to the quartz crystal.Electrical oscillatorsequipment to select frequency.]]The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator. The rate of expansion and contraction of the quartz is the resonant frequency, and is determined by the cut and size of the crystal. When the energy of the generated output frequencies matches the losses in the circuit, an oscillation can be sustained.A regular timing crystal contains two electrically conductive plates, with a slice or tuning fork of quartz crystal sandwiched between them. During startup, the circuit around the crystal applies a random noise AC signal to it, and purely by chance, a tiny fraction of the noise will be at the resonant frequency of the crystal. The crystal will therefore start oscillating in synchrony with that signal. As the oscillator amplifies the signals coming out of the crystal, the signals in the crystal's frequency band will become stronger, eventually dominating the output of the oscillator. Natural resistance in the circuit and in the quartz crystal filter out all the unwanted frequencies.The output frequency of a quartz oscillator can be either the fundamental resonance or a multiple of the resonance, called an overtone frequency. High frequency crystals are often designed to operate at third, fifth, or seventh overtones.A major reason for the wide use of crystal oscillators is their high Q factor. A typical ''Q'' for a quartz oscillator ranges from 104 to 106, compared to perhaps 102 for an LC oscillator. The maximum Q'' for a high stability quartz oscillator can be estimated as ''Q = 1.6 &times; 107/''f'', where f is the resonance frequency in megahertz.One of the most important traits of quartz crystal oscillators is that they can exhibit very low phase noise. In many oscillators, any spectral energy at the resonant frequency will be amplified by the oscillator, resulting in a collection of tones at different phases. In a crystal oscillator, the crystal mostly vibrates in one axis. Therefore, only one phase is dominant. This property of low phase noise makes them particularly useful in telecommunications where stable signals are needed, and in scientific equipment where very precise time references are needed.Environmental changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and vibration can change the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal, but there are several designs that reduce these environmental effects. These include the TCXO, MCXO, and OCXO (defined below). These designs (particularly the OCXO) often produce devices with excellent short-term stability. The limitations in short-term stability are due mainly to noise from electronic components in the oscillator circuits. Long term stability is limited by aging of the crystal.Due to aging and environmental factors such as temperature and vibration, it is hard to keep even the best quartz oscillators within one part in 10−10 of their nominal frequency without constant adjustment. For this reason, atomic oscillators are used for applications that require better long-term stability and accuracy.Although crystals can be fabricated for any desired resonant frequency, within technological limits, in actual practice today engineers design crystal oscillator circuits around relatively few standard frequencies, such as 3.58&nbsp;MHz, 10&nbsp;MHz, 14.318&nbsp;MHz, 20&nbsp;MHz, 33.33&nbsp;MHz, and 40&nbsp;MHz. The vast popularity of the 3.58&nbsp;MHz and 14.318&nbsp;MHz crystals is attributed initially to low cost resulting from economies of scale resulting from the popularity of television and the fact that this frequency is involved in synchronizing to the colorburst signal necessary to display color on an NTSC or PAL based television set. Using frequency dividers, frequency multipliers and phase locked loop circuits, it is practical to derive a wide range of frequencies from one reference frequency.Care must be taken to use only one crystal oscillator source when designing circuits to avoid subtle failure modes of metastability in electronics. If this is not possible, the number of distinct crystal oscillators, PLLs, and their associated clock domains should be rigorously minimized, through techniques such as using a subdivision of an existing clock instead of a new crystal source. Each new distinct crystal source needs to be rigorously justified, since each one introduces new, difficult to debug probabilistic failure modes, due to multiple crystal interactions, into equipment.Spurious frequenciesFor crystals operated in series resonance, significant (and temperature-dependent) spurious responses may be experienced. These responses typically appear some tens of kilohertz above the wanted series resonance. Even if the series resistances at the spurious resonances appear higher than the one at wanted frequency, the oscillator may lock at a spurious frequency (at some temperatures). This is generally avoided by using low impedance oscillator circuits to enhance the series resistance differences.Commonly used crystal frequenciesFrequency (MHz)Primary uses0.032768Real-time clocks, allows binary division to 1&nbsp;Hz signal (215 × 1&nbsp;Hz); also often used in low-speed low-power circuits1.8432UART clock; allows integer division to common baud rates2.4576UART clock; allows integer division to common baud rates up to 384003.2768Allows binary division to 100&nbsp;Hz (32768 × 100&nbsp;Hz, or 215 × 100&nbsp;Hz)3.575611M]] color subcarrier3.579545NTSC M color subcarrier; very common and inexpensive, used in many other applications, eg.
