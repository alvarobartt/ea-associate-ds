At its brightness of visual magnitude 7.5 and its diameter of about 8 arcminutes, it is easily visible in binoculars, and a great observing target in amateur telescopes.Structureimage showing extended structure and central starCredit: ESO]] This PN appears to be shaped like an prolate spheroid and is viewed from our perspective along the plane of its equator. In 1992, Moreno-Corral et al. computed that the rate of expansion in the plane of the sky of this PN was no more than 2&Prime;.3 per century. From this, an upper limit to the age of 14,600 yr may be determined. In 1970, Bohuski, Smith, & Weedman found an expansion velocity of 31 km/s. Given the semi-minor axis radius of 1.01 ly, this implies that the kinematic age of the PN is 9,800  years old.Knotscloseup of knots in M&nbsp;27Credit: C.R. O'Dell (Vanderbilt University)]]Like many nearby planetary nebulae, the Dumbbell contains knots. Its central region is marked by a pattern of dark and bright cusped knots and their associated dark tails (see picture). The knots vary in appearance from symmetric objects with tails to rather irregular tail-less objects. Similarly to the Helix Nebula and the Eskimo Nebula, the heads of the knots have bright cusps which are local photoionization fronts.Central starThe central star, a white dwarf, is estimated to have a radius which is 0.055 ± 0.02 R&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; which gives it a size larger than any other known white dwarf.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central star mass was estimated in 1999 by Napiwotzki to be 0.56 ± 0.01 [[Solar mass|M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedictetal2003&quot; /&gt;See alsoList of messier objectsList of planetary nebulaeNew General CatalogueNotes  Radius = distance &times; sin(angular size / 2) = 1,240 * sin(8&prime;.0 / 2) = 1.44 ly Semi minor axis = distance &times; sin(minor axis size / 2) = 1,240 * sin(5&prime;.6 / 2) = 1.01 ly Kinematic age = semi-minor axis / expansion rate = 1.01 ly / 31 km/s = 9.56 km / 31 km/s = 3.08 s = 9,800 yr 7.5 apparent magnitude - 5 * (log10(420 pc distance) - 1) = -0.6 absolute magnitude  ReferencesExternal linksSEDS Messier page on M27M27 Dumbbell NebulaM27 image taken by Stargazer ObservatoryM27Category:Planetary nebulae Category:Vulpecula constellation Category:Messier objects Category:NGC objectsbg:M27 ca:Messier 27 cs:Mlhovina Činka co:M27 de:Hantelnebel es:Nebulosa Dumbbell eo:M27 eu:Pisuaren Nebulosa fa:سحابی دمبل fr:Nébuleuse de l'Haltère ko:아령 성운 hr:Messier 27 it:Nebulosa Manubrio lb:Messier 27 lt:Hantelio ūkas hu:Súlyzó-köd nl:Halternevel ja:亜鈴状星雲 nn:Manualtåka pl:Mgławica Hantle ru:Туманность Гантель sk:Hmlovina Činka sl:Ročka (meglica) fi:Nostopainosumu uk:NGC 6853 zh:哑铃星云
