 High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) is a 3G mobile telephony protocol in the HSPA family with up-link speeds up to 5.76 Mbit/s. The name HSUPA was created by Nokia. The 3GPP does not support the name 'HSUPA', but instead uses the name Enhanced Uplink (EUL).3GPP specification: 25.321&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The specifications for HSUPA are included in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Release 6 standard published by 3GPP. – "The technical purpose of the Enhanced Uplink feature is to improve the performance of uplink dedicated transport channels, i.e. to increase capacity and throughput and reduce delay."HSUPA uses an uplink enhanced dedicated channel (E-DCH) on which it will employ link adaptation methods similar to those employed by HSDPA, namely:shorter Transmission Time Interval enabling faster link adaptation;HARQ (hybrid ARQ) with incremental redundancy making retransmissions more effective.Similarly to HSDPA, HSUPA uses a packet scheduler, but it operates on a request-grant principle where the UEs request a permission to send data and the scheduler decides when and how many UEs will be allowed to do so. A request for transmission contains data about the state of the transmission buffer and the queue at the UE and its available power margin. However, unlike HSDPA, uplink transmissions are not orthogonal to each other.In addition to this scheduled mode of transmission the standards also allows a self-initiated transmission mode from the UEs, denoted non-scheduled. The non-scheduled mode can, for example, be used for VoIP services for which even the reduced TTI and the Node B based scheduler will not be able to provide the very short delay time and constant bandwidth required.Each MAC-d flow (i.e. QoS flow) is configured to use either scheduled or non-scheduled modes; the UE adjusts the data rate for scheduled and non-scheduled flows independently. The maximum data rate of each non-scheduled flow is configured at call setup, and typically not changed frequently. The power used by the scheduled flows is controlled dynamically by the Node B through absolute grant (consisting of an actual value) and relative grant (consisting of a single up/down bit) messages.At Layer 1, HSUPA introduces new physical channels E-AGCH (Access Grant Channel), E-DCH Relative Grant Channel, F-DPCH (Fractional-DPCH), E-HICH (E-DCH Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel), E-DPCCH (E-DCH Dedicated Physical Control Channel) and E-DPDCH (E-DCH Dedicated Physical Data Channel).E-DPDCH is used to carry the E-DCH Transport Channel; and E-DPCCH is used to carry the control information associated with the E-DCH.VersionsThe following table gives uplink speeds for the different categories of HSUPA.HSUPA CategoryMax Uplink SpeedCategory 10.73 Mbit/sCategory 21.46 Mbit/sCategory 31.46 Mbit/sCategory 42.93 Mbit/sCategory 52.00 Mbit/sCategory 65.76 Mbit/sCategory 7 (3GPP Rel7)11.5 Mbit/sRoadmapAfter HSUPA the 3GPP is working on further advancing transfer rates. LTE provides up to 326.4&nbsp;Mbit/s for downlink and 86.4&nbsp;Mbit/s for uplink. LTE-Advanced, in development as a minor update to LTE networks, supports maximum download rates of over 1 Gbit/s.Adoption (not updated)DevicesSome triband (850/1900/2100 MHz) HSUPA devices are already available:4G Systems – XSPlugP5 (USB-Modem), HSPA-WiFi Router XSBoxR5Advinne – AMC-HSUPA (USB modem)Huawei – E270 Wireless modem (USB), E870 (ExpressCard)Novatel Wireless – Merlin X950D (ExpressCard), Ovation MC950D (USB), Ovation MC930D (USB)ONDA Communication – MT505UP, MH505UP (USB), MDC525UP (USB), ET505UP (ExpressCard)Option – GlobeTrotter Express HSUPA, GlobeTrotter GT MAX HSUPA, GlobeSurfer iCON HSUPA, GTM380Sierra Wireless – AirCard 880/881 (PC Card), AirCard 880E/881E (ExpressCard) and MC 8780/8781 (PCI Express)DOVADO USB Mobile Broadband Router (UMR) - USB router supporting a variety of HSUPA modems from Huawei, Option, Novatel Wireless and Sierra Wireless.Direct http;//www.call-direct.com.au - CDR-780seu (Router)HSUPA Router Bundle.HTC Touch HD - High Resolution PDA.ASUS adds HSUPA (3.75G) to Eee PCSee also3GPP Long Term EvolutionBroadbandDigRF V3High-Speed Downlink Packet AccessHigh-Speed Orthogonal Packet AccessList of device bandwidthsQuad bandTriband (telephone)UMTS frequency bandsReferences Category:Mobile phone standards Category:Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systemde:High Speed Uplink Packet Access es:High-Speed Uplink Packet Access fr:High-Speed Uplink Packet Access it:High-Speed Uplink Packet Access hu:HSUPA nl:High-Speed Uplink Packet Access pl:High Speed Uplink Packet Access ru:HSUPA su:HSUPA sv:HSUPA tr:HSUPA uk:HSUPA zh:HSUPA
