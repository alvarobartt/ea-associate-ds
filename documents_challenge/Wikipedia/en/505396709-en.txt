Rebrov gained international fame as an attacking partner of Andriy Shevchenko at Dynamo Kyiv throughout the 1990s and is known for his technical ability as well as his finishing. Rebrov is currently at his new club Rubin Kazan, having also previously played for Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk, Tottenham Hotspur, Fenerbahçe and West Ham United.Club careerRebrov joined Shakhtar Donetsk as a youth in 1990. In his debut 1991 season, then a 17-year-old, he scored 2 goals in 7 games in the USSR Premier League. In his second season, playing in the newly established Ukrainian Premier League, he became a joint 3rd goalscorer, catching the eye of Dynamo Kyiv scouts.Dynamo KyivRebrov moved to Dynamo Kyiv in August 1992 and has since become the highest all-time scorer in the Ukrainian Premier League. As of April 3, 2007, his total tally in the league with Shakhtar and Dynamo was 120 goals in 249 games.He scored several key goals in European competitions, notably in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons of the UEFA Champions League, including a famous goal against Barcelona from a tight angle. Dynamo reached the Champions League semi-final in 1999 but lost to Bayern Munich on aggregate. In the 1999-00 season Rebrov became a joint top scorer in the UEFA Champions League with 10 goals (including 2 goals in qualification games) as Dynamo progressed to the last sixteen before going out on head-to-head record against Real Madrid. As of September 14, 2006 Rebrov remained a joint 13th all-time scorer in the history of the Champions League/European Cup with 30 goals.EnglandIn June 2000 he was transferred to Tottenham Hotspur for £11 million, but after the sacking of George Graham in March 2001, he was frozen out by new manager Glenn Hoddle. He went out on two consecutive loan spells to Fenerbahçe and subsequently signed a one year contract with West Ham United.Dynamo Kyiv againOn June 1, 2005, Rebrov became a free agent after declining to re-sign and two days later he signed a new two-year contract with Dynamo Kyiv, with the option of a one year extension. In the new 2005-06 season, Rebrov became Dynamo's top scorer with 13 goals, two behind league joint top scorers Brandão and Okoduwa, despite playing in midfield. Rebrov also topped the league in points (goals plus assists) and was named player of the season according to a poll of team coaches and captains.In July 2007 Rebrov became Dynamo captain. In the 2007-08 season he was getting less playing time, starting only 7 out of 18 matches before the winter break. His contribution in some games was heavily criticised by the press. It was reported that Rebrov could move to Arsenal Kyiv during the transfer window. However, under new coach Yuri Semin Rebrov started all games and was named best player at the close season Channel One Cup. In February 2008 Dynamo president Ihor Surkis stated that the club was planning talks with Rebrov with a view of extending his contract. Shortly thereafter Rebrov received an offer of a two-year contract from Russian Premier League club Rubin Kazan.Rubin KazanOn March 3, 2008 Dynamo announced that Rebrov had signed a two-year contract with Rubin and would join the new club at the end of the season, in summer 2008. With the Russian season starting in spring, Rubin eventually agreed a $1 million compensation with Dynamo for Rebrov's early release from his contract.ControversySergei Rebrov was at the centre of a race row in September 2008 by giving Spurs new signing Roman Pavlyuchenko some controversial advice. The former Tottenham striker reportedly warned Pavlyuchenko not to go out near White Hart Lane - because lots of "dark-skinned people" live there. According to the Daily Mirror, Rebrov's comments came in an interview in Russian magazine Football Weekly on how £13.8 million signing Pavlyuchenko should adapt to British life.Rebrov, who played for Spurs between 2000 and 2004, said: "I wouldn't go for a walk on my own around White Hart Lane. A lot of dark-skinned people live there. So naturally the crime rate is higher than anywhere else. It's not nice to be a robbery victim. So I suggest that Roman doesn't walk but drives around that area."http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/09/10/exclusive-ex-spurs-star-sergei-rebrov-s-racist-advice-for-roman-pavlyuchenko-115875-20731097/&lt;/ref&gt;National team careerRebrov's club exploits earned him a recall to the national team and a ticket to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, where he scored a long range shot against Saudi Arabia as Ukraine progressed to the quarterfinals before going down to Italy.He is currently (as of November 21, 2007) the forth most capped player in the Ukrainian national team history having represented his country 75 times and is their second all-time scorer with 15 goals.Career statisticsClub careerThe following table is up to date as of 24 November 2007.ClubSeasonLeagueCupSuper CupEuropeTotalAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsShakhtar Donetsk19917211000072199219100000001910All26121100002612Dynamo Kyiv1992-932356200203171993-941021000211331994-9524861007137101995-9631951002038101996-97302010004035201997-982922870012849371998-99229550014841221999-002018420016104030All189933618005928284139Tottenham Hotspur2000-0129973000036122001-023119300004042002-030000000000All601016600007616Fenerbahçe2002-031320000001322003-04252210000273All384210000405West Ham2004-05271510000322All271510000322Dynamo Kyiv2005-06271351101034142006-071762010722782007-0881100041132All522081201237424Career totals3921406828206931532198International careerThe following table is up to date as of 29 March 2008.National teamSeasonAppsGoalsUkraine1992&ndash;931-1993&ndash;943-1994&ndash;95--1995&ndash;961-1996&ndash;971031997&ndash;98411998&ndash;99951999&ndash;00832000&ndash;017-2001&ndash;02812002&ndash;037-2003&ndash;047-2004&ndash;05--2005&ndash;06922006&ndash;071-2007&ndash;08--Career Totals7515International goalsThe following table is up to date as of 23 June 2006. + Serhiy Rebrov: International Goals#DateVenueOpponentScoreResultCompetition1.August 31, 1996Belfast, Northern IrelandNIR0–1WonWC 1998 Qual2.March 23, 1997Kyiv, UkraineMDA1–0WonFriendly3.March 29, 1997Tirana, AlbaniaALB0-1WonWC 1998 Qual4.August 20, 1997Kyiv, UkraineALB1-0WonWC 1998 Qual5.August 19, 1998Kyiv, UkraineGEO|19904-0WonFriendly6.August 19, 1998Kyiv, UkraineGEO|19904-0WonFriendly7.September 5, 1998Kyiv, UkraineRUS3-2WonEC 2000 Qual8.October 10, 1998Andorra la Vella, AndorraAND0-2WonEC 2000 Qual9.June 5, 1999Kyiv, UkraineAND4-0WonEC 2000 Qual10.August 18, 1999Kyiv, UkraineBUL1-1DrawFriendly11.September 8, 1999Reykjavík, IcelandISL0-1WonEC 2000 Qual12.November 17, 1999Kyiv, UkraineSVN1-1DrawEC 2000 Qual Playoff13.April 17, 2002Kyiv, UkraineGEO|19902-1WonFriendly14.August 17, 2005Kyiv, UkraineSCG2-1WonFriendly15.June 19, 2006Hamburg, GermanyKSA0-4WonWC 2006 Group HAwards and honoursTrophiesUkrainian Premier League: 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99, 1999-00, 2006-07Ukrainian Cup: 1993, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007Ukrainian Super Cup: 2006Turkish League: 2003-04Individual honoursUkrainian Footballer of the Year: 1996, 1998Ukrainian Premier League Player of the Season: 1997-98, 1999-00, 2005-06Ukrainian Premier League Top Scorer: 1997-98Ukrainian Premier League Top All-Time ScorerEuropean Cup/UEFA Champions League Joint Top Scorer: 1999-00ReferencesExternal linksProfile on Dynamo Website - Dynamo Kyiv Official Website   Yuri Kalitvintsev |after= Andriy Shevchenko|years=1996  Andriy Shevchenko |after= Andriy Shevchenko|years=1998   Category:1974 births Category:People from Gorlovka Category:Living people Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Ukrainian footballers Category:Ukrainian expatriate footballers Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:Ukraine international footballers Category:FC Shakhtar Donetsk players Category:Dynamo Kyiv players Category:Tottenham Hotspur F.C. players Category:Fenerbahçe footballers Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:FC Rubin Kazan playersar:سيرجي ريبروف bg:Сергей Ребров de:Serhij Rebrow es:Serjiy Rebrov fr:Sergueï Rebrov id:Serhiy Rebrov it:Serhij Stanislavovyč Rebrov lt:Serhijus Rebrovas hu:Szerhij Sztanyiszlavovics Rebrov nl:Serhij Rebrov ja:セルゲイ・レブロフ pl:Serhij Rebrow pt:Serhiy Rebrov ru:Ребров, Сергей Станиславович fi:Serhi Rebrov tr:Sergiy Rebrov uk:Ребров Сергій Станіславович zh:谢尔盖·雷布罗夫
