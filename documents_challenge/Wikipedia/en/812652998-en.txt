USA for Africa (United Support of Artists for Africa), was the name under which forty-five predominantly U.S. artists, led by Harry Belafonte, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Lionel Richie, recorded the hit single "We Are the World" in 1985. The song was a US and UK Number One for the collective in April of that year.The considerable profits from the enterprise went to the USA for Africa Foundation, which used them for the relief of famine and disease in Africa and specifically to 1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia; critics, however, claim that this money went directly to the (often military) governments of the affected countries rather than the people.A recording of the live performance was released with the Live Aid DVD set released on November 8, 2004.PerformersDan Aykroyd (The only Canadian, and one of two non-American performers)Harry BelafonteLindsey BuckinghamKim CarnesRay CharlesBob DylanSheila E.Bob Geldof (The only Irishman, and one of two non-American performers)Hall &amp; OatesJames IngramJermaine JacksonJackie JacksonLaToya JacksonMarlon JacksonMichael JacksonRandy JacksonTito JacksonAl JarreauWaylon JenningsBilly JoelCyndi LauperHuey Lewis and the NewsKenny LogginsBette MidlerWillie NelsonJeffrey OsborneDavid PaichSteve PerryThe Pointer SistersSteve PorcaroKenny RogersDiana RossLionel RichieSmokey RobinsonPaul SimonBruce SpringsteenTina TurnerDionne WarwickStevie WonderSee alsoBand AidCharity recordCharity supergroupCome Together NowComic ReliefChildren in NeedChildLineHear 'n AidLive 8Live AidNorthern LightsSport AidSport ReliefExternal linksUSA for Africa official siteCategory:1985 in the United States Category:1980s music groups Category:Supergroups Category:American pop music groups Category:Musical advocacy groupsde:USA for Africa es:USA for Africa fr:USA for Africa id:USA for Africa it:USA for Africa nl:USA for Africa ja:USAフォー・アフリカ no:USA for Africa pl:USA for Africa pt:USA for Africa ru:USA for Africa sv:USA for Africa
