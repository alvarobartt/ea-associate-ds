It is known as "The Pearl of province of Treviso", and also as "The City of a Hundred Horizons" for its mountain settings.HistoryThe town was originally a settlement of the Veneti, and was mentioned as Acelum in the works of Pliny.In the early Middle Ages it was under the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Treviso and a possession of the Ezzelino family.Later Asolo was the capital, and seat of the court, of the fiefdom of Asolo, which was granted by the Republic of Venice (to which it belonged) to Caterina Cornaro, the former Queen of Cyprus; in 1489 it was granted to her for life, but in 1509 when the League of Cambrai conquered and ransacked Asolo, Caterina fled to exile and died in Venice a year later. Under her reign, the painter Gentile Bellini and the humanist Cardinal Pietro Bembo were part of the court. Caterina's personal theatre was later purchased by Ringling (of Ringling Circus fame), crated up and shipped to Sarasota, Florida, where it was reassembled. The Asolo Theatre remains there today, where it enjoys a renaissance of theatre performances.The town was also home to the English poet Robert Browning, the actress Eleonora Duse, the explorer Freya Stark, the violinist Wilma Neruda and the composer Gian Francesco Malipiero.Main sightsremains of an amphitheatre (in the Villa Freya) and of an aqueduct.Rocca (castle, late 12th-early 13th centuries).The Castle of Caterina Cornaro, now home to the Eleonora Duse theatre.Palazzo della Ragione, housing the city's museum.The Cathedral, built in 1747. In the interior is the Assunta altarpiece by Lorenzo Lotto.Atop the town sits a converted monastery that now houses a university: CIMBA (Consortium International for Management and Business Analysis)http://www.cimbaitaly.com.
