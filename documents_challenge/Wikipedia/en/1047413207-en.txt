 [[Image:Urania.jpg|thumb|Detail of the painting The Muses Urania and Calliope by Simon Vouet.]]In Greek mythology, Urania (Οὐρανία,  in English), which means "heavenly", was the muse of astronomy and astrology. She is usually depicted as having a globe in her left hand and a peg in the right, and her foot on a turtle, symbol of silence. She is able to foretell the future by the position of the stars. She is often associated with Universal Love and the Holy Spirit. She is dressed in a cloak embroidered with stars and keeps her eyes and attention focused on the Heavens. Those who are most concerned with philosophy and the heavens are dearest to her.Urania, o'er her star-bespangled lyre,With touch of majesty diffused her soul;A thousand tones, that in the breast inspire,''Exalted feelings, o er the wires'gan roll--''How at the call of Jove the mist unfurled,And o'er the swelling vault-- the glowing sky,The new-born stars hung out their lamps on high,And rolled their mighty orbs to music's sweetest sound. During the Renaissance, Urania began to be considered the Muse for Christian poets. Urania is the "heavenly muse" invoked in John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost. In Muse (magazine), a magazine for children, Urania is one of the characters in the "Kokopelli and Co." comic by Larry Gonick published in each issue of the magazine. She is the only "old muse" who remains among the "new muses" featured in the magazine. Her name has been used to name astronomical observatories such as the Urania in Berlin, Vienna, Zurich and Antwerp and Uraniborg on the island of Hven. There is a Urania Street in New Orleans, between Polymnia ("Polyhymnia") and Felicity Streets. Hr.Ms. Urania is a sail training vessel for the Royal Netherlands Naval College. There has been a Hr.Ms. Urania in the Royal Netherlands Navy since 1832.Urania is also de name of a popular female fronted rock band in Honduras.
