On the road in 1962, he rode the Vuelta a España, winning three stages and taking overall victory. Later that summer, he wore the maillot jaune for five days in the Tour de France, winning three stages and the overall points competition, and finishing 31st overall.Two years later, he improved to 12th in the Tour (taking another stage win in the process), having earlier in the season won his first Classic, the 1964 Ronde van Vlaanderen. In 1965 he finished second to Englishman Tom Simpson in the World professional road racing championship in San Sebastián, Spain.But the world title was not denied for long: he won the 1966 championship not too far away from his home, at the Nürburgring. He also took three stage wins in that year's Tour de France (taking another 12th place overall) and two more in the Giro d'Italia (for an eventual 13th place).The second and final Classic win came in the 1968 Milan-Sanremo. He also took two stages of that year's Vuelta, finishing 18th overall. In 1969 he finished 9th in the Giro, and won the prologue individual time trial of the Tour de France.Six-day track starAn accomplished track rider, Altig recorded 22 six-day victories: (with Hans Junkermann)1962: Berlin, Münster1963: Essen1964: Essen(with Fritz Pfenninger)1964: Dortmund, Frankfurt am Main1970: Dortmund1971: Bremen, Cologne(with Dieter Kemper)1965: Berlin, Frankfurt a.
