   An arrest is the act of depriving a person of his or her liberty usually in relation to the investigation and prevention of crime. The term is Anglo-Norman in origin and is related to the French word arrêt, meaning "stop". ProcedureUnited StatesFor serious crimes, the police typically handcuff the suspect (even if they are not being violent) and bring him/her to a police station or a jail where he/she will be incarcerated pending a judicial bail determination or an arraignment. In other instances, the police may issue a notice to appear specifying where a suspect is to appear for their arraignment.United KingdomIn English law, whether a person has been arrested does not depend on the legal authority of the person enforcing the arrest, rather it depends upon whether he has been deprived of his liberty to go where he pleasesLewis v Chief Constable of the South Wales Constabulary 1991 1 All ER 206. Whether an arrest is lawful depends on whether the police officer or civilian exercising the arrest is acting within the scope of his powers.Upon arrest a person must ordinarily be taken to a police station as soon as is practicable,Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 30. but may be released on bail.Powers of ArrestUnited KingdomPolice officers have the following powers to effect arrests without warrant:ProvisionExtent of PowerPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 24Power to arrestPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Schedule 2Various specific powers of arrestCriminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Part XCross-border powers of arrestCommon lawBreach of the peaceCode G to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 deals with powers of arrest under section 24.

Civilians have restricted powers of arrest without warrant in relation to very serious offencesPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 24A and breach of the peace.Warnings on arrestUnited Statesofficers arrest a man]]  The reading of the Miranda warning or similar "caution" to an arrestee advising him or her of rights is not legally required upon arrest. A legal caution is required only when a person has been taken into custody and is interrogated. Legal cautions are mandated in the US, most Commonwealth and other common law jurisdictions, and countries where the right to legal counsel, the right to silence, and the right against self-incrimination have been clearly established.United Kingdom In the United Kingdom a person must be told that he is under arrest Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 28, and "told in simple, non-technical language that he could understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest" Taylor v Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police 2004 EWCA Civ 858. A person must be 'cautioned' when being arrested unless this is impractical due to the behaviour of the arrestee i.e. violence or drunkenness. The caution required in England and Wales states, You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something that you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.Code C to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, para. 10.5.Search on arrestUnited KingdomOtherwise than in relation to terrorist suspects, a police constable has the following powers where he arrests a person outside a police stationPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 32.:Search personSearch propertySeize propertyincluding a right to require a suspect to remove an outer coat, jacket or gloves (but nothing else) and to search the arrested person's mouthany premises in which the person arrested was when arrested or immediately beforeDangerif the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may have articles that can present a danger to himself or othersif the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the person searched might use the property to cause physical injury to himself or to any other personEscapeto the extent that is reasonably required if the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be searched may have concealed on him anything which he might use to assist him to escape from lawful custodyother than an item subject to legal privilege, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that he might use it to assist him to escape from lawful custodyEvidenceto the extent that is reasonably required if the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be searched may have concealed on him anything which might be evidence relating to an offenceif the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that there is evidence relating to the offence for which the person has been arrestedother than an item subject to legal privilege, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that it is evidence of an offence or has been obtained in consequence of the commission of an offenceNon-criminal arrestsUnited StatesBreach of a court order can be civil contempt of court, and a warrant may issue for the person's arrest. Some court orders contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order.If a legislature lacks a quorum, many jurisdictions allow the members present the power to order a call of the house, which orders the arrest of the members who are not present. A member arrested is brought to the body's chamber to achieve a quorum. The member "arrested" does not face prosecution, but may be required to pay a fine to the legislative body.Ordinarily only human beings can be arrested, but recent and somewhat controversial changes to criminal codes have allowed for the arrest not only of the usual "contraband, evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities" of crime, but also of inanimate objects such as money, automobiles, houses, and other personal property under asset forfeiture.Following arrestWhile an arrest will not necessarily lead to a criminal conviction, it may nonetheless have serious ramifications such as a loss of employment due to inability to pay bail, social stigma and (in some cases) the legal obligation to declare arrests when applying for a job, loan or professional license. These collateral consequences are more severe in the United States than in the UK, where arrests without conviction are not usually considered significant and are not even reported in a standard criminal record check. Even in the US, innocent people can often have their arrest records removed through an expungement or Finding of Factual Innocence. Nevertheless, arrests should not be made lightly as a wrongfully arrested person may sue the arresting authority for damages.See alsoCitizen's arrestHouse arrestArrestable offence (obsolete term in UK law)Law enforcement agency#Powers of a Law Enforcement AgencyNightwalker_StatuteResisting arrestReferencesCategory:Criminal law Category:Law enforcement terminology Category:Law enforcement agency powersde:Festnahme es:Arresto eo:Aresto fr:Arrestation it:Arresto he:מעצר hu:Előzetes letartóztatás nl:Arrestatie ja:逮捕 no:Anholdelse pl:Areszt sq:Arrestimi simple:Arrest sr:Притвор sv:Arrestering uk:Арешт yi:ארעסט zh:逮捕
