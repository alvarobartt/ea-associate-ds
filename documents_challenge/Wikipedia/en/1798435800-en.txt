 Star Alliance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Star Alliance is the world's first and largest airline alliance.

Before being accepted as a regional member, airline must be sponsored by a full member. Full members may have some affiliate airlines (that either are owned by or are in a contractual relationship with a Star Alliance full member). Affiliate airlines fall under full member umbrella in respect to the Star Alliance rules, policies and benefits. All of the affiliate airlines grant Star Alliance frequent flyer benefits, and usually feature the Star Alliance logo on their aircraft, public relation materials and advertisement. In some cases (such as Air New Zealand link airlines and BMI Regional) the branding of the "parent" full member may be so strong as to mean passengers are unaware of the affiliate's independent existence.Full members and their affiliates Air Canada* http://www.aircanada.com/ Air Canada Jazz Air China http://www.airchina.com.cn Air New Zealand http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/ Air Nelson Eagle Airways Mount Cook Airline ANA All Nippon Airways http://www.anaskyweb.com/ Air Nippon Air Central Air Japan Air Next Asiana Airlines http://www.flyasiana.com/ Air Busan Austrian Airlines http://www.aua.com Tyrolean Airways http://www.tyrolean.at Lauda Air http://www.laudaair.com bmi http://www.flybmi.com/ bmi baby bmi Regional EgyptAir http://www.egyptair.com EgyptAir Express http://www.egyptair.com/English/AboutEgyptAir/NewsPress/StarAlliance.htm LOT Polish Airlines http://www.lot.com/ EuroLOT http://www.eurolot.com.pl/ Lufthansa* http://www.lufthansa.com/ Lufthansa Regional http://konzern.lufthansa.com/en/html/ueber_uns/allianzen/lufthansa_regional/partner/index.html Augsburg Airways http://www.augsburgair.de/ Contact Air http://www.contactair.de/ Eurowings http://www.eurowings.com/en/ Lufthansa CityLine http://www.lufthansacityline.com/en/index.html Air Dolomiti http://www.airdolomiti.it/en/ Scandinavian Airlines System* http://www.flysas.com/ Shanghai Airlines http://www.shangahi-air.com Singapore Airlines http://www.singaporeair.com/ South African Airways http://www.flysaa.com/ SA Express http://www.flysax.com/ SA Airlink http://www.saairlink.co.za/ Spanair http://www.spanair.com/ Swiss International Air Lines http://www.swiss.com Swiss European Air Lines TAP Portugal http://www.flytap.com Portugália Thai Airways International* http://www.thaiairways.com Turkish Airlines http://www.thy.com Anadolujet http://www.anadolujet.com SunExpress http://www.sunexpress.com.tr United Airlines* http://www.united.com Ted -Ted is being retired in 2009 and will be replaced with mainline service United Express US Airways http://www.usairways.com US Airways Express* founding membersRegional members Adria Airways http://www.adria-airways.com/index.asp?l=en&amp;p=qb&amp;m=0 (sponsored by Lufthansa) Blue1 http://www.blue1.com (sponsored by SAS) Croatia Airlines http://www.croatiaairlines.com (sponsored by Lufthansa)Future members Air India was invited to join Star Alliance on December 13, 2007, and is scheduled to be a full member by mid 2009. http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=aeYKELW6DcsU&amp;refer=indiaThe combined entity has also confirmed that it has gained membership within Star Alliance and will expand its own network to be one of Asia's largest carriers.
