Currently, the internationally recognized territory of Pakistan is subdivided into four provinces and two territories. In addition, the portion of Kashmir that is administered by the Pakistani government is divided into two separate administrative units.Local GovernmentsThe provinces are divided into a total of 105 Zillahs (Urdu: ضلع ) (districts). A zillah is further subdivided into tehsils (Urdu: تحصیل ) (roughly equivalent to counties). Tehsils are used in all provinces except in Sindh province where the term taluka (Urdu: تعلقه ) predominates. Tehsils may contain villages or municipalities. There are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means "supervisor" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as mayor). Women have been allotted a minimum of 33% seats in these councils; there is no upper limit to the number of women in these councils.Some districts, incorporating large metropolitan areas, are called City District. A City District may contain subdivisions called Towns and Union Councils.History In the 1960s, Pakistan was simply divided into two "units" of East Pakistan and West Pakistan. Shortly before East Pakistan became independent as Bangladesh, West Pakistan reverted to a system with four provinces. The provinces consisted of subunits called "divisions", which were further subdivided into districts, tehsils, and villages or municipalities.In August 2000, Pervez Musharraf's local government reforms abolished the "division" as an administrative tier. A system of local government councils was established, with the first elections being held in 2001. Since the 2001 Local Government Ordinances, Pakistan has embarked on a radical restructuring of the local government system. The government is implementing a devolution plan which, in its words, "follows the principle of subsidiarity, whereby all functions that can be effectively performed at the local level are transferred to that level. This has meant the decentralization to the districts and tehsils of many functions previously handled by the provincial governments."==Provinces and territories==  |image=Pakistan tehsils.png|float= |x=0.680|y=0.1400|text=Northern Areas |x=0.660|y=0.2000|text=Azad Kashmir |x=0.510|y=0.2900|text=FATA |x=0.310|y=0.4900|text=[[Baluchistan]] |x=0.610|y=0.3900|text=Punjab |x=0.450|y=0.5900|text=[[Sindh]] |x=0.600|y=0.1800|text=[[NWFP]] |x=0.610|y=0.2290|text=Islamabad Capital Territory |x=0.210|y=0.2900|text=[[Afghanistan]] |x=0.100|y=0.4900|text=[[Iran]] |x=0.650|y=0.0600|text=[[China]] |x=0.750|y=0.5900|text=[[India]] |x=0.250|y=0.6400|text=Arabian Sea  Provinces:Balochistan;North-West Frontier Province;Punjab;Sindh.Territories:   Islamabad Capital Territory  Federally Administered Tribal Areas Pakistani Kashmir region:   Azad Kashmir  Federally Administered Northern Areas, Pakistan See alsoDistricts of PakistanExternal linksGovernment of Azad KashmirGovernment of BalochistanGovernment of the Federally Administered Tribal AreasGovernment of the Islamabad Capital TerritoryGovernment of the Northern AreasGovernment of the North-West Frontier ProvinceGovernment of the PunjabGovernment of the SindhDecentralization Support ProgramNational Reconstruction BureauP * de:Verwaltungsgliederung Pakistans es:Organización territorial de Pakistán fr:Provinces et territoires du Pakistan nl:Bestuurlijke indeling van Pakistan ja:パキスタンの行政区画 pl:Podział administracyjny Pakistanu pt:Subdivisões do Paquistão ru:Административное деление Пакистана simple:Subdivisions of Pakistan sr:Административна подела Пакистана zh:巴基斯坦行政区划
