It is mainly famous for its medieval architecture, especially its towers, which may be seen from several kilometers outside the town.The town also is known for the white wine, Vernaccia di San Gimignano, grown in the area.==History== San Gimignano was founded as a small village in the 3rd century BC by the Etruscans. Historical records begin in the 10th century, when it adopted the name of the bishop Saint Geminianus, who had defended it from Attila's Huns.In the Middle Ages and Renaissance era, it was a stopping point for Catholic pilgrims on their way to Rome and the Vatican, as it sits on the medieval Via Francigena. The city's development also was improved by the trade of agricultural products from the fertile neighbouring hills.In 1199, during the period of its highest splendour, the city made itself independent from the bishops of Volterra. Divisions between Guelphs and Ghibellines troubled the inner life of the commune, which nonetheless, still managed to embellish itself with artworks and architectures.Saint Fina, known also as Seraphina and Serafina, was a thirteenth century Italian saint born in San Gimignano during 1238. Since Saint Fina died on March 12, 1253 her feast day became March 12. Her major shrine is in San Gimignano and the house said to be her home still stands in the town.On May 8, 1300, San Gimignano hosted Dante Alighieri in his role of ambassador of the Guelph League in Tuscany.The city flourished until 1348, when the plague that affected all of Europe, compelled it to submit to Florence. San Gimignano became a secondary centre until the nineteenth century, when its status as a touristic and artistic resort began to be recognized.Main sightsWhile in other cities, such as Bologna or Florence, most or all of their towers have been brought down due to wars, catastrophes, or urban renewal, San Gimignano has managed to conserve fourteen towers of varying height which have become its international symbol.There are many churches in the town: the two main ones are the Collegiata, formerly a cathedral, and Sant'Agostino, housing a wide representation of artworks from some of the main Italian renaissance artists.The Communal Palace, once seat of the podestà, is currently home of the Town Gallery, with works by Pinturicchio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Filippino Lippi, Domenico di Michelino, Pier Francesco Fiorentino, and others. From Dante's Hall in the palace, access may be made to a Majesty fresco by Lippo Memmi, as well as the Torre del Podestà or Torre Grossa, 1311, which stands fifty-four meters high.The heart of the town contains the four squares, Piazza della Cisterna, Piazza Duomo where the Collegiata is located, Piazza Pecori, and Piazza delle Erbe. The main streets are Via San Matteo and Via San Giovanni, which cross the city from north to south.CultureSan Gimignano is the birthplace of the poet Folgore da San Gimignano (1270-1332).A fictionalised version of San Gimignano is featured in E.M. Forster's 1905 novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread as Monteriano.It is thought that the towers are the inspiration for the design of the campus of the University of Essex and of the residential colleges of Ezra Stiles and Morse at Yale University.M. C. Escher's 1923 woodcut, San Gimignano, http://www.mcescher.com depicts the celebrated towers.Tea with Mussolini, a 1999 drama about the plight of English and American expatriate women in Italy during World War II, was filmed in part at San Gimignano. The frescoes that the women save are inside the Duomo, the town's main church.In the fictional novel The Broker by John Grisham, Joel Backman takes his second of three wives on vacation in Italy to keep her from divorcing him. They rent a fourteenth-century monastery near San Gimignano for a month.==Gallery==  Image:San Gimignano.JPG|View of San Gimignano against a stormy sky Image:Sangimignano11.jpg|The countryside from one of the tallest towers Image:San gimignano.jpg|The square of the fountain - Piazza del Cisterna Image:San Gimignano - Torres.JPG|Two towersImage:San gimignano, porta san matteo.JPG|The Portal of San Matteo Image:Fonti medievali di san gimignano.jpg|Medieval fountains Image:San gimignano bastione mura 01.JPG|A bastion in the defensive walls Image:San gimignano edificio.JPG|A tower houseImage:Pieve di Cèllole.jpg|The Romanesque Pieve di Cèllole Image:Sangimignano flickr02.jpg|Hand-painted ceramics are a product of the town Image:SanGimignanoPiazzaDuomo.jpg|The Collegiate Church is famous for its frescos Image:Gregorius de Grote kondigt de dood aan van Fina.jpg|A fresco of Saint Fina in the church External linksSan Gimignano - The town of the beautiful towersA Walk in San Gimignano360° Photo Tour &amp; Information on San GimignanoHistory and tourist information on San Gimignano[http://www.san-gimignano.com San Gimignano]Video Introduction to San GimignanoCategory:Hilltowns in Italy Category:Cities and towns in Tuscany Category:Towers in Italy Category:World Heritage Sites in Italy Category:Wine regions of Italy Category:Hilltowns in Tuscanyca:San Gimignano cs:San Gimignano da:San Gimignano de:San Gimignano es:San Gimignano eo:San Gimignano fr:San Gimignano id:San Gimignano it:San Gimignano he:סן ג'ימיניאנו la:Sanctus Giminianus hu:San Gimignano nl:San Gimignano ja:サン・ジミニャーノ nap:San Gimignano no:San Gimignano pl:San Gimignano pt:San Gimignano ro:San Gimignano ru:Сан-Джиминьяно simple:San Gimignano fi:San Gimignano sv:San Gimignano th:ซานจิมิยาโน vec:San Gimignan vo:San Gimignano
