During seven seasons as a youth player he was a prolific scorer, scoring 150 goals, breaking the goalscoring record previously held by Raúl González. In 2002, he signed his first professional contract, running until 2007, with a release clause of €35million.In January 2004, Portillo was loaned to the Serie A club ACF Fiorentina, after scoring 6 league goals, 8 cup goals, and 3 in the UEFA Champions League for Real Madrid. The following season he was not part of new coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo's plans, and was loaned to Belgian side Club Brugge. Some people claimed that it was pressure from team leader and captain Raúl, that Portillo did not get much game time. Portillo was predicted to become the new and better Raul, but lack of playing time put an end to that comparison.At the end of this loan period, Portillo returned to Real, under newly-hired coach Fabio Capello. However, with the squad featuring the likes of Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Antonio Cassano, and Ronaldo, Portillo again found himself surplus to requirements and was allowed to find a new club. He signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Gimnàstic de Tarragona, joining on a free transfer. After a very successful individual season (11 league goals, although the Catalan side was relegated), he replaced, on July 2007, Roberto Soldado at Osasuna, who returned to Real Madrid.Goal.comCareer statistics  |- |2001-02||rowspan="3"|Real Madrid||rowspan="3"|La Liga||-||-||-||-||||||1||1||||| |- |2002-03||10||5||6||8||||||7||1|||| |- |2003-04||18||1||7||1||||||4||0||||  |- |2004-05||Fiorentina||Serie A||11||1||7||3||||||-||-||||  |- |2004-05||Real Madrid||La Liga||3||0||1||0||||||-||-||||  |- |2005-06||Brugge||First Division||24||8||-||-||||||8||3||||  |- |2006-07||Gimnàstic Tarragona||La Liga||34||11||2||1||||||-||-|||| |- |2007-08||rowspan="2"|Osasuna||rowspan="2"|La Liga||18||2||2||0||||||-||-|||| |- |2008-09||1||1|||||||||||||||| 84||20||18||10|||||||||||| 11||1||7||3|||||||||||| 24||8||-||-|||||||||||| 119||29||25||13||||||20||5|||| |Honours1 UEFA Champions League: 2001-021 Intercontinental Cup: 20021 European Super Cup: 20021 La Liga: 2002-031 Supercopa de España: 2003References JavierPortillo forumhttp://javierportillo.forumh.bizExternal linksProfile and statistics at FootballDatabaseJavier Portillo Forum and Fan site Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish footballers Category:Madrilenian people Category:Club Brugge K.V. players Category:Serie A players Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:ACF Fiorentina players Category:La Liga footballers Category:Real Madrid Castilla footballers Category:Real Madrid C.F. players Category:Gimnàstic de Tarragona footballers Category:CA Osasuna footballersca:Javier García Portillo de:Javier Portillo es:Javier García Portillo eu:Javier Portillo fr:Javier Portillo id:Javier Portillo it:Javier Portillo hu:Javier Portillo nl:Javier Portillo ja:ハビエル・ポルティージョ pl:Javier Portillo sv:Javier Portillo
