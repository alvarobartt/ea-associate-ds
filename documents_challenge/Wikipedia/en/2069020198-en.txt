The Tánaiste (; plural: Tánaistí ), or, more formally, An TánaisteRetaining the Irish definite article an  instead of English the., is the deputy prime minister of Ireland. The Taoiseach nominates a member of the government to the position of Tánaiste. The current Tánaiste is Mary Coughlan, TD. Tánaiste was originally the Irish word for the heir of the chief (taoiseach) or king (rí), under the Gaelic system of tanistry.OverviewThe office was created in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, replacing the previous office of Vice-President of the Executive Council that had existed under the Free State constitution. The Tánaiste acts in the place of the Taoiseach during his or her temporary absence, and, until a successor has been appointed, in the event of the Taoiseach's death or permanent incapacitation. The Tánaiste must be a member of Dáil Éireann, and is ex-officio a member of the Council of State. The Tánaiste would usually chair meetings of the government if the Taoiseach is absent or take questions on his behalf in the Dáil or Seanad.Aside from these duties, the title is largely honorific in practice. The constitution does not give the Tánaiste specific powers other than deputising for the Taoiseach. Under a coalition government the position is commonly held by the leader of the second-largest party who in this situation is free to head any department he or she wants. Recent Tánaistí, such as Michael McDowell, Mary Harney and Dick Spring, have been leaders of smaller parties. In a single-party government the Tánaiste is often an 'elder statesman' holding one of the less important ministerial portfolios.List of TánaistíNamePictureEntered officeLeft officePolitical partyOther ministerial offices held while in postSeán T.
