It was traditionally founded by Arsaces I (reigned c. 250 BC&ndash;211 BC), and was reputedly the royal necropolis of the Parthian kings, although it has neither been established that the fortress at Nisa was a royal residence nor a mausoleum.Excavations at Nisa have revealed substantial buildings, mausoleums and shrines, many inscribed documents, and a looted treasury. Many Hellenistic art works have been uncovered, as well as a large number of ivory rhytons, the outer rims decorated with Iranian subjects or classical mythological scenes.Nisa was later renamed Mithradatkirt ("fortress of Mithradates") by Mithridates I (reigned c. 171 BC&ndash;138 BC).Nisa was totally destroyed by an earthquake, which occurred during the first decade BC.The fortress at Nisa was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007."Unesco names World Heritage sites", BBC News, 06-28-2007.See alsoHistory of TurkmenistanReferencesExternal linksArchaeological Missions in NisaNissa Fortress, Ayan Tourism & Travel CompanyHistorical site Nissa, State Committee of Turkmenistan for Tourism and Sport Category:Archaeological sites in Turkmenistan Category:Parthian empire Category:World Heritage Sites in Turkmenistancs:Nisa (Turkmenistán) de:Nisa (Parther) es:Nisa (Turkmenistán) fr:Nisa (Turkménistan) ko:니사 it:Nisa (città) he:ניסה lt:Nisa nl:Nisa (Turkmenistan) ja:ニサ (トルクメニスタン) pl:Nisa (Turkmenistan) ru:Ниса fi:Nisa (Turkmenistan) sv:Nisa
