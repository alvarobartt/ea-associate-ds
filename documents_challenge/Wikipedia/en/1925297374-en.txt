It is classified as a suspected semiregular variable star whose apparent visual magnitude varies from +2.01 to +2.10.NSV 414, database entry, table of suspected variable stars, Combined General Catalog of Variable Stars (GCVS4.2, 2004 Ed.), N. N. Samus, O. V. Durlevich, et al., CDS ID II/250.Observationβ Andromedae is located northeast of the Great Square of Pegasus and is theoretically visible to all observers north of 54° S. Its location in the sky is shown on the left. The galaxy NGC 404, also known as Mirach's Ghost, is visible seven arc-minutes away.Mirach's Ghost (NGC 404), The Internet Encyclopedia of Science, David Darling. Accessed on line August 15, 2008.Naming and etymologyThe name Mirach, and its variations, such as Mirac, Mirar, Mirath, Mirax, etc. (the name is spelled Merach in Burritt's The Geography of the Heavens)p. 18, The Geography of the Heavens, Elijah Hinsdale Burritt, Hiram Mattison, and Henry Whitall, New York: Sheldon & Company, 1856. come from the star's description in the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 as super mizar. Here, mirat is a corruption of the Arabic mizar (English: girdle) which appeared in a Latin translation of the Almagest. This word refers to Mirach's position at the left hip of the princess Andromeda.Mirach, MSN Encarta.

The star has also been called Cingulum and Ventrale.Hũt was an indigenous Arabic constellation, not the Western "Northern Fish" part of the constellation Pisces.These names are not from the Arabic marãqq, loins, because it was never called al-Marãqq in Arabian astronomy.Al Rishã', the Cord (of the well-bucket), on al-Sũfĩ's star map. It is origin of the proper name Alrescha for Alpha Piscium.Beta Andromedae was sometimes called Umbilicus Andromedae. Later, this name was mistransfered from this star to Alpha Andromedae by Lalande.Cingulum and Ventrale are translated from the Arabic mi'zar.ComponentsThe red giant of spectral class M0 has the multiple star designation WDS 01097+3537A, and has been observed to have a number of visual companions, shown below.
