He became famous for isolating Bacillus anthracis (1877), the tuberculosis bacillus (1882) and the vibrio cholera (1883) and for his development of Koch's postulates.He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his tuberculosis findings in 1905. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology—he inspired such major figures as Paul Ehrlich and Gerhard Domagk.BiographyHeinrich Hermann Robert Koch was born in Clausthal, Germany as the son of a mining official. He studied medicine under Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle at the University of Göttingen and graduated in 1866. He then served in the Franco-Prussian War and later became district medical officer in Wollstein (Wolsztyn), Prussian Poland. Working with very limited resources, he became one of the founders of bacteriology, the other major figure being Louis Pasteur.After Casimir Davaine showed the direct transmission of the anthrax bacillus between cows, Koch studied anthrax more closely. He invented methods to purify the bacillus from blood samples and grow pure cultures. He found that, while it could not survive outside a host for long, anthrax built persisting endospores that could last a long time.These endospores, embedded in soil, were the cause of unexplained "spontaneous" outbreaks of anthrax. Koch published his findings in 1876, and was rewarded with a job at the Imperial Health Office in Berlin in 1880. In 1881, he urged the sterilization of surgical instruments using heat.In Berlin, he improved the methods he used in Wollstein, including staining and purification techniques, and bacterial growth media, including agar plates (thanks to the advice of Angelina and Walther Hesse) and the Petri dish, named after its inventor, his assistant Julius Richard Petri. These devices are still used today. With these techniques, he was able to discover the bacterium causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in 1882 (he announced the discovery on March 24). Tuberculosis was the cause of one in seven deaths in the mid-19th century.In 1883, Koch worked with a French research team in Alexandria, Egypt, studying cholera. Koch identified the vibrio bacterium that caused cholera, though he never managed to prove it in experiments. The bacterium had been previously isolated by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini in 1854, but his work had been ignored due to the predominance of the miasma theory of disease. Koch was unaware of Pacini's work and made an independent discovery, and his greater preeminence allowed the discovery to be widely spread for the benefit of others. In 1965, however, the bacterium was formally renamed Vibrio cholera Pacini 1854.In 1885, he became professor of hygiene at the University of Berlin, then in 1891 he was made Honorary Professor of the medical faculty and Director of the new Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases (eventually renamed as the Robert Koch Institute), a position from which he resigned in 1904. He started traveling around the world, studying diseases in South Africa, India, and Java.Probably as important as his work on tuberculosis, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize (1905), are Koch's postulates, which say that to establish that an organism is the cause of a disease, it must be:found in all cases of the disease examinedprepared and maintained in a pure culturecapable of producing the original infection, even after several generations in cultureretrievable from an inoculated animal and cultured again.After Koch's success the quality of his own research declined (especially with the fiasco over his ineffective TB cure "tuberculin"), although his pupils found the organisms responsible for diphtheria, typhoid, pneumonia, gonorrhoea, cerebrospinal meningitis, leprosy, bubonic plague, tetanus, and syphilis, among others, by using his methods.Koch died on May 27, 1910 from a heart-attack in Baden-Baden, aged 66.Honors and awardsKoch crater on the Moon was named after him. The Robert Koch Prize and Medal were created to honour Microbiologists who make groundbreaking discoveries or who contribute to global health in a unique way. The now-defunct Robert Koch Hospital at Koch, Missouri (south of St. Louis, Missouri), was also named in his honor. A hagiographic account of Koch's career can be found in the 1939 Nazi propaganda film Robert Koch, der Bekämpfer des Todes, directed by Hans Steinhoff and starring Emil Jannings as Koch.See alsoHistory of medicineTimeline of medicine and medical technologyReferencesExternal linksRobert Koch Biography at the Nobel Foundation websiteRobert Koch Biography and bibliography in the Virtual Laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science |PLACE OF BIRTH=Clausthal, Germany |DATE OF DEATH=1910-05-27 |PLACE OF DEATH=Baden-Baden, Germany  Category:Deaths by myocardial infarction Category:German biologists Category:German inventors Category:German microbiologists Category:German military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War Category:German Nobel laureates Category:German physicians Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Category:Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:People from the Kingdom of Hanover Category:Recipients of the Pour le Mérite (civil class) Category:Tuberculosis Category:University of Göttingen alumniaf:Robert Koch ar:روبرت كوخ bn:রবার্ট কখ bs:Robert Koch br:Robert Koch bg:Роберт Кох ca:Robert Koch cs:Robert Koch da:Robert Koch de:Robert Koch et:Robert Koch es:Robert Koch eo:Robert Koch eu:Robert Koch fa:رابرت کخ fr:Robert Koch ga:Robert Koch gd:Robert Koch gl:Robert Koch ko:로베르트 코흐 hr:Robert Koch io:Robert Koch id:Robert Koch it:Robert Koch he:רוברט קוך ka:რობერტ კოხი sw:Robert Koch ku:Robert Koch la:Robertus Koch lb:Robert Koch hu:Robert Koch mk:Роберт Кох nl:Robert Koch ja:ロベルト・コッホ no:Robert Koch nn:Robert Koch oc:Robert Koch pl:Robert Koch pt:Robert Koch ro:Robert Koch qu:Robert Koch ru:Кох, Роберт sk:Robert Koch sl:Robert Koch sr:Роберт Кох fi:Robert Koch sv:Robert Koch ta:ராபர்ட் கோக் te:రాబర్ట్ కోచ్ vi:Robert Koch tr:Robert Koch uk:Роберт Кох zh:羅伯·柯霍
