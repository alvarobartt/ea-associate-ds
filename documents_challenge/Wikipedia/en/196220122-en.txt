He has become a club legend and cult-hero at many of the clubs he has played at. In 1985, Caniggia ran the 100-meters in 10"07 seconds in a South American academic athlete-game, he was one of the fastest footballers in the world.International careerCaniggia was capped 50 times for Argentina, scoring 16 goals. Most of these caps came in the early 1990s. He played at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, scoring 4 goals in 8 matches. Contrary to popular belief and largely due to loose interpretation, Caniggia was not a striker, but rather a playmaker forward. Throughout the Copa América 1991, Caniggia asserted his dominance and was arguably the most dynamic player. He scored 2 goals and made 4 assists in the tournament.To Argentine football fans, Claudio has always been a strange footballer, playing for many different clubs in many different countries, which is why it is impossible to associate him with a single club. Instead he holds a unique place in their affections. Because when they think of El Pajaro, it is always in the "celeste and blanca" colours of the national team. Claudio is synonymous with World Cup games, winning goals and triumphs in the Argentinian jersey. (Citation: Natasha Woods, "Phoenix from the flames; His flight path may have taken him far from", The Sunday Herald, Apr 7, 2002)Caniggia is great friends with Argentine superstar Diego Maradona; the duo once celebrated a goal with a kiss on the lips. Claudio's wife at that time, model Mariana Nannis, said: "At times I believe Diego is in love with my husband. It must be the long hair and big muscles."1990 World CupAt the 1990 World Cup, Caniggia scored two key goals to help Argentina reach the final. He came off the bench in the inaugural match against Cameroon, memorably being fouled thrice in a single dribble as he carried the ball forward, the last, by Benjamin Massing earning the Cameroonian a straight red card (Massing kicked Caniggia so hard his own shoe came off). In the subsequent matches, Caniggia was in the starting lineup. In the round of sixteen, Argentina faced Brazil, and with the score 0-0 after 80 minutes, a pass by Diego Maradona left Caniggia one on one against Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel; Caniggia dribbled past him and scored on the empty goal, giving Argentina the victory and eliminating Brazil from the tournament. The goal gave him legendary status among the Argentine fans for knocking out their chief rivals.Argentina then beat Yugoslavia on penalty kicks, advancing to semifinals, where they played against Italy. The Italians had not allowed any goals in five matches, and were up 1-0 at halftime. In the second half, Caniggia headed a cross into the net of goalkeeper Walter Zenga, ending his record streak at 517 minutes without conceding a goal, and sending the match into extra time. After no change in the score, penalty kicks were taken, and Argentina won again through this method, advancing to the final. Caniggia had been cautioned in one of the first round matches, and then received another yellow card against Italy, which earned him a suspension. He had to watch the final between his team and Germany from the stands, which Argentina lost 0-1.1994 World CupCaniggia scored two goals in the 1994 World Cup, both of them in the first round match against Nigeria, the first from a Batistuta freekick rebound and second one from a cleverly taken free kick by Diego Maradona, which he finished sublimely putting the ball in top right hand corner. This was last match in which Maradona would be involved during his World Cup career and this is still considered one of the best teams Argentina has ever had.Absence from the national teamAfter refusing to cut his long hair despite the rules of national coach Daniel Passarella, he was frozen out of the national team for a number of years. He made a brief comeback to the Marcelo Bielsa-coached squad for the 2002 World Cup, but did not play. Nevertheless, he did manage to receive a red card for cursing at the referee from the bench in Argentina's last match against Sweden.Club Honours River PlatePrimera División Argentina: 1985-86Copa Libertadores: 1986Intercontinental Cup: 1986Copa Interamericana: 1987 Atalanta B.C.Serie B: 1999-00 (Runners-up) A.S.
