 Ayamonte is a town and municipality located in the province of Huelva, Spain. According to the 2005 census, the city has a population of 18,001 inhabitants.The township of Ayamonte preserves its old medieval quarter in the central district of the town, with many very narrow streets and historical buildings; this central area is a designated car-free zone.For centuries the ferry link between Ayamonte and Vila Real de Santo António was the traditional crossing point between Spain and Portugal. A modern bridge over the Guadiana River has now been built to the north of the town, linking the motorway systems of the two countries, but the ferry still runs and provides an inexpensive mode of transport between the two countries.The beach area of Ayamonte is Isla Canela, and is reached by a causeway across the Marismas del Guadiana; the marismas (salt marshes) are an important wildlife reserve, providing a home to many waterfowl, including herons and flamingos. Isla Canela is built along several kilometers of sandy beaches, and provides an ideal area for windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing. There are a number of quality golf courses in and around the area, including one built into the Marismas itself.It is well known as the home of young Spanish idol, María Isabel.Demographics Source: INE (Spain)External linksAyuntamiento de AyamonteAyamonte - Sistema de Información Multiterritorial de AndalucíaCategory:Municipalities in Huelvaca:Ayamonte de:Ayamonte es:Ayamonte eo:Ayamonte eu:Ayamonte fr:Ayamonte it:Ayamonte ht:Ayamonte (Huelva) nl:Ayamonte pl:Ayamonte pt:Ayamonte ru:Айямонте fi:Ayamonte vi:Ayamonte tr:Ayamonte
