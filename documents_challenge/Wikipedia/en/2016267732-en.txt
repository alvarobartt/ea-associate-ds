It was founded on April 5, 1877, by Hermann Blohm and Ernst Voss as a general partnership named Blohm & Voss. A shipyard was built on the island of Kuhwerder, near the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, covering 15,000 m² with 250 m of water frontage and three building berths, two suitable for ships of up to 100 metres length. The company's logo is a simple dark blue rectangle with rounded corners bearing the white letters "Blohm+Voss".The company has continued to build ships and other large machines for 125 years. Despite being almost completely demolished after the end of World War II, it now builds warships both for the Deutsche Marine and for export (see MEKO), as well as oil drilling equipment and ships for numerous commercial customers.From about 1930 to 1945 Blohm & Voss also designed and built aircraft for use by both the German state airline, Lufthansa, and the air-force, Luftwaffe. Particularly noteworthy were the large flying boats the company produced, as well as ingenious approaches to aircraft building that often featured asymmetric designs. Although the aviation arm was originally known as Hamburger Flugzeugbau and their aircraft bore the designation "Ha", this quickly fell from use and newer designs received "BV" instead.From July 1944 to April 1945 Blohm & Voss used inmates of its own Nazi concentration subcamp at its shipyard in Hamburg-Steinwerder. The camp was a subcamp to the Neuengamme concentration camp. The camp Blohm & Voss is listed as No. 550 Hamburg in the official German list (List in German)Until 1955 the company name was Blohm & Voss.The company's name is often found spelled Blohm + Voß in German (and occasionally English) sources.See ß for an explanation of the use of this letter and changes in German spelling that have taken place over the last century with regard to its use. Today Blohm + Voss is (along with Howaldtswerke at Kiel and Nordseewerke at Emden) a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.Ships and submarinesNotable ships built by Blohm + Voss include:Tall ships:Petschili (1903), Pamir (1905), Passat (1911), Peking (1911), Pola (1916), Priwall (1917), and other Flying P-LinersThe three-mast barques and school ships of the Gorch Fock classOcean liners and other passenger ships:SS EuropaSS Cap Arcona sunk with great loss of life near the end of World War IIWilhelm Gustloff, currently the world's worst maritime disaster when she was sunk near the end of WWIIM/V Explorer, the ship currently used by the Semester at Sea university study abroad programPrinzessin Victoria Luise first vessel built, for Hamburg-America Line, exclusively for cruisingPrivate yachts:Savarona - built for an American heiress in 1931.

Although initially given the factory code Ha (for the factory's official name), the link with Blohm & Voss shipyards proved too strong and therefore the early aircraft designs were called "Blohm & Voss, type Ha..." followed by the design number. To end this confusion, in 1938 the Reichsluftfartministerium gave in to the unavoidable and changed the company code to BV.Aircraft designed under the Ha and BV designations include:Blohm &amp; Voss BV 40, glider interceptorBlohm &amp; Voss Ha 137, prototype dive bomberBlohm &amp; Voss BV 138, military patrol flying-boat (early versions designated as Ha 138)Blohm &amp; Voss Ha 139, long-range seaplaneBlohm &amp; Voss Ha 140, torpedo bomber flying-boat (prototype)Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141, reconnaissance (asymmetric)Blohm &amp; Voss BV 142, reconnaissance + transportBlohm &amp; Voss BV 143, glide bomb (prototype)Blohm &amp; Voss BV 144, transportBlohm &amp; Voss BV 155, high-altitude interceptor (formerly Me 155)Blohm &amp; Voss BV 222 Wiking (Viking), transport flying-boatBlohm &amp; Voss BV 238, flying-boat (prototype)Blohm &amp; Voss BV 246 Hagelkorn (Hailstone), long-range radar-homing glide bombAlthough Hamburger Flugzeugbau re-emerged after the war and, under different names and ownerships, continued to build aircraft until the present day, this company has no more ties to the Blohm & Voss shipyards.ReferencesNotesBibliographyMeyhoff, Andreas.
