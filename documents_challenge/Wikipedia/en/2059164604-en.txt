Playing either as a striker or an attacking midfielder, Tomasson is known for his positional strength and fine finishing. His most notable run of football came in his years at Dutch club Feyenoord, with whom he won the 2002 UEFA Cup, and Italian club AC Milan, with whom he won the 2003 UEFA Champions League. He was given the 2002 and 2004 [[Danish Football Player of the Year|Danish Player of the Year]] award.He has scored 51 goals in 102 matches for the Denmark national football team, making him the second most scoring player in Danish national team history. He represented Denmark in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, scoring four goals, as well as in two European Championship tournaments.Playing careerBorn in Roskilde, Tomasson first started playing football as a five year-old in the youth team of Solrød BK near Køge. At nine years of age, he moved to the biggest club in the area; Køge BK. He made his senior debut for the club in 1992, and helped the club move from the lower league Denmark Series to the Danish 2nd Division; from the fifth to the third tier of Danish football. He was considered a great talent in Danish football, as he played for various Danish youth national teams. He scored 10 goals in 16 games for the national under-19 team, and was awarded 1994 Danish u-19 Player of the Year. In all, he scored 27 goals in 37 matches for various national youth selections.Early careerIn December 1994, aged 18, he moved to the Netherlands, when he signed his first professional contract with the Dutch club SC Heerenveen in the top-flight Eredivisie championship. A first-team regular by the 1995-96 season, Tomasson was the club top scorer for the season as well, netting 14 goals in 30 league matches. He increased this tally in the 1996-97 season to 18, and was top-scorer for the club once again. The two good seasons with Heerenveen resulted in Tomasson getting a call-up to the Denmark national team, and he made his debut on March 29, 1997, against Croatia.His success attracted the interest of other clubs, and he completed a high profile move to the English FA Premier League club Newcastle United in 1997. At Newcastle, Tomasson was moved from his attacking midfielder position to the role of striker, but his lack of physical strength fell short in the Newcastle strategy of long passes.WORLD CUP Squad Jon Dahl Tomasson, BBC Sport, April 8, 2002Kristine Wilkens, "Jon Dahl tilbage på vant plads", Berlingske Tidende, June 20, 1998 He was unable to make an impact at the club, scoring only 3 goals in 23 appearances. During his time at Newcastle, reduced playing time saw Tomasson dropped by the Danish national team, and he was not selected to play at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.UEFA Cup triumphHe returned to the Eredivisie in July 1998, where he joined Feyenoord and once again took the position of attacking midfielder. His first season there, the 1998-99 season, turned out successfully for the club, as they won the Eredivisie championship, as well as the Dutch Super Cup. Tomasson was once more called up for the Danish national team, and with 6 goals in 7 matches of the Euro 2000 qualification, he quickly became an important part of the Danish team, playing as an attacking midfielder behind striker Ebbe Sand. He played in all Denmark's three matches at the main Euro 2000 tournament, but did not score as Denmark were eliminated in the group stage.In 2002, Tomasson was an integral player in the Feyenoord team that won its first international trophy in 26 years, when the club triumphed in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup tournament. He and towering striker Pierre van Hooijdonk formed an attacking duo that defeated SC Freiburg, PSV Eindhoven and Internazionale Milano before meeting German team Borussia Dortmund in the final. Tomasson scored the goal to 3-1, in a game that ended 3-2 to Feyenoord, and he was subsequently voted man of the match.Feyenoord boost Dutch, BBC Sport, May 8, 2002 In the Summer 2002, Tomasson's contract with Feyenoord was expiring, and after their UEFA Cup victory, he agreed a move to Italy on a free transfer to play for Serie A club AC Milan. Before moving to Milan, he played for Denmark in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he scored four goals in as many games.AC MilanThe 2002-03 season, Tomasson's first at Milan, saw them winning the Italian Cup. Tomasson was most often used as a late substitute, but did manage to score three goals in the UEFA Champions League, as AC Milan won the prestigious tournament. In the next season, they then won the Italian Super Cup. Tomasson was given more playing time, as he scored 12 goals in AC Milan's Serie A title winning 2003-04 season. Tomasson played for Denmark in the Euro 2004, where he scored three goals in four games and was selected for the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship#UEFA Team of the Tournament|Euro 2004 Team of the Tournament]].Struggling to secure a place in AC Milan's starting line-up, he was once again in the role of substitute, and struggled to score goals. He was used as a late substitute in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final against Liverpool FC, which was to be decided in penalty shootout. Tomasson scored on his attempt, but AC Milan lost as Serginho, Andrea Pirlo and Andriy Shevchenko missed their shots. Tomasson was deemed surplus when striker Christian Vieri joined the club in July 2005. He left Milan to join German side VfB Stuttgart in the German Bundesliga championship.VfB Stuttgart and Villarreal CFAt Stuttgart, Tomasson joined fellow Danish national team player Jesper Grønkjær for the 2005-06 season, but the season was not successful for either of them. Even though Tomasson managed to create goals by himself, the team struggled to create chances,Tomasson hands Trapattoni a lifeline, Soccernet, October 21, 2005 and the club finished in 9th position. After the season, Grønkjær left the club, while Tomasson was linked with a switch to English club Birmingham City in the Summer transfer window of 2006. He stayed at Stuttgart, but had to see himself relegated to a place on the substitutes' bench.On January 24, 2007, Tomasson was loaned to Villarreal in the Spanish Primera División championship, to cover the place of the injured striker Nihat Kahveci.  When he made his Villarreal debut as a substitute against Real Madrid,  Tomasson became only the fifth player to have played in the Premier League, Serie A, the Bundesliga and Primera División.Striker Tomasson heading to Villareal on loan, Soccernet, January 24, 2007 (the first four players being Florin Răducioiu, Gheorghe Popescu, Abel Xavier and Pierre Wome)When his loan contract in Villarreal expired on July 1, 2007 he was part of the reserve team of VfB Stuttgart in the Regionalliga. On July 10, 2007 he returned to Villareal on a permanent deal. In the first match of La Liga season 2007/08, Jon Dahl scored in Villareal's 3-0 victory against Valencia at Mestalla. That goal was one of only three in the 2007/08 La Liga, where he also struggled to get a place in the first team.Return to FeyenoordAs a result of a rather disappointing season at Villarreal he was put on the transfer list at the end of the season. He was linked with Dutch side Feyenoord in the Spanish sportspaper Marca, but the transfer was denied by the Danish footballerJon Dahl kender ikke til Feyenoord-rygter, Bold.dk, 25 June, 2008. The speculations, however, turned out to be true, and on July 2 2008, he returned to Feyenoord after personally requesting a free transfer signing a three-year contract with the Dutch sideJon Dahl Tomasson returning to De Kuip, Feyenoord.com, 2 July, 2008. He got off to a great start with 4 goals in 3 games, 3 of them being penalties.Career statistics  |- |1991-92||rowspan="3"|Køge||rowspan="3"|Superliga||2||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1992-93||20||10|||||||||||||||| |- |1993-94||33||27||||||||||||||||  |- |1994-95||rowspan="3"|Heerenveen||rowspan="3"|Eredivisie||16||5|||||||||||||||| |- |1995-96||30||14|||||||||||||||| |- |1996-97||32||18||||||||||||||||  |- |1997-98||Newcastle United||Premier League||23||3||||||||||||||||  |- |1998-99||rowspan="4"|Feyenoord||rowspan="4"|Eredivisie||33||13|||||||||||||||| |- |1999-00||28||10|||||||||||||||| |- |2000-01||33||13|||||||||||||||| |- |2001-02||30||17||||||||||||||||  |- |2002-03||rowspan="3"|Milan||rowspan="3"|Serie A||20||4|||||||||||||||| |- |2003-04||26||12|||||||||||||||| |- |2004-05||30||6||||||||||||||||  |- |2005-06||rowspan="2"|Stuttgart||rowspan="2"|Bundesliga||26||8|||||||||||||||| |- |2006-07||5||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2006-07||rowspan="2"|Villarreal||rowspan="2"|La Liga||10||4|||||||||||||||| |- |2007-08||||||||||||||||||||  |- |2008-09||Feyenoord||Eredivisie||3||4|||||||||||||||| 55||37|||||||||||||||| 203||92|||||||||||||||| 23||3|||||||||||||||| 76||22|||||||||||||||| 31||8|||||||||||||||| 36||7|||||||||||||||| 419||170|||||||||||||||| |International goalsWith 51 goals at the Danish national team Tomasson is second only to Poul &quot;Tist&quot;
