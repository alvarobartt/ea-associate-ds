 MeshID         = D003398 | Craniosynostosis,&lt;/ref&gt; is a medical condition in which some or all of the [[cranial sutures|suture]]s in the [[skull]] of an [[infant]] or child close too early, causing problems with normal [[human brain|brain]] and skull growth....... It can result in craniostenosis, which is the skull deformity caused by the premature closure of the cranial sutures. Also [[intracranial pressure]] can be increased.   Normal skull developmentIn humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 28 bones. The flat bones making up the cranial vault are joined together by sutures: rigid articulations permitting very little movement.At birth, the human skull is made up of 45 separate bony elements. As growth occurs, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the frontal bones).The bones of the roof of the skull are initially separated by regions of dense connective tissue. At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. Larger regions of connective tissue, called fontanelles, occur where certain bony elements meet. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanelle can remain up to eighteen months.PathophysiologyWhen one or more sutures fuse prematurely, skull growth can be restricted perpendicular to the suture. If multiple sutures fuse while the brain is still increasing in size, intracranial pressure can increase.Primary craniosynostosis is believed to be a result of primary defect in the mesenchymal layer ossification in the cranial bones. Secondary craniosynostosis is a result of primary failure of brain growth.DiagnosisPhysicians diagnose craniosynostosis through physical examination, plain x-rays, and CT scans. &lt;/ref&gt;SyndromesCraniosynostosis often occurs alone, however about 20% of cases are associated with syndromes. A syndrome is diagnosed by considering the presence of a variety of features, signs, and symptoms throughout the body. Genetic testing may be available to confirm the diagnosis of a specific syndrome. A family history of abnormal head shape can sometimes be found with genetic syndromes, though many syndromes are caused by new genetic mutations, and there is no family history of the disorder. The most common causes of syndromic craniosynostosis are Crouzon syndrome and Apert syndrome. However, there are over 150 syndromes associated with craniosynostosis.  The following table lists some of the craniosynostosis syndromes, as well as prominent additional symptoms that are found in these syndromes — this is not a comprehensive list of all symptoms that could occur within each syndrome. There is considerable overlap of symptoms between many of these syndromes, and clinical evaluation by a geneticist may be necessary to determine the most appropriate diagnosis.Name of syndromeOther signs and symptoms (along with craniosynostosis; may not all be present)OMIM referenceGeneCrouzon syndromewide-set, bulging eyes • beaked nose • flat face123500FGFR2, FGFR3Apert syndromefused fingers or toes • flat midface101200FGFR2Crouzonodermoskeletal syndromewide-set, bulging eyes • beaked nose • flat face • dark, velvety skin folds • spine abnormalities • benign growths in the jaw134934FGFR3Jackson-Weiss syndromeenlarged, bent big toes • flat midface123150FGFR1, FGFR2Loeys-Dietz syndromewide-set eyes • split uvula or cleft palate • arterial tortuosity • aneurysms609192TGFBR1Muenke syndromecoronal synostosis • skeletal abnormalities of the hands or feet • hearing loss602849FGFR3Pfeiffer syndromebroad, short thumbs or big toes • webbed or fused fingers or toes101600FGFR1, FGFR2Saethre-Chotzen syndromefacial asymmetry • low frontal hairline • drooping eyelids • webbed fingers or toes • broad big toes101400TWIST1Shprintzen-Goldberg syndromebulging eyes • flat face • hernias • long, thin fingers • developmental delay • mental retardation182212FBN1Differential diagnosisA separate cause of abnormal head shape is positional plagiocephaly — flattened or misshapen areas on the head that may develop due to sleeping position. While the appearance may look rather similar to craniosynostosis, the distinction is important. Positional plagiocephaly does not require surgery — treatment can be as simple as occasionally repositioning the child's head while sleeping or, in some cases, wearing a cranial band to mold the skull.  It has recently been discovered that using certain prescription drugs during pregnancy may lead to this disorder. (sertraline) TreatmentSurgery is typically used to separate the fused sutures of the skull as well as to reshape the skull. To treat the cosmetic troubles, a combination of orthodontic and orthognathic surgery can be used to relieve some of the midface deficiency.Typical surgery begins with a zigzag incision from ear to ear across the top of the head. The scar left by this type of incision makes the hair look more natural than that left by a straight incision would. Leroy clips are typically used to curtail bleeding, as cauterization would not result in an aesthetically pleasing result upon healing. Once the scalp is peeled back, pilot holes are drilled through the skull. These pilot holes are then connected, separating the skull into several pieces. Once reshaped, these pieces are placed back on the head (typically in an altered configuration) and held together by a combination of dissolving sutures, plates, and screws. These plates and screws are typically composed of a copolymer comprised of polyglycolic and polylactic acid and will break down into water and carbon dioxide within a year. Demineralized bone matrix or bone morphogenetic proteins are often used to fill gaps left by the expanded skull, encouraging the body to grow new bone in a process called intramembranous ossification. Once the hemostatic scalp clips are removed, sutures are again used to close the incision.Newer approaches include minimally invasive endoscopic assisted removal of the closed suture followed by treatment with custom made molding helmets. These surgeries are associated with significantly less blood loss, swelling, hospital length of stay and pain. The results have been excellent in the majority of patients treated this way. Endoscopic surgery, however, is indicated only for very young infants(External linkshttp://cappskids.org/board/index.php?s= Craniosynostosis support group - parents of children with Craniosynostosishttp://cappskids.org/ Craniosynostosis support groupHeadlines Support Group — British based support group for CraniosynostosisOverview of craniosynostosis from Children's Hospital BostonCraniosynostosis — comprehensive overview (American Family Physician)Single Suture Craniosynostoses (The Craniofacial Center in Dallas, Texas)Cranio Kids — craniosynostosis supportAn adult survivor's perspectivePhoto Gallery Results of less invasive craniosynostosis procedure performed at University Health System, San Antonio, TXCranio Support Web Page - Midwest Craniosynostosis story and support web pageGrupo de padres de niños con craneosinostosis - Web site in spanish about craniosinotosisCategory:Skeletal disorders Category:Pediatrics Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgeryde:Kraniosynostose es:Craneosinostosis fr:Craniosynostose nl:Craniosynostose pl:Kraniosynostoza
