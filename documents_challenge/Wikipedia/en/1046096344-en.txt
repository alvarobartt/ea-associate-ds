The genus Heuchera includes at least 50 species of herbaceous perennial plants in the family Saxifragaceae, all native to North America. Common names include alumroot and coral bells. They have palmately lobed leaves on long petioles, and a thick, woody rootstock. The genus was named after Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677–1746), an 18th century German physician.Alumroot species grow in varied habitats, so some species look quite different from one another, and have varying preferences regarding temperature, soil, and other natural factors. H. maxima is found on the Channel Islands of California, where it grows on rocky, windy, saline-washed ocean shores. H. sanguinea, called coral bells because of its terra cotta-colored flowers, can be found in the warm, dry canyons of Arizona. Gardeners and horticulturists have developed a multitude of hybrids between various Heuchera species. There is an extensive array of blossom sizes, shapes, and colors, foliage types, and geographic tolerances.Food and medicinal usesThough tangy and slightly astringent, the leaves may be used to liven up bland greens.Natives of the Northwest U.S. have used tonic derived of Alumroot roots to aid digestive difficulties, but extractions from the root can also be used to stop minor bleeding, reduce inflammation, and otherwise shrink moist tissues after swelling.Selected speciesHeuchera abramsii - San Gabriel AlumrootHeuchera alpestris - San Bernardino AlumrootHeuchera americana - American AlumrootHeuchera brevistaminea - Laguna Mountain AlumrootHeuchera brizoidesHeuchera cespitosa - Tufted AlumrootHeuchera chlorantha - Green-flowered AlumrootHeuchera cylindricaHeuchera duranii - Duran's AlumrootHeuchera elegans - Urnflower AlumrootHeuchera hirsutissima - Shaggy-haired AlumrootHeuchera maxima - Island Alumroot, Jill-of-the-RocksHeuchera merriamii - Merriam's AlumrootHeuchera micrantha - Crevice Alumroot, Smallflower AlumrootHeuchera parishii - Mill Creek AlumrootHeuchera parvifoliaHeuchera pilosissima - Seaside AlumrootHeuchera pulchella - Sandia AlumrootHeuchera rubescensHeuchera sanguinea - Coral BellsHeuchera villosa - Hairy AlumrootHeuchera wootonii - Wooton's AlumrootGallery Image:Heuchera 1.jpg|Heuchera x brizoides Image:Greenspice.jpg|Heuchera americana 'Green Spice' Image:Heuchera Starry Night garden show.jpg|Heuchera 'Starry Night' External links[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?7088,7101 Jepson Manual genus Heuchera]Category:Saxifragaceae Category:Flora of California Category:Plants named after peoplede:Purpurglöckchen es:Heuchera fr:Heuchera nl:Heuchera pl:Żurawka (roślina) pt:Heuchera
