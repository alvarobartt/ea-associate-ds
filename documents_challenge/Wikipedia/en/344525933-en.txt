 County Offaly () is a county in Leinster, Ireland, bordered by seven other counties: Galway, Roscommon, Westmeath, Meath, Kildare, Laois, and Tipperary. Originally the name referred to the Kingdom of Uí Failghe. The present county was shired in 1556 by Mary I of England during one of the Plantations of Ireland, and was then named King's County after King Philip II of Spain, and the county town was Philipstown (now called Daingean) until the nineteenth century. The county town is now Tullamore. Its former name of "King's County" is still used when the title deeds to a property are transferred from a buyer to a seller today.HistoryBefore the plantation of modern day Offaly by English settlers, the territories it comprises were controlled principally by the Ó Conchubhair Fáilghe clan in the North/East of the county and the Ó Céarbhaill of Ely in the south. The county was shired in 1556 from some of the remnant Gaelic captaincys on the borderlands of the ancient kingdoms of Meath, Munster and Leinster and therefore does not correspond to the territory of the Kingdom of Uí Failghe. Its former name of "King's County" derived from Philip, the consort of Queen Mary I, who later ruled as Philip II of Spain. As a result Daingean was formerly known as Philipstown. The county was renamed in 1922 after the Irish War of Independence.GeographyThe southern part of the county is occupied by the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the northwestern part is the floodplain of the River Shannon and the remainder consists of large bogs including the Bog of Allen and Boora Bog.Towns and villagesTullamore (County Town)Ballinagar, Ballyboy, Banagher, BirrCadamstown, Clara, Cloghan, Clonygowan, Clonbullogue Clonmacnoise, Crinkill, CroghanDaingean, DunkerrinEdenderryFerbaneGeashillHorseleapKilcormac, Killeigh, Killoughey, KinnittyMoneygall, MountbolusPortarlington (half of which is in County Laois, the River Barrow forming the county boundary)Rahan, RhodeShannonbridge, Shannon Harbour, ShinroneWalsh IslandDemographicsThe population of County Offaly has grown as follows since 1961:1961 ... 51,5331971 ... 51,829 ... +0.57%1981 ... 58,312 ... +12.51%1986 ... 59,835 ... +2.60%1991 ... 58,494 ... -2.24%1996 ... 59,117 ... +1.07%2002 ... 63,663 ... +7.7%2006 ... 70,868 ... +11.3%The 2006 figure is the highest population figure for the county since 1881.

Offaly’s population growth during the period 2002-2006 (11.3%) has been stronger than the National average (8.2%). This may be attributed to proximity to the Greater Dublin Area, recent increased accessibility to Dublin (M6, M7, and improved rail services) and the differential in house prices between Dublin and Offaly.The population of many towns has risen dramatically over the period 1996 to 2006: Birr +21.5%, Tullamore +28.8% and Edenderry +53.9%.
