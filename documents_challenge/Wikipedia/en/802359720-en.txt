Apache was the first viable alternative to the Netscape Communications Corporation web server (currently known as Sun Java System Web Server), and has since evolved to rival other Unix-based web servers in terms of functionality and performance.Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation. The application is available for a wide variety of operating systems, including Unix, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Novell NetWare, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, OS/2, TPF, and eComStation. Released under the Apache License, Apache is characterized as free software and open source software.Since April 1996 Apache has been the most popular HTTP server on the World Wide Web.  Apache served 49.12% of all websites.History and NameThe first version of the Apache web server was created by Robert McCool, who was heavily involved with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications web server, known simply as NCSA HTTPd. When McCool left NCSA in mid-1994, the development of httpd stalled, leaving a variety of patches for improvements circulating through e-mails. These patches were provided by a number of other developers besides McCool: Brian Behlendorf, Roy Fielding, Rob Hartill, David Robinson, Cliff Skolnick, Randy Terbush, Robert S. Thau, Andrew Wilson, Eric Hagberg, Frank Peters and Nicolas Pioch, and they thus helped to form the original "Apache Group".There have been two explanations of the project's name. According to the Apache Foundation, the name was chosen out of respect for the Native American Indian tribe of Apache (Indé), well-known for their endurance and their skills in warfare. However, the original FAQ on the Apache Server project's website, from 1996 to 2001, claimed that "The result after combining NCSA httpd patches was A 'PA't'CH'y server. The first explanation was supported at an Apache Conference  and in an interview in 2000 by Brian Behlendorf, who said that the name connoted "Take no prisoners. Be kind of aggressive and kick some ass". Behlendorf then contradicted this in a 2007 interview, stating that "The Apache server isn't named in honor of Geronimo's tribe" but that so many revisions were sent in that "the group called it 'a patchy Web server'". Both explanations are probably appropriate  though the pun explanation has fallen into disfavor.Version 2 of the Apache server was a substantial re-write of much of the Apache 1.x code, with a strong focus on further modularization and the development of a portability layer, the Apache Portable Runtime. The Apache 2.x core has several major enhancements over Apache 1.x. These include UNIX threading, better support for non-Unix platforms (such as Microsoft Windows), a new Apache API, and IPv6 support. &lt;/ref&gt; The first alpha release of Apache 2 was in March 2000, with the first general availability release on 6 April 2002.Version 2.2 introduced a more flexible authorization API. It also features improved cache modules and proxy modules.&lt;/ref&gt;FeaturesApache supports a variety of features, many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality. These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes. Some common language interfaces support mod_perl, mod_python, Tcl, and PHP. Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, and mod_digest. A sample of other features include SSL and TLS support (mod_ssl), a proxy module, a useful URL rewriter (also known as a rewrite engine, implemented under mod_rewrite), custom log files (mod_log_config), and filtering support (mod_include and mod_ext_filter).Popular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module, mod_gzip, implemented to help with reduction of the size (weight) of web pages served over HTTP. Apache logs can be analyzed through a web browser using free scripts such as AWStats/W3Perl or Visitors.Virtual hosting allows one Apache installation to serve many different actual websites. For example, one machine, with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve www.example.com, www.test.com, test47.test-server.test.com, etc.Apache features configurable error messages, DBMS-based authentication databases, and content negotiation. It is also supported by several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which permit easier, more intuitive configuration of the server.UsageApache is primarily used to serve both static content and dynamic Web pages on the World Wide Web. Many web applications are designed expecting the environment and features that Apache provides.Apache is the web server component of the popular LAMP web server application stack, alongside MySQL, and the PHP/Perl/Python (and now also Ruby) programming languages.Apache is redistributed as part of various proprietary software packages including the Oracle Database or the IBM WebSphere application server. Mac OS X integrates Apache as its built-in web server and as support for its WebObjects application server. It is also supported in some way by Borland in the Kylix and Delphi development tools. Apache is included with Novell NetWare 6.5, where it is the default web server.Apache is used for many other tasks where content needs to be made available in a secure and reliable way. One example is sharing files from a personal computer over the Internet. A user who has Apache installed on their desktop can put arbitrary files in the Apache's document root which can then be shared.Programmers developing web applications often use a locally installed version of Apache in order to preview and test code as it is being developed.Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is the main competitor to Apache, trailed by Sun Microsystems' Sun Java System Web Server and a host of other applications such as Zeus Web Server. Some of the biggest web sites in the world are run using Apache. Google's search engine front end is based on a modified version of Apache, named Google Web Server (GWS). Several Wikimedia projects also run on Apache servers .LicenseThe software license under which software from the Apache Foundation is distributed is a distinctive part of the Apache HTTP Server's history and presence in the open source software community. The Apache License allows for the distribution of both open and closed source derivations of the source code.The Free Software Foundation does not consider the Apache License to be compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) in that software licensed under the Apache License cannot be integrated with software that is distributed under the GPL: However, version 3 of the GPL includes a provision (Section 7e) which allows it to be compatible with licenses that have patent retaliation clauses, including the Apache License.The name Apache is a registered trademark and may only be used with the trademark holder's express permission.See alsoComparison of web servers.htaccessXAMPPStronghold (software)ApacheBenchPOSSE projectReferencesExternal linksProject home pageCategory:1996 software Category:Unix software HTTP Server Category:Free web server software Category:Cross-platform softwarear:أباتشي (خادم وب) bs:Apache HTTP server bg:Apache ca:Servidor HTTP Apache cs:Apache HTTP Server da:Apache (webserver) de:Apache HTTP Server el:Apache HTTP εξυπηρετητής es:Servidor HTTP Apache eo:Retservilo Apache eu:Apache HTTP zerbitzaria fa:آپاچی (نرم‌افزار) fr:Apache HTTP Server gl:Apache (servidor web) ko:아파치 웹 서버 hr:Apache HTTP poslužitelj id:Apache HTTP Server ia:Apache HTTP Servitor it:Apache HTTP Server he:Apache HTTP Server lv:Apache HTTP serveris lt:Apache HTTP serveris hu:Apache HTTP Server nl:Apache (webserver) ja:Apache HTTP Server no:Apache (webserver) nn:Apache uz:Apache Server km:Apache HTTP Server pl:Apache (serwer) pt:Servidor Apache ro:Apache ru:Apache simple:Apache HTTP Server sk:Apache HTTP Server sl:Spletni strežnik Apache sr:Veb server Apač su:Apache HTTP Server fi:Apache (palvelinohjelma) sv:Apache HTTP Server ta:அப்பாச்சி இணைய வழங்கி th:อะแพชี เว็บเซิร์ฟเวอร์ vi:Apache (HTTP) tr:Apache HTTP Sunucusu uk:Apache zh:Apache
