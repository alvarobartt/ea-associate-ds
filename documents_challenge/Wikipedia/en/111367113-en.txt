It reached the top three of the charts in both the United States and United Kingdom (after the re-release, it reached #2 in UK) and features the worldwide number-one hits "Whenever, Wherever" and "Underneath Your Clothes". Shakira supported the album with the "Tour of the Mongoose".Production historyAfter the success of the ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? and MTV Unplugged albums, Shakira decided to begin working on a crossover album to break into the English market in 2000. Laundry Service was originally designed to include older songs. However, Shakira later decided against using translations of older songs for the album and worked for over a year on new material for the album.Just months after its announcement, the album was mainly produced by Shakira herself, Tim Mitchell and Lester Mendez who produced a bulk of tracks on the album. Shakira recorded the album in in Miami, Florida and Nassau, Bahamas at the Compass Point Studios. She worked with several other notable producers: Glen Ballard and Luis F. Ochoa.The album has yielded eight singles: "Whenever, Wherever", "Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)", "Te Dejo Madrid", "Underneath Your Clothes", "Objection (Tango)", "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)", "The One", and "Que Me Quedes Tú". "Fool" was released as a single only in Brazil, and "Poem To A Horse" which was released as the main-single from her 2004 tour album Live &amp; Off the Record. The album became a world-wide hit selling more than 13 million copies.Release and receptionSome critics criticized the effectiveness of Shakira's lyrics, claiming that her English skills were too weak for her to write in that language. Most notably, Rolling Stone magazine said about the album that "she sounds downright silly" and that "Shakira's magic is lost in translation", but nearly all agreed on her unique poetic imagery. Laundry Service was released in the United States on November 13, 2001. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 album chart with first week sales of over 202,000, exceeding expectations by a wide margin.Garth's 'Scarecrow' Shoots Straight To No. 1 Billboard magazine.

Thus, "Objection (Tango)" was born, a song that documents Shakira's anger at a relationship in which her lover is unfaithful. It was Shakira's first song composed in English. All the songs on album are original, with the exception of "Eyes Like Yours", which is a translation of Shakira's Arabic-tinged 1999 worldwide hit Ojos Así. Although it is an English album, it did contain four Spanish tracks.In 2002, Sony BMG stated the re-release of the album which was titled Laundry Service: Washed &amp; Dried.
