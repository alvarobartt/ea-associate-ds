He grew up in Benton, Illinois, in a large house on South Main Street. His father, Daniel Malkovich, was a state conservation director and publisher of Outdoor Illinois, a conservation magazine. His mother, Joanne, owned the "Benton Evening News" (a local newspaper in Benton), as well as Outdoor Illinois. Because of his father's work, the Malkovich family is widely acknowledged as one of the founding families of the environmental movement in Illinois. He was an athlete in high school. He transferred to Illinois State University from Eastern Illinois University, where he only spent one semester with an interest in ecology, but he soon changed his major to Theatre.Career In 1976, Malkovich became a charter member of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to New York City, New York in 1983 and appeared in the play True West. He appeared on Broadway with Dustin Hoffman in Death of a Salesman (1984). Malkovich won an Emmy Award for this role when the play became a television movie. One of his first forays into film was as an extra alongside Terry Kinney, George Wendt, Joan Allen, and Laurie Metcalf in Robert Altman's A Wedding (1978). He made his film debut in Places in the Heart (1984) for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In 1994, he was nominated for another Oscar in the same category for In the Line of Fire (1993). Though he played the title role in the Charlie Kaufman-penned Being John Malkovich, he is playing a slight variation of himself, as indicated by the character's middle name of "Horatio". Malkovich has a cameo in the movie Adaptation.&mdash;also written by Kaufman&mdash;appearing as himself during the filming of Being John Malkovich. The Dancer Upstairs, Malkovich's directorial debut, was released in 2002.John Malkovich was considered to join the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation after William Petersen aka Gil Grissom leaves in the next series.Personal lifeMalkovich was married to actress Glenne Headly, from 1982 to 1988. They divorced and Malkovich briefly dated Michelle Pfeiffer, his co-star in Dangerous Liaisons. He later met his long-term partner Nicoletta Peyran on the set of The Sheltering Sky in 1989. They have two children; Amandine (born 1990) and Lowry (born 1992). He is fluent in French and for nearly 10 years, Malkovich lived and worked in the theatre in southern France. In an interview on The Late Show With David Letterman, Malkovich said he had just spent five weeks in the Summer of 2008 living in France.September 5, 2008 Letterman show Since 2003 he has also lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Of the many people he has worked with, Malkovich is often associated with Gary Sinise, a fellow Steppenwolf Theatre Company alum. Joan Allen was a fellow drama student at Eastern Illinois University whom Malkovich brought into Steppenwolf. He met actor John Mahoney in a Chicago acting class years later, and advised him to join Steppenwolf.On April 4, 2005, while speaking at Illinois State University, Malkovich was awarded a diploma in theatre. When attending the university as a student in the 1970s, he failed to take his last remaining graduation requirement, the U.S. Constitution test. This requirement was waived in order to award him the diploma.Political viewsPolitically, Malkovich has described himself as a Libertarian. He is a supporter of the death penalty. When the serial killer John Wayne Gacy was executed in 1994, Malkovich organized a champagne party for himself and his friends. Actor William Hootkins, who worked with Malkovich in BBC television's Rocket to the Moon, stated, "In fact, he's so right-wing you have to wonder if he's kidding." In the United Kingdom in 2002 at the Cambridge Union Society, when asked whom he would most like to "fight to the death," he replied that he would "rather just shoot" journalist Robert Fisk and British MP George Galloway. Fisk reacted with outrage. When interviewed by The Observer, Malkovich elaborated on his comments: "I hate somebody who is supposed to be a Middle Eastern expert who thinks Jesus was born in Jerusalem. I hate what I consider his vile anti-semitism. This being said, I apologize to both Fisk and Galloway; they seem like good men but if they make such a heinous mistake again, I will not hesitate to murder them brutally by way of the gallows". Malkovich then added: "I'm a Christopher Hitchens fan myself, but no one has thinner skins than journalists, in my experience, and I come from a family of them... They can dish it out but they can't take it. But the reason I don't like the topic, why I don't really say anything about a whiner like Fisk, is it gives them more oxygen."FilmographyYearTitleRoleNotes1984Places in the HeartMr. WillAcademy Award nominationThe Killing Fields]]''Al RockoffTrue West]]''Lee1985Death of a Salesman]]''Biff Loman(Made for Television)Eleni]]''Nick Gage1986Rocket to the MoonBen Stark(Made for Television)1987The Glass MenagerieTom WingfieldMaking Mr. RightDr. Jeff Peters/UlyssesEmpire of the Sun]]''Basie1988Miles from HomeBarry MaxwellDangerous LiaisonsVicomte Sébastien de Valmont1990The Sheltering SkyPort Moresby1991Old Times]]''Deeley(Made for Television)The Object of BeautyJakeQueens LogicElliot1992Shadows and FogClownOf Mice and Men]]''Lennie SmallJennifer EightAgent St. Anne1993In the Line of FireMitch LearyAcademy Award nominationAlive]]''Old Carlitos1994Heart of Darkness]]''Kurtz]](Made for Television)1995O ConventoMichael(voice only)1996Mary Reilly]]Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward HydeThe Portrait of a Lady]]''Gilbert OsmondThe Ogre]]''Abel Tiffauges1997Con AirCyrus 'The Virus' Grissom1998The Man in the Iron Mask]]''Athos]]Rounders]]''Teddy KGB1999Being John MalkovichJohn Horatio MalkovichThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of ArcCharles VII]]2000Shadow of the VampireF.W.
