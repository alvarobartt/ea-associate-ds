His father created him 11th Duke of Braganza.After the 1653 death of his eldest brother Teodósio, Prince of Brazil, Afonso became the heir-apparent to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd Prince of Brazil.He succeeded his father (João IV) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, (Luisa of Medina-Sidonia) was named regent in his father's will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his disinterest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662. Luisa oversaw military victories over the Spanish at Ameixial (June 8 1663) and Montes Claros (June 17 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of Portugal's independence on February 13 1668 in the Treaty of Lisbon. Colonial affairs saw the Dutch conquest of Jaffnapatam, Portugal's last colony in Sri Lanka (1658) and the cession of Bombay and Tangier to England (June 23, 1661) as dowry for Afonso's sister, Catherine of Braganza who had married King Charles II of England. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of Brazil in return for uncontested control of Sri Lanka.In 1662, the Count of Castelo Melhor saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.He was married to Marie Françoise of Nemours, the daughter of the Duke of Nemours, in 1666, but this marriage would not last long. Marie Françoise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filled for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso's brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, (future (Peter II)). That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent. Afonso was exiled to the island of Terceira in the Azores for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at Sintra in 1683.His trial is the base for José Mário Grilo's 1990 film, The King's Trial (O Processo do Rei).Ancestors+'Maria's ancestors in three generations'Afonso VI of PortugalFather:John IV of PortugalFather's father:Teodósio II, Duke of BraganzaFather's father's father:John II, Duke of BraganzaFather's father's mother:Infanta Catarina of Guimarães, Duchess of BraganzaFather's mother:Ana de Velasco y GirónFather's mother's father:Juan Fernández de Velasco, Duke of FriasFather's mother's mother:Ana Ángela de Aragón y GuzmánMother:Luisa of Medina-Sidonia (Luisa de Guzmán)Mother's father:Juan Manuel de Guzmán El Bueno, Duke of Medina-SidoniaMother's father's father:Alonso de Guzmán El Bueno, Duke of Medina-SidoniaMother's father's mother:Ana de Sylva y MendozaMother's mother:Juana Lourença Gómez de Sandoval y la CerdaMother's mother's father:Francisco Goméz de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of LermaMother's mother's mother:Catarina de LacerdaReferences       Category:Portuguese monarchs Category:Dukes of Braganza Category:Modern child rulers Category:1643 births Category:1683 deaths Category:Princes of Brazil Category:House of Braganzaar:ألفونسو السادس ملك البرتغال ca:Alfons VI de Portugal de:Alfons VI.
