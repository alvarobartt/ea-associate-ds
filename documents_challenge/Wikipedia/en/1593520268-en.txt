FC Köln.He is a versatile and skillful left wing-back.CareerOn October 8 2005, Wome missed a 95th minute penalty during Cameroon's final World Cup qualifier against Egypt that would have sent the Indomitable Lions to the 2006 FIFA World Cup; unfortunately for Wome he cannoned the shot off the outside of the post and the Ivory Coast qualified at their expense.During a press conference several days afterward, Wome said about the penalty: “No one wanted to take that penalty. No one. Neither Samuel Eto'o nor our captain Rigobert Song, because they knew what could have happened if they missed. I have always had the courage and I went to the spot.” He also claimed that some Cameroon fans wanted to kill him.On March 19 2007, Wome announced his retirement from international football.Wome is one of five players to have played in the top division in Italy, Spain, England and Germany (The others are Jon Dahl Tomasson, Abel Xavier, Gheorghe Popescu, and Florin Raducioiu).ReferencesExternal linksPierre Wome Autograph Career statistics at fussballdaten.de    Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:Vicenza Calcio players Category:A.S.
