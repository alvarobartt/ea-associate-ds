It is used as a symbol of the brewery]] Pilsner Urquell (international title in German, Plzeňský Prazdroj in Czech) is a bottom-fermenting beer produced since 1842 in Pilsen, Bohemia (Plzeň, Czech Republic). The beer is today a prominent brand of global brewing empire SABMiller, which has also started brewing Pilsner Urquell in Poland and Russia.Pilsner Urquell is somewhat heavier (with an almost ale-like fruitiness in the malt body) and more strongly hopped than most pilsener beers, which is considered by many to be its most distinguishing characteristic. . Saaz hops, a noble hop variety, are a key element in its flavour profile, as are the use of soft waterhttp://www.pilsner-urquell.com/html/en_gb/_2_1_3.html and fire-brewinghttp://www.pilsner-urquell.com/html/en_gb/_2_2_2.html. It is available in a 500ml (half litre) aluminium can in addition to the classic, stylish green bottle, pictured here on the right.HistoryAs its name claims ("original source" is the meaning of both "Urquell" in German; the official language of Bohemia when it was a part of the Austrian Empire in which the brewery was founded in 1839, and of "Prazdroj", in Czech); it is the world's original pilsener, or golden beer. Most popular lagers produced in the rest of the world are based upon this original beer. Jackson, Michael. Ultimate Beer, page 124, DK Publishing, Inc., 1998. ISBN 0-789-43527-6 Many beers that call themselves a pilsner, pilsener or pils is referring to being made in the style of this beer, first brewed by Josef Groll on 5 October 1842.

After local competition had been founded in 1869, in 1898 they also registered Original Pilsner Bier 1842 and Pilsner Urquell. Czech versions were Plzeňský pramen, Prapramen, Měšťanské Plzeňské, Plzeňský pravý zdroj were brand names that the Burgess' Brewery registered at the end of the nineteenth century; however, it was another name that persevered: Pilsner Urquell, and Plzeňský Prazdroj in Czech.
