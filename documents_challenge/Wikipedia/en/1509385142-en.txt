In 2003 it had an estimated population of some 467,900 people.Web&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The site has been inhabited continuously since pre-Islamic times as a center for agriculture and commerce. The name itself is thought to have come from the Assyrian language Baya 'quba, meaning "Yacoub's (Jacob) house." It served as a way station between Baghdad and Khorasan on the medieval Silk Road. It is now known as the center of Iraq's commercial orange groves.Half the residents of the city form the Al Jubour tribe.Recent historyDuring the course of the U.S-led occupation of Iraq, Baquba emerged as the scene of some of the heaviest guerrilla activity, along with the Sunni enclaves of Fallujah, Ramadi, and Samarra. It was the site of the heaviest fighting during the June 24, 2004 insurgent offensive. Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad, led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, took responsibility for the attacks.In a setback for insurgents, Iraqi and U.S. officials confirmed on June 8, 2006, that al-Zarqawi had been killed in an airstrike and subsequent raid 8 km (5 miles) north of Baquba.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5058304.stm During late 2006, however, Baqubah and much of Diyala province were reported to have come under Sunni insurgent control. http://onthescene.msnbc.com/baghdad/2006/12/reporting_under.html#posts On January 3, 2007 the previous Iraqi government in Baquba was reported to have fallen, leaving the city in the hands of insurgents fighting against the American led coalition in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The city at its peak had over 460,000 residents, but a February 2007 report labeled the city a "ghost town" as residents either fled criminal and sectarian violence or remained in hiding at home. http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/02/15/btsc.damon.baquba/index.htmlAttacks during Iraq warThe following is a list of deadly attacks in the city including the death of al-Zarqawi and after. http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070122/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_baqouba_glance&lt;/ref&gt;June 7, 2006: A U.S. airstrike kills Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, near Baqubah, northeast of Baghdad.June 26, 2006: At least 25 people are killed in a bicycle bombing in the city, according to police.Oct. 3, 2006: In a string of deadly attacks, gunmen open fire on a Shiite family fleeing the city, killing five of them.
