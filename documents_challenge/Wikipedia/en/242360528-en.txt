The team plays in Trud Stadium (Tomsk).The team was previously named "Burevestnik" (1957), "Tomich" (1958, 1961-1963), "Sibelektromotor" (1959-1960), "Torpedo" (1964-1967, 1974-1978), "Tomles" (1968-1973) and "Manometr" (1979-1987).In the 1990s the team acquired a number of players that would help them begin their ascent out of the Russian Second Division. Victor Sebelyev, Valery Konovalov and Ruslan Akhidzhak were key players of the early part of the decade with Sergei Ageev, Vyacheslav Vishnevskii and Dmitry Kudinov strengthening the team as they made a run on the division championship. In 1996, the team finished 2nd in the division, just falling short of promotion to the Russian First Division. In 1997, Tomsk finally achieved a significant goal when the advanced to the First Division with a strong season. However, the team had a long way to go before they would make another run on a division title.Following promotion, the team acquired a number of new players including Sergei Zhukov, Andrei Talalaev and Mikhail Murashov to help keep the team in the First Division. However, Tomsk suffered a blow when their newly privatised sponsor, Eastern Oil Company (VNK) pulled out and left the team with no sponsor. At this point, advancement was a pipe dream with survival in the tougher division becoming a priority. It was at this point that the team also had to upgrade their stadium to new standards of the league.The team played middling football for several years until the arrival of a new sponsor brought in needed funds and allowed the team to acquire new players and begin to compete. Third-place finishes in 2002 and 2003 left the team just short of promotion. However, the 2004 season brough new joy and Tomsk finished second in the division, earning promotion for the 2005 season. The 2005 season saw Tomsk survive their first year in top-flight football with a 10th place finish. In 2006, the team improved its position slightly with an 8th place finish but in 2007, the club slipped to an 11th place finish.The former jersey sponsor Tomskneft, a local subsidiary of Yukos, has recently been sold to new investors. Today, the team is sponsored by the regional authorities.League positionSeasonLeaguePositionGamesWonLostDrawnGoalsPointsResult1992League One East]]7301191029-2432&nbsp;1993League One East1230914741-4025Relegated to League Two1994League Two East]]222124647-1530&nbsp;1995League Two East8341511854-2553&nbsp;1996League Two East230195648-2463&nbsp;1997League Two East134263582-2083Promoted to League One1998First Division144215161154-4556&nbsp;1999First Division12421718748-5458&nbsp;2000First Division103814141036-2852&nbsp;2001First Division73412111131-2847&nbsp;2002First Division3341771051-2361&nbsp;2003First Division3422571055-2385&nbsp;2004First Division2422710570-3886Promoted to Russian Premier League2005Premier League]]10309111028-3337&nbsp;2006Premier League8301111835-3341&nbsp;2007Premier League11308111137-3535&nbsp;2008Premier League&nbsp;Club recordsLargest Margin of Victory - Dynamo Yakutsk - 9-1 (1995), FC Sakhalin Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk - 8-0 (1993), PFC Spartak Nalchik 8-0 (1998)Largest Margin of Defeat - FC Dynamo Barnaul 0-7 (1962)All time Leading Scorer - Viktor Sebelyev - 83 goals in 287 matches (1989-2004)Most goals in a season - Ruslan Akhidzhak - 18 goals in 21 matches (1994), Denis Kiselyov - 18 goals in 37 matches (2004)Current squadAs of August 31, 2008, according to the Official Russian Premier League website.
