It is in the département of Pas-de-Calais, of which it is a sous-préfecture. Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's préfecture (capital) resides in its third-largest city of Arras.The population of the city (commune) at the 1999 census was 77,333 inhabitants (74,800 as of February 2004 estimates). The population of the whole metropolitan area (aire urbaine) at the 1999 census was 125,584.Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only 34 km (21 miles) wide here, and is the closest French town to England, of which Calais was a territorial possession for several centuries. The white cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day.The old part of the town, Calais proper (or Calais-Nord), is situated on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and southeast.HistoryEconomyThe city's proximity to England has made it a major port for centuries. It is the principal ferry crossing point between England and France, with the vast majority of Channel crossings being made between Dover and Calais. The French end of the Channel Tunnel is also situated in the vicinity of Calais, in Coquelles some 4 miles (6 km) to the west of the town.The mainstay of the town's economy is, naturally, its port, but it also has a number of indigenous industries. The principal ones are lace making, chemicals, and paper manufacture. It possesses direct rail links to Paris (148 miles / 238 km to the south).As a result of the marked difference in taxation between Britain and France on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco, massive shopping complexes targeted at British day-trippers have sprung up on and around Calais to take advantage of the border trade. Such day trippers are colloquially known as "booze cruisers" and were the target of considerable attention from the UK Customs and Excise authorities. However, given that both the UK and France are members of the EU customs zone, there is no restriction on the movement of purchases between the two countries as long as the goods are for personal use.

SportCalais is represented in association football by the Calais RUFC, who will will compete in the Championnat National for the 2007-08 season having finished as Champions of the CFA Group A last season.Main sightsVirtually the entire town was destroyed by heavy bombardments during World War II, so there is little in Calais that pre-dates the war. For most visitors, the town is simply a place to pass through en route to other destinations.The town centre is dominated by its distinctive hotel de ville (town hall), built in the Flemish Renaissance style (and visible well out to sea). Directly in front of the town hall is a cast of the statue The Burghers of Calais (French Les Bourgeois de Calais), by Auguste Rodin.The German wartime military headquarters, situated near the train station in a small park, is today open to the public as a war museum.Immediately to the west is the Côte d'Opale, an extremely scenic cliff-lined section of coast that parallels the White Cliffs on the British coast and is part of the same geological formation.On clear days, the buildings of Calais can quite readily be seen with the naked eye from the British shore, 33 km (21 miles) away.ReferencesExternal linksOfficial Website (in French)Agglomération (in French)Info about the port and city (in French)Port of CalaisCalais fortificationsOld Postcard Views of CalaisPhotos of Calais in 3d (Anaglyphs).3D View of Castle of Calais from Henry VIII period Google Earth Category:Calais Category:Communes of Pas-de-Calais Category:Artificial islands Category:Port cities and towns in Franceals:Calais bs:Calais ca:Calais ceb:Calais cs:Calais cy:Calais da:Calais de:Calais el:Καλαί es:Calais eo:Calais eu:Calais fr:Calais gl:Calais hr:Calais io:Calais id:Calais it:Calais he:קאלה la:Calesium lb:Calais nl:Calais ja:カレー (フランス) no:Calais nn:Calais oc:Calais pl:Calais pt:Calais ro:Calais ru:Кале simple:Calais sk:Calais sl:Calais sr:Кале fi:Calais sv:Calais tr:Calais vi:Calais vo:Calais (Fransän) zh:加来
