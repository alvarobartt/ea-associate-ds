The Roan Antelope (Hippotragus equinus) is a savanna antelope found in West, Central, East Africa and Southern Africa.Roan Antelope stand about a metre and half at the shoulder and weigh around 250 kilograms. Named for the "roan' colour (a reddish brown), they have a lighter underbelly, white eyebrows and cheeks and a black face, lighter in females. There is a short erect mane, a very light beard and prominent red nostrils. The horns are ringed and can reach a metre long in males, slightly shorter in females. They arch backwards slightly.They are similar in appearance to Sable Antelope and can be confused where their ranges overlap. Sable Antelope males are darker, being black rather than dark brown.Roan Antelope are found in woodland and grassland savanna mainly in the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome, which range in tree density from forest with a grassy understorey (such as Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands) to grasslands dotted with few trees, where they eat mid-length grass. They form harem groups of five to fifteen animals with a dominant male. Roan Antelope commonly fight among themselves for dominance of their herd, brandishing their horns while both animals are on their knees.ReferencesCategory:Grazing antelopes Category:Mammals of Africa Category:Fauna of South Africa Category:Fauna of Namibia Category:Fauna of West Africa Category:Fauna of East Africa Category:Mammals of Kenya Category:Fauna of Tanzania Category:Fauna of the Sahara Category:Fauna of Sudan Category:Fauna of Ethiopia Category:Fauna of Angola Category:Fauna of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Fauna of the Republic of the Congo Category:Fauna of Zambia Category:Megafauna of Africaaf:Bastergemsbok cs:Antilopa koňská de:Pferdeantilope es:Hippotragus equinus fr:Hippotragus equinus lt:Arklinė antilopė hu:Fakó lóantilop nl:Roanantilope pl:Antylopa końska pt:Palanca-vermelha fi:Isohevosantilooppi uk:Чала антилопа zh:马羚
