It also has destinations on lines that make it more closely resemble commuter train lines in being scheduled and not grade-separated. A tramway system north of the Túria riverbed park is considered Line 4 of the MetroValencia.This network consists of more than  of track, of which around  is below ground.Although Spanish is the main language spoken in Valencia, the system authority Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana uses bilingual signage in Valencian (a subform of Catalan) and Spanish.LinesLineTerminalsLengthNumber ofstationsPassengers in 2005kmmi1Llíria/Bétera – Torrent Av. - Villanueva. de Castellón95.259.55819,277,1232Sant Miquel dels Reis - Natzaretunder construction, completion expected 20103Rafelbunyol - Aeroport19.812.42125,450,0004Mas del Rosari/Fira de Valencia – Dr. Lluch9.86.1325,088,0925Neptú ~ Marítim-Serreria - Aeroport/Torrent Avinguda.17.7111811,700,0006Tossal del Rei - Marítim Serrería9.25.7222Technical dataGauge width: 1000&amp;nbsp;mmCurrent system: 750 V DC / 1500 V DC, overhead wireHistory[[Image:Torrent avinguda station valencia.jpg|right|thumb|Lines 1 and 5 at Torrent Avinguda Station. Differences between the old line (1) and the new line (5) can be noticed on this picture]] .]] .]]First four linesOn 8 October 1988 the tunnel through which line 1 crosses Valencia was opened between Sant Isidre and Ademuz (now Empalme), which connected the line with southbound trains from València-Jesús to Castelló de la Ribera (now Villanueva de Castellón) at Sant Isidre. Line 2 went from València-Sud to Llíria, with some trains terminating in Paterna.In May 1994 the ''tranvia'' line 4 opened. Valencia was the first city in Spain to use this mode of transport. Originally line 4 was  long and had 21 stations. The line connected the suburban lines with high demand zones such as the Polytechnic University, the new university campus and the Malvarosa beach, which the former line Empalme - Pont de Fusta - El Grau had connected before. One year later, in May 1995, line 3 was extended from El Palmaret in Alboraria to Alameda. The extension reused the older railway line Pont de Fusta-Rafelbunyol, of which part was scrapped (between Pont de Fusta - Sant Llorenç - El Palmaret), and the rest was switched from 750&nbsp;V to 1500&nbsp;V.Further alterations followed five years later. On 16 September 1998, line 2 was merged with line 1, and Line 3 was extended from Alameda to Avinguda del Cid in the west and Torrent in the south with some trains only going as far as Jesús. Half a year later, on 20 May 1999, line 3 was extended from Avinguda del Cid to Mislata-AlmassilLines 5 and 6, and more extensionsIn April 2003, the new line 5 was opened. This line took over the the previous line 3 connection from Alameda to Torrent, together with a newly constructed branch from Alameda to Ayora . (Although some very early morning trains still travel from Machado to Torrent, this is not represented on maps.) One year later, the new line 5 was extended, together with line 1, from Torrent to Torrent Avinguda, a distance of 2.3 kilometres. On October 3rd 2005, Bailén station was opened on line 5. This station is between Colón and Jesús, and has connections with València-Nord, the main railway station of València. Furthermore, Bailen is close to the Plaça d'Espanya station on line 1. In October 2005, line 4 was extended to Mas del Rosari, and on 20th December 2005 to Lloma Llarga-Terramelar.2nd April 2007 - Line 5 was extended to the East to a new station Marítim-Serrería (originally planned as Jerónimo Monsoriu).18th April 2007 - Line 5 extended to the Airport (Aeroport Station) in the east and to the Port (Neptú Station) in the west, this last section from Marítim-Serreria to Neptú is a tram section; the trains go from Aeroport to Marítim-Serrreria and then a tram operates between Marítim-Serreria and Neptú. Line 3 was extended to the Airport as well to cover the schedule limitations of line 5 to Aeroport station.22nd September 2007 - Line 6 was opened, linking the neighbourhoods of Orriols and Torrefiel to the metro system for the first time. Additionally a new station "Torre del Virrei" was added to Line 1. It is situated between the stations of "L'Eliana" and "La Pobla de Vallbona"AccidentsOn 9th September 2005, two trains crashed into each other on Line 1. Nobody was killed, but according to early reports 35 people were injured, 4 of whom were taken to hospital, their condition described as serious. The first train had been stationary waiting for a red signal. The second used its emergency brakes to avoid a collision, but was hit by a third train. The force of the impact severely damaged the drivers' cabs at the front of the last train and at the rear of the second train. The crash occurred between Paiporta and Picanya about 5 km south-east of the city centre. The 3729 and 3730 EMUs are now a single EMU with 3729A and the 3730A cars, the 'B' cars were severely damaged and are currently at València-Sud workshop, waiting to be scrapped.3 July 2006 was a black day for the Valencia metro. In a severe accident, a two-car EMU derailed between Jesús and Plaça d'Espanya stations. At least 43 people were killed and 52 injured. It was the worst metro accident in Spanish history.External linksInformation, images and mapshttp://www.metrovalencia.com/metroval/htmleng/conoce/parque.htmSee alsoList of Valencia, Spain metro stationsBarcelona MetroBilbao MetroMadrid MetroList of metro systemsCategory:Valencia Category:Transport in the Valencian community Category:Rail transport in Spain Category:Underground rapid transit systems Category:Rapid transit in Spainca:MetroValencia de:Metro Valencia es:MetroValencia fr:Métro de Valence nl:Metro van Valencia ja:バレンシアメトロ no:Valencias bybane pl:Metro w Walencji ru:Метрополитен Валенсии (Испания) fi:Valencian metro sv:Metrovalencia
