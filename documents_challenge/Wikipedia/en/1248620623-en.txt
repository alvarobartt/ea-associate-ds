Both Waterford and League winners Cork United finished on equal points but Cork were awarded the title as Waterford were unable to compete in the play-off due to a dispute regarding payment to players. Waterford won the Shield again in the 1952-1953 season and were again runners-up in the League this time to St. Patricks Athletic in the 1954-1955 season and again in the 1962-1963 season.The club eventually won the league title for the first time in the 1965-1966 season and this was the beginning of a hugely successful spell for the club domestically.

The following season Waterford won the FAI League Cup, however failed to regain the league title. They won the FAI Cup in 1980 beating St. Patricks Athletic and this was the clubs final honour as Waterford F.C.Waterford's success in the league brought European football playing against famous clubs such as Manchester United and Celtic.Waterford United 1982-PresentIn 1982 due to financial problems, the Club changed its name to Waterford United and Alfie Hale was appointed manager. In 1985 the league's membership rose to 22 clubs with the election of six new clubs in 1985. This resulted in the introduction of the present two Division (Premier and First) structure in 1985/86 of which Waterford was a member of the Premier Division. Waterford has had twenty four different managers since 1985, suffering relegation and promotion between both divisions Waterford were relegated to the First Division in the 1988-1989 season. Their stay there was short, gaining promotion and winning the First Division title the following season 1989-1990. They were unable to retain their Premier Division status the following season finishing in eleventh.The club was promoted to the top flight in the 1991-1992 season finishing as runners up to Limerick F.C.. But again the club were unable to remain in the Premier Division for more than a single season suffering relegation on goal difference to Drogheda United.Waterford United were promoted to the Premier Division, finishing top of the First Division in the 1997-1998 season and remained there until the 1999-2000 season suffering relegation by one point to Galway United. They were promoted to the Premier division again in the 2002-2003 season and have since remained there.In 2006 Waterford United were relegated to the First Division. The F.A.I took over the running of the Eircom League at the end of the 2006 season. Part of this takeover involved the assessment of all Eircom League sides and the manner in which they were being run including finances, infrastructure, future plans, marketability and previous finishing positions since the 2002 season, ( this was due to Kildare County only joining the Eircom League in 2002). Despite finishing in 11th and last place ( Dublin City F.C. being the 12th team in the league and subsequently folding during the season) the club were forced to play a relegation/promotion playoff against Dundalk F.C.. Despite being defeated Waterford United still stood a chance of remaining a Premier Division side due to the FAI assessment. However on the 8th December 2006 the FAI decided to relegate Waterford to the 1st Division with Shamrock Rovers and Galway United replacing them and now defunct Dublin City. Dundalk, despite beating Waterford in a playoff were controversially overlooked and remain in the 1st Division. However on the 20th February it was announced that Waterford United had been invited to participate in the Premier Division for the forthcoming season. Club secretary Larry Gough stated "The club considered the proposal carefully and decided to accept the invitation in the best interests of football in Waterford and the eircom league". Reinstatement to Premier DivisionDespite the FAI's original decision to relegate Waterford United, the club was reinstated to the new FAI run Premier Division following the relegation of Shelbourne F.C. to the FAI First Division on 20 February 2007.PersonnelBoard MembersDirectors: Chris Everett and Michael DrohanHonorary President: Bertie RogersManagement Committee: Tony Burke, John Douglas, Michael Drohan, Chris Everett, Greg Pheasey, Larry Gough, John O'Driscoll, John O'Sullivan, Ray Scott, Sam White.-StaffClub Administrator: Michael DrohanClub Promotions Officer (CPO): Liam FraiserFinance Officer: Ger McGinnMedia Officer: Ray ScottProgramme Editor: Sam WhiteClub Chaplain: Fr.
