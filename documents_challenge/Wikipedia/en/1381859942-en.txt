 Tritium (, symbol  or , also known as Hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains no neutrons and one proton.DecayWhile Tritium has several different experimentally-determined values of its half-life, the NIST recommends 4500±8 days (approximately 12.32 years)Comprehensive Review and Critical Evaluation of the Half-Life of Tritium, National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The electron has an average kinetic energy of 5.7&nbsp;keV, while the remaining energy is carried off by the nearly undetectable electron antineutrino. The low-energy beta radiation from tritium cannot penetrate human skin, so tritium is only dangerous if inhaled or ingested. Its low energy also creates difficulty detecting tritium labelled compounds except by using liquid scintillation counting.ProductionTritium occurs naturally due to cosmic rays interacting with atmospheric gases.

This is possible with neutrons of any energy, and is an exothermic reaction yielding 4.8 MeV, which is more than one-quarter of the energy that fusion of the produced triton with a deuteron can later produce.

H + T:&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;|| |Tritium is occasionally a direct product of nuclear fission, with a yield of about 0.01% (one per 10000 fissions).Tritium (Hydrogen-3), Human Health Fact Sheet, Argonne National Laboratory, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This means that tritium release or recovery needs to be considered in nuclear reprocessing even in ordinary spent nuclear fuel where tritium production was not a goal.Tritium is also produced in heavy water-moderated reactors when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a very small cross section (which is why heavy water is such a good neutron moderator) and relatively little tritium is produced; nevertheless, cleaning tritium from the moderator may be desirable after several years to reduce the risk of escape to the environment. Ontario Power Generation's Tritium Removal Facility can process up to 2.5 thousand tonnes (2,500 Mg) of heavy water a year, producing about 2.5 kg of tritium. The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;According to IEER's 1996 report about the United States Department of Energy, only 225 kg of tritium has been produced in the US since 1955. Since it is continuously decaying into helium-3, the stockpile was approximately 75 kg at the time of the report.Tritium: The environmental, health, budgetary, and strategic effects of the Department of Energy's decision to produce tritium, Hisham Zerriffi January, 1996Tritium for American nuclear weapons was produced in special heavy water reactors at the Savannah River Site until their shutdown in 1988; with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty after the end of the Cold War, existing supplies were sufficient for the new, smaller number of nuclear weapons for some time. Production was resumed with irradiation of lithium-containing rods (replacing the usual boron-containing control rods) at the commercial Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station in 2003-2005 followed by extraction of tritium from the rods at the new Tritium Extraction Facility at SRS starting in November 2006.http://www.srs.gov/general/news/factsheets/tef.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;PropertiesTritium has an atomic mass of 3.0160492. It is a gas (2 or 2) at standard temperature and pressure. It combines with oxygen to form a liquid called tritiated water, &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or partially tritiated water, .Tritium figures prominently in studies of nuclear fusion because of its favorable reaction cross section and the large amount of energy (17.6 MeV) produced through its reaction with deuterium: He + n:&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;|| |All atomic nuclei, being composed of protons and neutrons, repel one another because of their positive charge. However, if the atoms have a high enough temperature and pressure (for example, in the core of the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such electrical repulsion (called the Coulomb force), and they can come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.The tritium nucleus, containing one proton and two neutrons, has the same charge as the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, and it experiences the same electrostatic repulsive force when brought close to another atomic nucleus. However, the neutrons in the tritium nucleus increase the attractive strong nuclear force when brought close enough to another atomic nucleus. As a result, tritium can more easily fuse with other light atoms, compared with the ability of ordinary hydrogen to do so.The same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, of deuterium. This is why brown dwarfs (so-called failed stars) cannot burn hydrogen, but they do indeed burn deuterium.1.2 Curie 4" x .2" Tritium vials are simply tritium gas-filled glass vials, the inner surfaces of which are coated with a phosphor. The "gaseous tritium light source" vial shown here is 1.5 years old.]]Like hydrogen, tritium is difficult to confine. Rubber, plastic, and some kinds of steel are all somewhat permeable. This has raised concerns that if tritium is used in quantity, in particular for fusion reactors, it may contribute to radioactive contamination, although its short half-life should prevent significant long-term accumulation in the atmosphere.Atmospheric nuclear testing (prior to the Partial Test Ban Treaty) proved unexpectedly useful to oceanographers, as the sharp spike in surface tritium levels could be used over the years to measure the rate of mixing of the lower and upper ocean levels.Health risksTritium is relatively similar to hydrogen, which makes that it binds to OH as Tritiated water (HTO), and that it can make organic bonds (OBT) easily. The HTO and the OBT are easily ingested by drinking, through organic or water-containg foodstuffs. As tritium is a strong beta emitter, it is not dangerous externally, but it is a radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested via food, water, or absorbed through the skin.

Some figures are given below.Canada: 7,000 Becquerel per liter (Bq/L).United States: 740 Bq/L or 20,000 picoCurie per liter (pCi/L) ''(Safe Drinking Water Act)World Health Organization: 10,000 Bq/L.European Union: 'investigative' limit of 100* Bq/L.The U.S. limit is calculated to yield a dose of 4 mrem (or 40 microsieverts in SI units) per year.UsageSelf-powered lightingThe emitted electrons from small amounts of tritium cause phosphors to glow so as to make self-powered lighting devices called betalights, which are now used in watches and exit signs. It is also used in certain countries to make glowing keychains, and compasses. This takes the place of radium, which can cause bone cancer and has been banned in most countries for decades.The aforementioned IEER report claims that the commercial demand for tritium is 400 grams per year.Nuclear weaponsTritium is widely used in nuclear weapons for boosting a fission bomb or the fission primary of a thermonuclear weapon. Before detonation, a few grams of tritium-deuterium gas are injected into the hollow "pit" of fissile plutonium or uranium. The early stages of the fission chain reaction supply enough heat and compression to start DT fusion, then both fission and fusion proceed in parallel, the fission assisting the fusion by continuing heating and compression, and the fusion assisting the fission with highly energetic (14.1 MeV) neutrons. As the fission fuel depletes and also explodes outward, it falls below the density needed to stay critical by itself, but the fusion neutrons make the fission process progress faster and continue longer than it would without boosting. Increased yield comes overwhelmingly from the increase in fission; the energy released by the fusion itself is much smaller because the amount of fusion fuel is much smaller.Besides increased yield (for the same amount of fission fuel with vs. without boosting) and the possibility of variable yield (by varying the amount of fusion fuel), possibly even more important advantages are allowing the weapon (or primary of a weapon) to have a smaller amount of fissile material (eliminating the risk of predetonation by nearby nuclear explosions) and more relaxed requirements for implosion, allowing a smaller implosion system.Because the tritium in the warhead is continuously decaying, it is necessary to replenish it periodically. The estimated quantity needed is 4 grams per warhead.IEER Tritium Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; To maintain constant inventory, 0.22 grams per warhead per year must be produced.As tritium quickly decays and is difficult to contain, the much larger secondary charge of a thermonuclear weapon instead uses lithium deuteride as its fusion fuel; during detonation, neutrons split lithium-6 into helium-4 and tritium; the tritium then fuses with deuterium, producing more neutrons. As this process requires a higher temperature for ignition, and produces fewer and less energetic neutrons (only - fusion and  splitting are net neutron producers),  is not used for boosting, only for secondaries. Controlled nuclear fusionTritium is an important fuel for controlled nuclear fusion in both magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion reactor designs. The experimental fusion reactor ITER and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) will use Deuterium-Tritium (-) fuel. The [[Fusion power#D-T fuel cycle|'-' reaction]] is favored since it has the largest fusion cross-section (~ 5 barns peak) and reaches this maximum cross-section at the lowest energy (~65 keV center-of-mass) of any potential fusion fuel.The Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) was a facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory dedicated to the development and demonstration of technologies required for fusion-relevant Deuterium-Tritium processing.Small arms sightsTritium is used to make the sights of some small arms illuminate at night. Most night sights are used on semi-automatic handguns. The reticule on the SA80's optical SUSAT sight ('S'ight 'U'nit 'S'mall 'A'rms 'T'rilux) contains a small amount of tritium for the same effect as an example of tritium use on a rifle sight.Analytical chemistryTritium is sometimes used as a radiolabel. It has the advantage that hydrogen appears in almost all organic chemicals making it easy to find a place to put tritium on the molecule under investigation. It has the disadvantage of producing a comparatively weak signal.History Tritium was first predicted in the late 1920s by Walter Russell, using his "spiral" periodic table, then produced in 1934 from deuterium, another isotope of hydrogen, by Ernest Rutherford, working with Mark Oliphant and Paul Harteck. Rutherford was unable to isolate the tritium, a job that was left to Luis Alvarez and Robert Cornog, who correctly deduced that the substance was radioactive. Willard F. Libby discovered that tritium could be used for dating water, and therefore wine.ReferencesExternal linksNuclear Data Evaluation LabAnnotated bibliography for tritium from the Alsos Digital LibraryNLM Hazardous Substances Databank &amp;ndash; Tritium, RadioactiveTritium on Ice: The Dangerous New Alliance of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Power by Kenneth D.
