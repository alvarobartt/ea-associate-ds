Region Hovedstaden (Capital Region of Denmark, official translation) is an administrative region of Denmark established on January 1, 2007 as part of the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which replaced the traditional counties ("amter") with five larger regions. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 271 to 98. The reform was implemented in Denmark on January 1, 2007.The new Region Hovedstaden consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, the former counties of Copenhagen and Frederiksborg, and the regional municipality of Bornholm.Without the remote island municipality Bornholm, located 140 km (80 miles) southeast of Copenhagen, the population is 1,603,008 on an area of 1,973 km² (762 sq. m.) with a density of 812.47 per km² (2,103 per sq m), as opposed to 642.64 (1,665) with all 29 municipalities included.Before 2007, a Danish Capital Region, Hovedstadsregionen did exist, but it did not cover exactly the same area.The State Administration for Greater Copenhagen (Statsforvaltningen Hovedstaden) represents the central Government in Region Hovedstaden and supervises the Region and municipalities.
