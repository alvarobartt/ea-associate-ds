Yamaoka attended Tokyo Art College , where he studied product design and interior design. He joined Konami on September 21, 1993, after previously being a freelance music composer.BiographyHe is most well known for his work for the Silent Hill series of video games, for which he composed all the music and sound effects in the whole series (excluding Silent Hill: Play Novel for the Game Boy Advance and "Esperandote" in Silent Hill, composed by Rika Muranaka). Since Silent Hill 3, he is playing a more important role as the series' producer, also continuing with his music composition working.Yamaoka's sound commonly contains strong melancholy undertones and generally identifies with the dark ambient, industrial, trip-hop and rock genres. Since Silent Hill 3, he also started working in collaboration with Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Joe Romersa for vocal compositions.Much of his work from previous titles has been compiled for the 2006 Silent Hill movie adaptation, directed by Christophe Gans.His music from Silent Hill 2 was performed live in 2005 at the third Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany. Yamaoka also performed music from Silent Hill at the world-premiere of PLAY! A Video Game Symphony on May 27, 2006 in Chicago, Illinois, and accompanied the orchestra with an electric seven-string guitar. He also composed songs for KONAMI's Bemani series, which has also featured tracks from Silent Hill.His first original album, iFUTURELIST, was released in January 2006.Personal lifeBefore working as a video game composer, Yamaoka initially sought a career as a designer, but instead became a musician after studying product design at Tokyo Art College .In 1993 he joined Konami to work on the game Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2 . When Konami began searching for a musician to compose Silent Hill's score, Yamaoka volunteered because he thought he was the only one capable of making the soundtrack.  InfluencesYamaoka cites among his influences Angelo Badalamenti (best known known for his soundtrack work with David Lynch), Metallica, and Depeche Mode. When asked if his studies at Tokyo Art College had helped him in his musical career, he replied :"At that time, Mick Karn of Japan, Steve Strange of Visage, and a lot of other musicians combined the notions of Art and Music with their own new style. I got really influenced by that. Therefore, every time I write songs, I try to combine Art and Music."CreditsGame TitleYearConsoleRoleCommentsSmartBallalso known as Jerry Boy1991Super FamicomAssistant ComposersUnsure of this credit.With Hirohiko Fukuda and Manabu Saito. --Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 21994Sega Mega DriveComposerAkira Yamaoka's first project at Konami.With Kazuhiko Uehara, Masahiro Ikariko, M.
