Black typically begins a skit in which he presents an earnest introduction to a premise or subject that quickly reveals itself to be flawed or fundamentally ludicrous. Black then switches completely to a far-extreme caricature of human emotion.His would-be straight-man Gass often functions to trigger these outbursts. Tenacious D’s subject matter illustrates this technique. In "Tribute", Tenacious D tells a story in which they claim to have performed, "The Greatest Song in the World," for a, "Shiny Demon," who would otherwise "EAT THEIR SOULS". In "Inward Singing", Black doesn’t merely discover a new vocal technique, he discovers what he refers to as "the most powerful tool in singing technology since yodeling". Black's skits also use the catchphrase 'more cushion for the pushin', a self-deprecating reference to his abdominal body fat.FilmographyYearTitleRoleOther notes1991]]Our Shining MomentsTeenage Boy1992]]''Bob RobertsRoger Davis1993Demolition Man]]''Wasteland ScrapAirborne]]''Augie1994The NeverEnding Story IIISlipBlind Justice]]''Private1995WaterworldFloatplane PilotThe X-FilesBart "Zero" LiquoriDead Man Walking]]''Craig Poncelet1996Mars Attacks!Billy Glenn NorrisThe Fan]]''TechnicianThe Cable GuyRickCrossworldsSteve1997The Jackal]]''Ian LamontBongwater]]''Devlin1998I Still Know What You Did Last SummerTitus TelescoEnemy of the State]]''Fiedler1999Jesus' SonGeorgieCradle Will RockSid2000]]High Fidelity]]''Barry2001Shallow HalHal LarsonSaving SilvermanJ.D.
