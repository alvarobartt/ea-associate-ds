Sir Arnold Edward Trevor Bax, KCVO (8 November 1883&ndash;3 October 1953), was an English composer and poet. His musical style blended elements of Romanticism and Impressionism, always with a strong Celtic influence. His orchestral scores are noted for their complexity and colourful instrumentation. Bax’s poetry and stories, which he wrote under the pseudonym of Dermot O’Byrne, reflect his profound affinity with Irish poet William Butler Yeats and are largely written in the tradition of the Irish Literary Revival.LifeEarly yearsBax was born in Pendennis Road, Streatham, London, into a Victorian upper-middle-class family of Dutch descent. He grew up in Ivy Bank, a mansion on top of Haverstock Hill, Hampstead where he attended Heath Mount School.http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/composer/composer_main.asp?composerid=18539&amp;ttype=Biography&amp;ttitle=Biography&amp;langid=1. In Bax, A Composer and His Times (2007) Lewis Foreman suggests that, because of the family affluence, Bax never had to take a paid position and was free to pursue most of his interests. From an early age, Bax showed that he had a powerful intellect and great musical talent, especially at the keyboard. He often enjoyed playing the Wagner operas on piano. One of his first intimate meetings with art music was through Tristan und Isolde and its influence is seen in many of his later works, Tintagel for example. Bax was taught at home, but received his first formal musical education at age 16 from Cecil Sharp and others at the Hampstead Conservatory. He was accepted to the Royal Academy of Music in 1900 where he remained until 1905. At the Academy, he was taught composition by Frederick Corder, the Piano by Tobias Matthay and the Clarinet by Egerton. In his composition classes, Corder emphasized the examples of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner and pointed to their liberal approach to classical form, which led Bax to develop a similar attitude. He had an exceptional ability to sight-read and play complex orchestral scores at the piano, which won him several medals at the Academy and he also won prizes for best musical composition, including the Battison-Haynes prize and the competitive Charles Lucas medal.Bax discovers IrelandBax had a sensitive and searching soul and drew inspiration from a wide range of sources. He was a voracious reader of literature and in this way he happened upon William Butler Yeats's The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems in 1902. He proved highly receptive to the soft, melancholy moods of the Irish Literary Revival and found in Yeats a powerful muse, from which he derived a life-time of inspiration. He developed an infatuation with Ireland and began travelling extensively there. He visited the most isolated and secluded places, eventually discovering the little Donegal village Glencolumbkille, to which he returned annually for almost 30 years. Here, he drew inspiration from the landscape and the sea, and from the culture and life of the local Irish peasants – many of whom he regarded as close friends. His encounter with the poetry of Yeats and the landscapes of Ireland resulted in many new works, both musical and literary. The String Quartet in E (1903), which later was worked into the orchestral tone-poem Cathaleen-Ni-Houlihan (1905), are fine examples of how he began to reflect Ireland in his music. Not only did he emerge as a surprisingly mature composer with these works, he also developed in them floating and undulating 'impressionistic' musical textures using orchestral techniques not yet heard – not even from Claude Debussy. Many of the works he wrote in the period from 1903 to 1916 can be seen as musical counterparts to the Irish Literary Revival. The tone-poems Into The Twilight (1908), In The Faery Hills (1909) and Rosc-catha hymn (1910) echo the themes of the Revival and especially the soft, dreamy mood of many poems and stories.Conglomerate of influencesThe Irish influence is only one of many found in Bax's music. An early affinity with Norway and the literature of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson brought themes and moods from the Nordic countries into his music. From 1905 to 1911, Bax constantly alternated between using Nordic and Celtic themes in his compositions. He even attempted to teach himself some Norwegian and, in the song The Flute (1907) for voice and piano, he successfully set an original poem by Bjørnson to music. Later examples of Bax’s Nordic affinity include Hardanger for two pianos (1927) and the orchestral tone-poem The Tale the Pine-Trees Knew (1931).In 1910, a youthful fling with a Ukrainian girl, Natalia Skarginska, brought Bax to St Petersburg, Moscow and Lubny, near Kiev, which led to a fascination for Russian and Slavonic themes. The relationship with Skarginska resulted in an emotional agony from which he never completely recovered. His conflicting feelings are perhaps reflected in the First Piano Sonata in F sharp (1910, revised 1917-20). The Russian and Ukrainian influence can also be heard in two works for solo piano from 1912, Nocturne–May Night in the Ukraine and Gopak (Russian dance).In 1915 appeared In a Vodka Shop also for solo piano. In 1919, Bax was one of four British composers to be commissioned to write orchestral music to serve as interludes at Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in London. For the commission, he incorporated the three above-mentioned piano works of Russian themes into Russian Suite for orchestra. In 1920, he wrote incidental music to J. M. Barrie’s whimsical play The Truth About the Russian Dancers, his last work based on a clearly Russian theme. The Russian influence may be found in many of Bax's other scores and is especially predominant in his first three symphonies.Rathgar circleIn January 1911, not long after he returned to Britain, Bax married Elsita Sobrino, a childhood friend. They settled in Bushy Park Road, Rathgar, Dublin. Here Bax’s brother Clifford introduced them to the intellectual circle which met at the house of the poet, painter and mystic George William Russell. Bax had already had some of his poems and short stories published in Dublin and to the circle he was simply known by the pseudonym, Dermot O’Byrne (the name was possibly inspired by a renowned family of traditional musicians in Donegal).As Dermot O’Byrne, he was specifically noted for Seafoam and Firelight, published in London by the Orpheus Press in 1909 and numerous short stories and poems published in different media in Dublin. It was at Russell’s house where Bax one night met Irish Republican Patrick Pearse. According to Bax, they got on very well and, although they met only once, the execution of Pearse following the Easter Rebellion in 1916 prompted him to compose several laments, the most noted being In Memoriam Patric Pearse (1916), which contains the dedication ‘I gCuimhne ar Phádraig Mac Piarais’.Alienation, conflict and successThe threat of war led to the dissolution of the Rathgar Circle as many members fled Ireland and Europe. Bax and his family returned to London; it was the loss of a blissful life. Bax avoided conscription because of a heart condition and spent the war years composing profusely. Although World War I unleashed previously unimagined horrors upon the world, it was the Easter Rebellion and the destruction of Dublin that greatly disturbed Bax.As his Ireland&mdash;a haven and a retreat&mdash;was lost to bitter conflict and war, he sought refuge in a liaison with the younger pianist Harriet Cohen. What had started out as a purely professional alliance&mdash;Cohen playing and championing Bax's piano music&mdash;developed into a passionate relationship. Yet, their love could not be sanctioned by the contemporary social code, which brought them considerable emotional suffering.This difficult period in Bax’s life led to the composition of several attractive tone-poems, including Summer Music (1916), Tintagel (1917) and November Woods (1914-1917). In Tintagel, Bax reached back to legends and dreams&mdash;specifically that of the doomed lovers Tristan and Isolde. Tintagel is undoubtedly the best known of Bax’s tone-poems and includes a colourful evocation of the sea. Bax's relationship with Cohen led some commentators to assume a Freudian link between Bax’s alleged sexual passion and the sea-theme in Tintagel.However, the opening of Harriet Cohen's private papers and the research into them by scholars, such as the Norwegian musicologist Thomas Elnaes, indicates that such a link is at best speculative. Bax's works from this time reflect deep psychological conflicts that point forward to the passionate yet deeply troubled First Symphony in E flat, completed in 1922. After the war, British music was in demand as never before in England and Bax won considerable fame with his works, which were widely performed.Morar periodFrom 1928 onwards, Bax ceased to travel to Glencolumbkille and instead began his annual migration to Morar, west Scottish Highlands, to work. He would sketch his compositions in London and take them to the Station Hotel at Morar for the winter to orchestrate them. At this time, he found a new love in Mary Gleaves and she accompanied him to Scotland. In the Morar period, which lasted until the outbreak of World War II, Bax rediscovered his interest in Norway and the Nordic countries, and found a new muse in Sibelius. At Morar, he orchestrated Symphonies Nos. 3 to 7 and several of his finest orchestral works, including the three Northern Ballads.All seven of Bax's symphonies were composed within a relatively short span of time and are perhaps the most coherent cycle of symphonies by any composer. They reflect his many influences and are profound works of art with a deep psychological dimension tied to evocations of scenery. The symphonies earned Bax a reputation as the successor to Elgar, as Vaughan Williams, for instance, had only completed four symphonies by the time Bax had completed his seventh.Peter Pan of composersBax received a knighthood in 1937 (Knight Bachelor), but he was not entirely prepared to enjoy this honour. He contended that there was a conflict between the knighthood and his profound affinity with Ireland, but accepted nonetheless. A feeling that his creative energies were drained started to manifest. Bax explained to his friends that he felt tired, restless and lonely. He contended that he had a hard time ‘growing up’. His increasing age depressed him and he gradually succumbed to alcoholism. He also felt alienated by the new developments in Modernistic composition and realised, to his sorrow, that his style was falling out of fashion.In 1942, Bax was appointed Master of the King's Musick&lt;!-- Note &quot;Musick&quot; is not a typo. Correct spelling of the title until change to &quot;Music&quot; in 1975.--&gt;, a decision the British musical establishment was not altogether happy with. To many, Bax was an atypical English composer, some especially pointing to the 'Irishness' of his music.Of his later works, only the film scores for Malta G.C. and Oliver Twist were really successful. They earned Bax a renewed public acclaim, but could not compensate for his being regarded as somewhat of a musical fossil by many contemporary composers and critics. He retreated from the public scene and lived quietly at The White Horse Hotel in Storrington, Sussex.Ireland reaches outIn 1929, the Father Mathew Feis, a competitive music festival organized by the Capuchin Fathers, invited Bax to become adjudicator. It was Irish pianist Tilly Fleischmann who suggested him, knowing that he was familiar with Ireland and Irish conditions. This was also the first time Bax met Irish musicians in Ireland, other than folk musicians. In Cork, he was introduced to such outstanding musicians as the pianist Charles Lynch and singer Maura O'Connor, both of whom went on to give many performances of Bax’s music.Bax’s first visit to Cork marked the beginning of a 24 year friendship with the Fleischmann family. As performances of Bax’s music grew increasingly rare in Britain, Tilly Fleischmann demonstrated to Bax that his music had wide appeal in Ireland. Bax, however, did little to act on this and to support further efforts and his music was not heard nationwide in Ireland until Aloys Fleischmann began conducting his orchestral works with the Irish Radio Orchestra in Dublin just after the end of the war. In 1946, Bax became external examiner with both University College Cork and University College Dublin and he also gave individual tuition to aspiring young Irish composers. He received an honorary doctorate degree from the National University of Ireland in 1947.In 1953, Bax was further honoured by appointment as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO), an honour within the Queen's personal gift. He passed away during a visit to the Fleischmanns later that year, possibly from a complication of his heart condition. One of his last compositions was Coronation March for Queen Elizabeth II.Not long before he died, Bax was asked by the editor of the The World of Music which were his own preferred works. He provided the following selection:The Garden of Fand (1916)Symphony No. 3 (1929)Winter Legends (1930)The Tale the Pine Trees Knew (1931)Symphony No. 6 (1935)He died at age 69 and was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.Research and ScholarshipThe first biography of Bax was Colin Scott-Sutherland’s Arnold Bax published in 1973. It offers a description of Bax's life and some insightful analysis of his music, especially the large-scale works. Scott-Sutherland also published the works of Dermot O'Byrne (Bax's literary pseudonym): Ideala: Poems and Some Early Love Letters of Arnold Bax including the Collected Poems of Dermot O'Byrne (2001). Bax’s principal biographer, however, is the English writer Lewis Foreman. Foreman's first major contribution to Bax scholarship was a 1983 biography entitled Bax, A Composer and His Times. A second edition appeared in 1988 and a third edition in February 2007.The principal primary source for information regarding Bax’s life and philosophy is his anecdotal autobiography Farewell My Youth (1943), which, for personal reasons, ends at the year 1914. In it Bax attempted to create several myths about himself, but contradicted many of his own statements. Lewis Foreman's 1992 edition of Bax's autobiography is the most recent currently available. Entitled Farewell My Youth, and Other Writings by Arnold Bax, it also includes photographs and some letters. Another compendium of primary source material is Cuchullan Among the Guns (1998), a selection of letters from Bax's correspondence with the British conductor Christopher Whelen, edited by Dennis Andrews.A significant event in Bax musicology was the publication of Graham Parlett's exhaustive list of Bax's works entitled A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax (1999). Recognising Parlett's achievement and contribution, Bax musicologists have now started to use his chronological numbering system as a universal system of reference (e.g. Bax's celebrated Third Symphony would be "Parlett #297" or simply P. 297). The doctoral dissertation of Dr. Paul R. Ludden and the M. Litt. dissertation of Thomas Elnaes (University of Dublin, Trinity College, 2006) use the succinct Parlett Numbers exclusively. As a composer Graham Parlett has also edited and orchestrated several Bax scores, including the Russian Suite and the film music to Oliver Twist.Relationship With Harriet CohenHarriet Cohen was one of the most famous concert pianists of the first half of the twentieth century and probably the finest player of Bach of her generation. She premiered many new works some of which were both written and dedicated to her by composers including Vaughan Williams, Elgar, Bartok, Manuel de Falla, William Walton, John Ireland and Arnold Bax. Cohen introduced to the Western world unknown Russian composers such as Shostakovich, Kabalevsky and Polvinkin, and did more than any other musician to revive 16th century Elizabethan music. Cohen, born in London, studied at the Royal Academy of Music under Tobias Matthay having won the Ada Lewis scholarship at the age of 12.From 1921 after Harriet Cohen made her debut at the Queen’s Hall she was entrusted to play all the first performances of Bax’s piano works because of “the gem of deep emotional expression” in her music. Cohen had commenced premiering some of Bax’s new works back in 1916 with “Legend for Violin and Piano” and “Ballad for Violin and Piano”.“One day I will let my music give itself up to love – love without strife or fret or circumstances – just the praise to you”. "music and Men" by Helen Fry page 69  “My mouth longs for your soft mouth and the pink petals of your beautiful breasts”. "Music and Men" by Helen Fry page 71  These are just two quotes from the recently published love letters between Sir Arnold Bax and Harriet Cohen.Harriet Cohen’s love affair with Arnold Bax lasted for over forty years until he died in 1953. It was Arnold Bax who gave Harriet Cohen the name “Tania” for which she was affectionately known by close friends and family. Their passionate affair started in 1914 when she was 19 and he was 31, although they had met two years earlier. Bax was creatively inspired by Cohen and in 1915 wrote for her within 13 days three pieces including “The Princess’s Rose Garden”, “The Maiden with the Daffodil” and “In the Vodka Shop”. "Music and Men" by Helen Fry page 36 Many believe that their time together inspired his famous tone-poem Tintagel castle in which he expressed his anguish at “the dream their world denied”. Their insatiable love led to Bax’s decision to leave his wife and children in 1918, but they could never live together because Bax’s wife refused a divorce. Neither could their relationship be recognised publicly because of the social climate of their generation. Cohen did became pregnant with Bax’s child in 1919  "Music and Men" by Helen Fry page 87  but she lost the child in pregnancy. Harriet Cohen’s recently released letters reveal the turbulence and anguish of their separation and love. It is likely that the long standing affair denied her becoming a “Dame”.On 23 September 1947, Bax's wife Elsa died. Cohen would probably have expected to finally marry Bax after an affair that had now lasted 30 years. However events were to unfold quite differently. Bax did not even tell Cohen about the death of his wife. In fact she was only to discover this in May 1948 at a time when she was practising and recording with Bax the music that he had written for the film "Oliver Twist". She only found out about Elsa's death when her Will was published but there was another shock for Cohen. Bax revealed to Cohen that he had another secret twenty year love affair with Mary Gleaves and was making no promises to marry anyone. "Music and Men" by Helen Fry page 274  This was a time that whilst Cohen was losing prominence in Britain she was playing to huge acclaim in America and Internationally. On discovering Bax's affair with Gleaves in May 1948 Cohen had an accident with a tray of glasses which severed the artery in her right hand thus restricting if not practically ending her performing career.Helen Fry in her book "Music and Men" has attempted to piece together what happened using letters in the British Library. She explores the theory that this was more a "cry for help" than an accident. Interestingly there is no mention of the event in Cohen's own autobiography "A bundle of time" (published posthumously in 1969) which is quite striking given that it effectively ended her career.Bax response to the "accident" was both supportive and caring. He wrote for her a new piece - The concertante for the left-hand. "Music and Men" by Helen Fry page 275  Harriet Cohen premiered the work on 4 July 1950 at the Sixth Cheltenham Festival of Concert English Music with the Halle Orchestra under John Barbirolli. On 25 July 1950 she performed the Concertante again at a prom concert in the Royal Albert Hall with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The Daily Telegraph reported that Composer and pianist were enthusiastically applauded afterwards.Bax died 3 October 1953. Harriet Cohen was deeply affected by his death and it was the moment she had always dreaded. Bax's will bequeathed half of his interest from his literary and musical compositions to Cohen for life and half to Mary Gleaves. After their death that passed to his children. Cohen also kept the property that Bax had bought her. In fact throughout Cohen's life Bax had always financially assisted Cohen. Image:music_and_men_book_cover_by_The_History_Press.jpg|Music and Men by Helen Fry, Published by The History Press RecordingsAfter his death, Bax's music fell into decline. Bax had maintained that his was a Romantic outlook and distanced himself from musical modernism and especially Arnold Schoenberg's Serialism, which was embraced by institutions world wide. He was increasingly pigeon-holed as a 'musical pastoralist' together with Vaughan-Williams and others, and this style fell out of fashion with orchestras.Because of this decline, Bax's music was slow to reach recording. As late as the mid-sixties, there were only two recordings of his symphonies, one long deleted and the other on an obscure label. But from 1966 onwards, a revival of his music began with a series of recordings on Richard Itter's Lyrita Label. By the centenary of his birth, in 1983 much of his music was available in modern recordings. In 2003, Chandos released a new stereo album of the complete scores to Oliver Twist and Malta G.C.. The Lyrita recordings of the First and Seventh Symphonies were re-issued by Lyrita in 2006. The Lyrita recording of the Sixth Symphony, only previously available on LP, was re-issued in June 2007. The Lyrita recordings of the Second and Fifth Syymphonies, only previously available on LP, were re-issued by Lyrita in February 2008.Naxos Records have released a complete cycle of Bax’s symphonies and tone poems and also much of his chamber music. Chandos Records have also provided two complete symphony cycles. The first, released throughout the 1980s and 1990s with Bryden Thomson and the London Philharmonic Orchestra for all except the Fourth Symphony, which was played by the Ulster Orchestra, and the second, released in 2003, by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra with Vernon Handley. However, even today Bax’s music is not frequently performed in concerts. Although he was an able pianist, Bax's appearances as a performer were few and far between. There are recordings of him partnering with May Harrison and Lionel Tertis in sonatas by Frederick Delius and himself. He made a rare concert appearance at the memorial concert for Peter Warlock in 1930.As of February 2008, one disc is waiting to be issued, though a release date has not yet been announced - a second disc of Tone-Poems from Vernon Handley and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra (Chandos).WorksBalletsTamara (1911, orch. 2000)From Dusk till Dawn (1917)The Truth about the Russian Dancers
