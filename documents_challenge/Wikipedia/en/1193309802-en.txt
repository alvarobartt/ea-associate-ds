Last position = NC | Markus Winkelhock (born June 13, 1980 in Stuttgart Bad Cannstatt, Germany) is a German racing driver, who has taken part in one Formula One Grand Prix, which he briefly led. He is the son of the late Manfred Winkelhock and nephew of Joachim Winkelhock, both of whom were Formula One drivers in the 1980s. Early careerMarkus won races in a string of junior formulae including Formula König, German Formula Renault and the Formula Renault Eurocup from 1998-2000. In 2001, Winkelhock joined the German Formula 3 Championship, where he remained until the championship became the F3 Euroseries in 2003. His record was fifth overall in 2001 (three wins), seventh in 2002 (one win) and fourth in 2003 (two wins).He switched to touring car racing in 2004, with a season in the DTM in an AMG-Mercedes CLK. But he failed to score a point all year with the Persson team.Winkelhock switched back to single-seater racing in 2005, joining the World Series by Renault with Draco. He won three times but there were also some less than shining moments - notably when he crashed at Monaco in qualifying and on the first lap of the race.Formula OneOn January 24 2006, Marcus Winkelhock was confirmed a test and reserve driver in the Midland F1 team, (formerly Jordan Grand Prix) for the  Formula One season. He participated in Friday test sessions for the team at the Bahrain, Australian, German and Hungarian Grands Prix.He was re-signed for  by the team, now in its Spyker F1 guise. He also made a brief return to the DTM in 2007, starting three races.Following Christijan Albers' departure from Spyker after the 2007 British Grand Prix, Winkelhock was confirmed as his replacement for the European Grand Prix on July 18. The deal was only for one race with Sakon Yamamoto set to race for Spyker for the rest of the season.Leads on Grand Prix debutWinkelhock qualified last on the 22-car grid alongside team mate Adrian Sutil. But on the formation lap with the rest of the field already on dry-weather tyres, the team made a last-second decision to call Winkelhock into the pits to switch to intermediate tyres. When pouring rain forced almost all the others to pit at the end of the first lap, Winkelhock was able to move into the lead, passing some cars as they pitted, and even passing Kimi Räikkönen on the track as the Finn tip-toed around to the pits, eventually building a lead of 33 seconds by the end of the second lap. By lap 4 he had a lead of 1:55.714 over Ferrari's Felipe Massa in 2nd place.As the rain got heavier the race stewards first sent out the safety car, and then suspended the race following a series of spin-offs in the first corner behind the safety car. The race re-started after the rain had eased. Winkelhock and his team chose to start on full wet tyres on a drying track in the hope of further showers, as the team expected he would be overtaken by faster cars anyway. The gamble failed and, having re-started the race from pole position, Winkelhock quickly fell down the order. He retired on lap 15 with hydraulic problems that caused a small fire. He had led for a total of six laps. According to Bob Varsha of the US SPEED Channel commentary team, Winkelhock is the only driver in Formula One history to start last on the grid and lead the race in his first Grand Prix, and due to the red flag and restart, is also the only driver in Formula One history to start both last and first on the grid in the same Grand Prix.Despite leading his debut race, the Spyker team eventually opted against giving Winkelhock a drive for the remainder of the 2007 season for sponsorship reasons, and instead decided to give the drive to former Super Aguri driver Sakon Yamamoto.Post-Formula One career(Team Rosberg) in the 2008 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season.]]Winkelhock returned to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters after he lost his Spyker seat, and has remained in the series for 2008.Racing recordCareer summarySeasonSeriesTeam NameRacesPolesWinsPointsFinal Placing1998Formula König?9231612nd1999Formula Renault Germany]]SL Formula RacingLechner Racing812724th2000Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup]]???1786thFormula Renault 2000 Italy]]SL Racing400821st2001German Formula Three]]Mücke Motorsport20231415thMasters of Formula Three]]?100N/A36th2002German Formula Three]]Mücke Motorsport1821287th2003Formula Three EuroseriesMücke Motorsport2012714thMasters of Formula Three]]?100N/A6th2004Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]]Team Persson11000NC2005World Series by Renault]]Draco Multiracing USA]]17131143rd2006Formula One]]Midland]]Test driverPorsche SupercupPorsche AG1000NC2007Formula One]]Spyker]]100026thDeutsche Tourenwagen MastersAudi Sport Team Abt Sportsline]]2000NCFuturecom TME50002008Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]]Team Rosberg6006*9th** - season in progress.Complete Formula One results(key)YrEntrantChassisEngine123456789101112131415161718WDCPoints2006]]MF1 RacingMidland]] M16Toyota]] RVX-06 2.4 V8BHRTDMAL]]AUSTDSMR]]EUR]]ESP]]MON]]GBR]]CAN]]USA]]FRA]]GERTDHUNTDTUR]]ITA]]CHN]]JPN]]BRA]]--2007]]Etihad]] Aldar Spyker F1 TeamSpyker]] F8-VIIFerrari]] 056H 2.4 V8AUS]]MAL]]BHR]]ESP]]MON]]CAN]]USA]]FRA]]GBR]]EURRetHUN]]TUR]]ITA]]BEL]]JPN]]CHN]]BRA]]N/A0ReferencesExternal linksOfficial websiteMarkus Winkelhock's career statistics at Driver DatabaseWho's Who: Markus Winkelhock at F1Fanatic Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:German racecar drivers Category:German Formula One drivers Category:Spyker Formula One drivers Category:Italian Formula Renault 2.0 drivers Category:German Formula Renault 2.0 drivers Category:World Series by Renault drivers Category:DTM drivers Category:German Formula Three Championship drivers Category:Formula Three Euroseries driversast:Markus Winkelhock ca:Markus Winkelhock cs:Markus Winkelhock de:Markus Winkelhock es:Markus Winkelhock fr:Markus Winkelhock id:Markus Winkelhock it:Markus Winkelhock lv:Markuss Vinkelhoks hu:Markus Winkelhock nl:Markus Winkelhock ja:マルクス・ヴィンケルホック no:Markus Winkelhock pl:Markus Winkelhock pt:Markus Winkelhock ru:Винкельхок, Маркус sl:Markus Winkelhock fi:Markus Winkelhock sv:Markus Winkelhock uk:Вінкельхок Маркус zh:马库斯·温克霍克
