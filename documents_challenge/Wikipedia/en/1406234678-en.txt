Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity over time. In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s2), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (\,).Mathematical definitionThe angular acceleration can be defined as either: = \frac = \frac , or  = \frac_ ,where  is the angular velocity, \mathbf_ is the linear tangential acceleration, and r is the radius of curvature.Equations of motionFor rotational motion, Newton's second law can be adapted to describe the relation between torque and angular acceleration: = I\  ,where  is the total torque exerted on the body, and I is the mass moment of inertia of the body.Constant accelerationFor all constant values of the torque, , of an object, the angular acceleration will also be constant. For this special case of constant angular acceleration, the above equation will produce a definitive, constant value for the angular acceleration: = \frac .Non-constant accelerationFor any non-constant torque, the angular acceleration of an object will change with time. The equation becomes a differential equation instead of a constant value. This differential equation is known as the equation of motion of the system and can completely describe the motion of the object.See alsoAngular momentumAngular speedAngular velocityRotationSpinReferences External linksCategory:Physical quantitiesbs:Ugaono ubrzanje cs:Úhlové zrychlení de:Winkelbeschleunigung es:Aceleración angular fr:Accélération angulaire ko:각가속도 hr:Kutno ubrzanje it:Accelerazione angolare ms:Pecutan sudut nl:Hoekversnelling no:Vinkelakselerasjon pl:Przyspieszenie kątowe pt:Aceleração angular ru:Угловое ускорение sk:Uhlové zrýchlenie sl:Kotni pospešek fi:Kulmakiihtyvyys tr:Açısal ivme uk:Кутове прискорення zh:角加速度
