The Double-barred Finch Taeniopygia bichenovii is an estrildid finch found in dry savanna, tropical (lowland) dry grassland and shrubland habitats in northern and eastern Australia. They are sometimes referred to as Bicheno's Finch; and also as Owl Finch, owing to the dark ring of feathers around their faces.The name of the species commemorate James Ebenezer Bicheno, a colonial secretary of Van Diemen's Land appointed in September 1842.CharacteristicsThis is a 10-11cm long munia-like finch with a white face bordered with black, brown upperparts and throat, and white underparts. The throat and underparts are separated by another black line. The wings are patterned in brown and white. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller and browner. A less common sub-species with brown or black underparts is known to exist. The call is a soft tet or a louder peew, and the song is a soft fluting.These gregarious seed-eating birds build their nests in grass, a bush or low tree, and lay four eggs.References Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concernFinches and Sparrows by Clement, Harris and Davis, ISBN 0-7136-8017-2Category:Taeniopygia Category:Birds of Australia Category:Birds of Western Australiade:Ringelastrild es:Taeniopygia bichenovii fr:Diamant de Bichenov hu:Rácsosszárnyú asztrild nl:Bichenowastrilde pl:Amadynka białolica zh:雙斑草雀
