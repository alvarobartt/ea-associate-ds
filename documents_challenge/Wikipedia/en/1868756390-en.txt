, Florence]]Taddeo Gaddi (c. 1300 &ndash; 1366) was an Italian painter and architect, active during the early Renaissance. As a painter, he created altar-pieces and murals and is primarily noted as a pupil and follower of Giotto. As an architect, he is credited with the design of the Ponte Vecchio.Life and artSon of Gaddo Gaddi, an artist of whom little is known, Taddeo's art education came primarily as a pupil of, and assistant to, the painter Giotto di Bondone. Cennino Cennini referred to Taddeo as Giotto's godson and claimed that their relationship lasted 24 years.http://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaddi/taddeo/biograph.htmlEarly works such as the The Stigmatization of Saint Francis (c.1325-1330, tempera on wood panel) demonstrate a subtle recasting of Giotto's style.Perhaps his most famous works are the series of frescoes depicting the lives of the Virgin and of Christ in the Giugni Chapel (née Baroncelli Chapel) at Santa Croce in Florence (1328-38). The Angelic Announcement to the Shepherds (depicted at right) illustrates Taddeo's interest in light and its effects. His study of solar eclipses in particular would eventually lead to serious eye injury in 1339.http://www.wga.hu/html/g/gaddi/taddeo/4announc.html As an architect, Taddeo Gaddi is credited with the design of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, as well as the neighbouring Ponte Santa Trinita, which was destroyed in the 16th century.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06332b.htmTwo facts point to Taddeo Gaddi's importance as a Florentine artist:Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Taddeo Gaddi in his Lives.Taddeo's name appears atop a list of 'the best masters of painting who are in Florence'.http://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaddi/taddeo/biograph.htmlTaddeo Gaddi produced four sons, three of whom were known artists: Giovanni Gaddi, Agnolo Gaddi and Niccolò Gaddi. There is no evidence to demonstrate that his fourth son, Zanobi, was ever a serious artist.References Category:1300 births Category:1366 deaths Category:People from the Province of Florence Category:Italian painters Category:Tuscan painters Category:Gothic paintersca:Taddeo Gaddi de:Taddeo Gaddi es:Taddeo Gaddi fr:Taddeo Gaddi hr:Taddeo Gaddi it:Taddeo Gaddi nl:Taddeo Gaddi ja:タッデオ・ガッディ no:Taddeo Gaddi pl:Taddeo Gaddi pt:Taddeo Gaddi ru:Гадди, Таддео sl:Taddeo Gaddi fi:Taddeo Gaddi sv:Taddeo Gaddi
