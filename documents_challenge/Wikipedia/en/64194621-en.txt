Lecce will play in the Italian Serie A for the 2008-09 season, after winning promtion from the Serie B in the 2007-08 season.The club was formed in 1908 and has spent a large part of its seasons bouncing between Italy's second division and Serie A, where the team gained its first promotion in 1985.The team plays in red and yellow stripes. Lecce's home games are played in the 36,285-seater Stadio Via del Mare. Lecce players and fans are referred to as salentini.HistoryLecce was founded as Sporting Club Lecce on 15 March 1908,Player History - Lecce formed 1908 initially the club comprise of football, track-and-field and cycling sports. The first club president was Francesco Marangi. The first colours worn by Lecce during this time were black and white stripes, known in Italy as bianconeri.In its formative years, Lecce played in mostly regional leagues and competitions. During the 1923/24 season the club broke up, before coming back on 16 September 1927 as Unione Sportiva Lecce. The club were still wearing black and white stripes (similar to Juventus) at this point, and the first president under the name Unione Sportiva Lecce was Luigi Lopez y Rojo.League: Early years 1930s, 40s and 50sTaranto Sport played Lecce in a game for promotion to Serie B from the local Southern Italian league, Lecce were victorious winning 3-2 after extra time. They were entered into Serie B for the 1929/30 season, the first game they played in the league was against Novara Calcio on 6 October 1929 , which they won 2-1. They would eventually finished 13th. But for the second time in the clubs history, it sized activity at the end of the 1931-32 season.Four years later, Lecce came back and went into Serie C, finishing 11th in their return season. Around this time the club was in turmoil, the following season they withdrew from Serie C after four days, and then during the 1938-39 season they finished in 3rd place but were moved down to 12th after it was revealed that the club had violated the league's federal regulations.The club finished 1st during the 1943-44 season, but club football was suspended for the Second World War. Non the less, when club football resumed they finished as champions of Serie C once more, gaining promotion back into Serie B. Two decent seasons followed (finishing 4th and 3rd in respective seasons), with star Silvestri scoring 20 goals in one season, before the club were relegated.Lecce stayed down in Serie C for six seasons during this period, though this was not a particularly successful time for the club, striker Anselmo Bislenghi scored 83 goals for the club during this period, thus becoming a hero. The club slipped even lower to Serie IV where they spent three years.Seventeen seasons of Serie C: 1960s, 70s and 80sFrom 1959 to 1975, Lecce had seventeen seasons in Serie C. They came extremely close to promotion several times during that period, finishing second three seasons in a row (1971-72, 1972-73, 1973-74) before gaining promotion in the 1975-76 season.The same year as their promotion Lecce tasted cup success, winning the Coppa Italia Serie C. In 1976 Lecce took part in the Anglo-Italian Semiprofessional Cup, notching up a 4-0 victory against Scarborough F.C.,- RSSSF ].During 1980, a scandal which rocked Italian football, Lecce under president Franco Jurlano occurred. However, Jurlano was able to demonstrate his innocence and the scandal only lead to disqualification of the player Claudius Merlo. The club was struck by a tragedy in 1983, players Michele Lo Russo and Ciro Pezzella died in an automotive accident. To this day, Lo Russo remains the club record holder for most number of appearances with 415.Promotion to Serie A: mid-1980s and 90sUnder the management of Eugenio Fascetti, Lecce would achieve promotion to Serie A for the first time in 1985. They finished bottom and were relegated after only one season, but defeated Roma 3-2 away in the penultimate game to deal a fatal blow to Roma's title hopes. Losing a promotion play-off 2-1 to Cesena the following season, they would return to Serie A in 1988.Under Carlo Mazzone, Lecce finished a respectable 9th place in 1989. Stars of the side included striker Pedro Pasculli and midfielders Antonio Conte and Paolo Benedetti. They lasted three seasons before relegation, and returned two years later. Season 1993-94 saw Lecce finish last with a pitiful 11 points, the lowest ever of any Serie A team, and a second relegation came the following year. ]] Giampiero Ventura saw Lecce achieve successive promotions before leaving for Cagliari. Once more, it proved a struggle in Serie A despite the best efforts of striker Francesco Palmieri and a famous away win against Milan on October 19, 1997. Nonetheless the team were good enough to return to Serie A in 1999 and begin another three-year stint in the top-flight, with yet another return to Serie A in 2003. In 2004, under Delio Rossi, who had been managing the club since 2002, Lecce achieved an impressive result, reaching the 9th final position after an awful first half of the season. Famous performances include two sensactional victories in a row, first against Italian giants Juventus 4-3 in Turin and then against Inter 2-1 in Lecce. This helped the club to finish in 10th position. The following season in 2004-05 Zdenek Zeman oversaw a highly attack-minded team which scored plenty of goals, they ended up in 10th position, putting in the spotlight talents like Valeri Bojinov and Mirko Vucinic. Lecce had the second best attack with 66 goals (Juventus came first with 67 goals) and the worst defence with 73 goal. This is a record, as for the first time the team with the worst defence managed to survive in the history of Serie A.Relegation, consolidation and promotionThe 2005-06 was a continual struggle for Lecce. The club has changed its manager two times (Silvio Baldini for Angelo Adamo Gregucci, and then to youth team coach Roberto Rizzo supported by goalkeeper coach Franco Paleari). The numerous managerial moves could not turn Lecce's fortune as they were relegated in 19th place. In June Giovanni Semeraro returned at the helm of the club after 9 months. The club re-appointed Zdenek Zeman as manager, just one year after he had left for Brescia.Lecce were unable to avoid relegation from Serie A despite some initial hope due to the Serie A match-fixing scandal. The club had a mixed start to the 2006-07 season in Serie B, winning three home games (including a win against early league leaders, Genoa), though they have suffered poor away form. After a large drop in form, recording 10 losses in 18 matches, Zdenek Zeman was sacked as manager and replaced by Giuseppe Papadopulo. On March 10, 2007 Lecce clinched a historical victory over Frosinone, beaten 5-0 at Stadio Via del Mare. Having gained 36 points in the second-leg part of the season, Lecce ended the season in the middle of the table (9th place).The 2007-08 season saw Lecce fight for a place in the Italian Serie A for the next season. Despite earning 83 points (12 more than sixth-placed Pisa) and boasting the best defence in the tournament, the giallorossi were forced to face play-offs for promotion in the top flight. In the semi final they beat Pisa in both legs (1-0 away and 2-1 at home) to secure a place in the final against AlbinoLeffe. Then they won the first leg 1-0 away, before securing a 1-1 draw in the second leg at the Via del Mare to gain promotion. After insisting rumors, Papadopulo quit due to a difference of opinion with the general manager of the club. Mario Beretta replaced him.Current squadAs of 2008-09-01                                    Notable former players  Marco Amelia Paolo Benedetti Sergio Brio Pasquale Bruno Marco Cassetti Franco Causio Antonio Conte Francesco Cozza Samuele Dalla Bona Alberto Di Chiara Stefano Di Chiara Marco Donadel Matteo Ferrari Luigi Garzya Giuseppe Giannini Fabrizio Lorieri Cristiano Lucarelli Francesco Moriero Salvatore Nobile Francesco Palmieri Graziano Pellè Marco Pecoraro Scanio Ezio Rossi Roberto Rizzo Max Tonetto Pietro Paolo Virdis Juan Alberto Barbas Cristian Ledesma Pedro Pablo Pasculli Juárez Francisco Lima Mazinho Luís Carlos Tóffoli Valeri Bojinov Davor Vugrinec Danny Dichio Alexei Eremenko Wilfried Dalmat István Vincze Gheorghe Popescu  Mirko Vučinić David Sesa Klas Ingesson Javier Chevantón  Sergei Aleinikov Massimo Margiotta  Dejan GovedaricaSee Also: Category:U.S. Lecce playersHonours and Club RecordsSerie BPromoted - 1984-85, 1987-88, 1992-93, 1996-97, 1998-99, 2002-03, 2007-08Serie CChampions - 1945-46, 1975-76, 1995-96Coppa Italia Serie CChampions - 1975-76Anglo-Italian Semiprofessional CupChampions - 1976-77Youth Team HonoursCampionato PrimaveraChampions - 2002-2003, 2003-2004Coppa Italia PrimaveraChampions - 2001-2002, 2004-2005Supercoppa PrimaveraChampions - 2003-2004, 2004-2005Player recordsAll-time Top 10 Lecce GoalscorersPlayerGoalsItaly Anselmo Bislenghi87Italy Franco Cardinali66Argentina Pedro Pasculli54Italy Aurelio De Marco50Italy Gaetano Montenegro49Uruguay Javier Chevantón45Italy Luigi Silvestri45Italy Pietro De Santis43 Ennio Fiaschi40Italy Giancarlo Ferrari36Stadium InformationName - Stadio Via del MareCity - LecceCapacity - 36,285Inauguration - 1966Pitch Size - 105 x 70 metresReferencesExternal linksLecce's official website Lecce statistics    Category:U.S. Lecce Category:Italian football clubs Category:Football clubs in Apulia Category:Apulia Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1908 Category:Italian football (soccer) First Division clubs Category:Serie A clubs Category:Serie B clubs Category:Serie C1 clubsar:نادي ليتشي bg:Лече (отбор) cs:US Lecce de:US Lecce et:US Lecce es:Unione Sportiva Lecce fr:US Lecce ko:US 레체 id:U.S. Lecce it:Unione Sportiva Lecce nl:US Lecce ja:USレッチェ no:US Lecce pl:US Lecce pt:Unione Sportiva Lecce ru:Лечче (футбольный клуб) sr:FK Leče fi:US Lecce sv:US Lecce zh:莱切足球俱乐部
