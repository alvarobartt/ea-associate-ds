  The estrildid finches are small passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They can be classified as the family Estrildidae (weaver-finch) or as a sub-group within the family Passeridae, which also includes the true sparrows.They are gregarious and often colonial seed-eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but vary widely in plumage colours and pattern.All the estrildids build large domed nests and lay 5–10 white eggs. Many species build roost nests. Some of the fire-finches and pytilias are hosts to the brood-parasitic indigobirds and whydahs respectively.Most are sensitive to cold and require a warm, usually tropical, habitat, although a few have adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia.The smallest species of the family is the Fernando Po Oliveback (Nesocharis shelleyi) at a mere 8.3 cm (3.3 inches), although the lightest species is the Black-rumped Waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes) at 6 g. The largest species is the Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora), at 17 cm (6.7 inches) and 25 g.Species listAntpeckers, genus ParmoptilaJameson's Antpecker, Woodhouse's Antpecker, Negrofinches, genus NigritaWhite-breasted Negrofinch, Chestnut-breasted Negrofinch,  [[Image:Chestnut-breasted Mannikin444.jpg|thumb|250px|Cheastnut-breasted Mannikin, Lonchura castaneothorax]]Pale-fronted Negrofinch, Grey-headed Negrofinch, Olivebacks, genus NesocharisWhite-collared Oliveback, Fernando Po Oliveback, Grey-headed Oliveback, Pytilias, genus Orange-winged Pytilia, Red-winged Pytilia, Green-winged Pytilia, Red-faced Pytilia, Genus MandingoaGreen-backed Twinspot, Crimson-wings, genus CryptospizaRed-faced Crimson-wing, Abyssinian Crimson-wing, Dusky Crimson-wing, Shelley's Crimson-wing, Seedcrackers, genus PyrenestesCrimson Seedcracker, Black-bellied Seedcracker, Lesser Seedcracker, Bluebills, genus SpermophagaGrant's Bluebill, Western Bluebill, Red-headed Bluebill, Twinspots, genera Clytospiza, Hypargos, EuschistospizaBrown Twinspot, Peters' Twinspot, Pink-throated Twinspot, Dybowski's Twinspot, Dusky Twinspot, Firefinches, genus LagonostictaBar-breasted Firefinch, Brown Firefinch, Red-billed Firefinch, Black-bellied Firefinch, African Firefinch, Pale-billed Firefinch, Jameson's Firefinch, Mali Firefinch, Rock Firefinch, Black-throated FirefinchReichenow's Firefinch, Cordon-bleus, genus UraeginthusBlue-breasted Cordon-bleu, Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu, Blue-capped Cordon-bleu, Purple Grenadier, Common Grenadier,  also known as Violet-eared WaxbillWaxbills, genus EstrildaLavender Waxbill, Black-tailed Waxbill, Cinderella Waxbill, Swee Waxbill also known as Yellow-bellied WaxbillFawn-breasted WaxbillAnambra Waxbill, Orange-cheeked Waxbill, Arabian Waxbill, Crimson-rumped Waxbill, Black-rumped Waxbill, Common Waxbill, Black-lored Waxbill, Black-crowned Waxbill, Black-headed Waxbill, Black-cheeked Waxbill, Red-rumped Waxbill, Avadavats, genus AmandavaRed Avadavat,  also known as Red MuniaGreen Avadavat, Zebra Waxbill,  also known as Orange-breasted WaxbillQuailfinches, genus OrtygospizaRed-billed Quailfinch, African Quailfinch, Locustfinch, Firetails, genera Emblema, Stagonopleura, OreostruthusPainted Firetail, Beautiful Firetail, Red-eared Firetail, Diamond Firetail, Mountain Firetail, Genus NeochmiaRed-browed Firetail, Crimson Finch, Star Finch, Plum-headed Finch,  also known as Cherry FinchGenus TaeniopygiaZebra Finch, Chestnut-eared Finch, Double-barred Finch,  also known as Bicheno Finch or Owl FinchGenus PoephilaMasked Finch, Long-tailed Finch, Black-throated Finch, Parrotfinches, genus ErythruraTawny-breasted Parrotfinch, Pin-tailed Parrotfinch, Green-faced Parrotfinch, Tricolored Parrotfinch, Blue-faced Parrotfinch, Red-eared Parrotfinch, Papuan Parrotfinch, Red-throated Parrotfinch, Fiji Parrotfinch, Red-headed Parrotfinch, Royal Parrotfinch, Pink-billed Parrotfinch, Genus Gouldian Finch, Munias and Silverbills, genus LonchuraMadagascar Munia, African Silverbill, Indian Silverbill,  also known as White-throated MuniaGrey-headed Silverbill, Bronze Mannikin,  also known as Bronze MuniaBlack-and-white Mannikin,  also known as Black-and-white MuniaBrown-backed Mannikin,  also known as Brown-backed MuniaMagpie Mannikin,  also known as Magpie MuniaWhite-rumped Munia, Javan Munia, Dusky Munia, Black-faced Munia, Black-throated Munia,  also known as Jerdon's MannikinScaly-breasted Munia,  also known as Nutmeg Mannikin or Spice FinchWhite-bellied Munia, Streak-headed Munia, L. t. tristissimaL. t. leucostictaBlack-headed Munia,  also known as Chestnut MuniaTricoloured Munia, White-capped Munia, Cream-bellied Munia, Five-colored Munia, White-headed Munia, Pale-headed Munia, Grand Munia, Grey-banded Munia, Grey-crowned Munia, Hooded Munia, Grey-headed Munia, Mottled Munia, New Ireland Munia, New Hanover Munia, Yellow-rumped Munia, Chestnut-breasted Munia, Black Munia, Black-breasted Munia, Snow Mountain Munia, Alpine Munia, Bismarck Munia, Genus Pictorella Munia, Java Sparrows, genus Java Sparrow, Timor Dusky Sparrow, Cut-throats, genus AmadinaCut-throat, Red-headed Finch ==External links==Estrildid Finch videos on the Internet Bird Collection* Category:Bird familiesca:Estríldid de:Prachtfinken es:Estrildidae eo:Estrildedoj fr:Estrildidae is:Strildi it:Estrildidae sw:Kitenduli lt:Astrildiniai hu:Díszpintyfélék nl:Prachtvinken ja:カエデチョウ族 (Sibley) pl:Astryldy pt:Estrildinae ru:Вьюрковые ткачики fi:Loistopeipot sv:Astrilder vi:Họ Chim di
