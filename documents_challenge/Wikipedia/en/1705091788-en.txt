This technology allows screeners to tell if passengers are carrying hidden weapons, explosives or drugs by allowing them to see through passengers' clothing. For this reason, these devices, which are available both as freestanding equipment and mobile 'cameras' have been dubbed 'naked machines' by some civil rights advocates[http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2004/05/63450?currentPage=all "Getting Naked for Big Brother", Wired, by Kim Zetter], 17 May 2004, link accessed 28 June 2007. concerned that the devices essentially show screeners nude images of passengers and have been deployed without making passengers aware of this infringement on their privacy.Airline LoungesBritish AirwaysExecutive ClubUnited AirlinesRed Carpet ClubUS AirwaysUS Airways ClubMilitary FacilitiesPHX is also home to Phoenix Air National Guard Base and the 161st Air Refueling Wing (161 ARW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the Arizona Air National Guard flying the KC-135R Stratotanker.Aircraft accidents and incidentsSky Harbor has not had any major accidents occur at or near the airport.
