 Pitchfork Media, usually known simply as Pitchfork, is a Chicago-based daily Internet publication devoted to music criticism and commentary, music news, and artist interviews. Its focus is on independent music,&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[indie rock]]. However, the range of musical [[genre]]s covered extends to [[electronic music|electronic]], [[pop music|pop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[dance music|dance]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]] and [[experimental music]].The site, which was established in 1995, concentrates on new music, but Pitchfork journalists also review reissued albums and box sets. The site has also published "best-of" lists – such as the best albums of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and the best songs of the 1960s – as well as annual features detailing the best singles and albums of each year between 1999 and 2007.HistoryPitchfork was created in Minneapolis, Minnesota in late 1995 by Ryan Schreiber, then just out of high school. Influenced by local fanzines and college radio station KUOM, Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for independent music. At first bearing the name Turntable, the site was originally updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily, and was renamed "Pitchfork", a reference to Tony Montana's tattoo in the 1983 film Scarface.&lt;/ref&gt;In early 1999, Schreiber uprooted Pitchfork from its Minneapolis base and relocated to Chicago, Illinois. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for both its extensive coverage of underground music and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of print journalism. In October of that year, the site added a daily music news section.Size, readership and site traffic Pitchfork now receives an audience of more than 240,000 readers per day, and more than 1.5 million unique visitors per month, making it the most popular independent-focused music publication online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;On October 24, 2003, the author of Pitchformula.com reported that Pitchfork had published 5,575 reviews from 158 different authors, with an average length of just over 520 words. Together, the reviews featured a total of 2,901,650 words.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this data was recorded in 2003; since that point the site has continued to release reviews on an almost daily basis (excluding weekends and public holidays).InfluencePitchfork's opinions have gained increased cultural currency in recent years; some in the mainstream media view the site as a barometer of the independent music scene, and positive quotes from its reviews are increasingly used in press releases and affixed to the front of CDs.Since the popular resurgence of "indie" music in 2004, some publications  have cited Pitchfork in having played a part in "breaking" artists such as Arcade Fire, Sufjan Stevens, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Interpol, The Go! Team, Junior Boys, The Books, Broken Social Scene, Cold War Kids, Wolf Parade, Tapes 'n Tapes, and Titus Andronicus although the site's true impact on their popularity remains a source of frequent debate.Conversely, Pitchfork has also been seen as being a negative influence on some indie artists. As suggested in a Washington Post article in April 2006, Pitchfork's reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity, especially if it had previously only been available to a limited audience or had been released on an independent record label. A dismissive 0.0 review of former Dismemberment Plan frontman Travis Morrison's Travistan album led to a large sales drop and a virtual college radio blacklist. On the other hand, "an endorsement from Pitchfork – which dispenses its approval one-tenth of a point at a time, up to a maximum of 10 points – is very valuable, indeed."ExamplesArcade Fire is among the bands most commonly cited to have benefited from a Pitchfork review. In a 2005 Chicago Tribune article, a Merge Records employee states, "After the Pitchfork review, Funeral went out of print for about a week because we got so many orders for the record."&lt;/ref&gt;Clap Your Hands Say Yeah member Lee Sargent has discussed the impact of Pitchfork's influence on their album, saying, "The thing about a publication like Pitchfork is that they can decide when that happens. You know what I mean? They can say, 'We're going to speed up the process and this is going to happen...now!' And it was a kick in the pants for us, because we lost control of everything."&lt;/ref&gt;The manager of Tapes 'n Tapes claims that the band has benefited directly from a positive review in Pitchfork, in addition to the band's live shows and a mention in The New York Times.CriticismAlong with its popularity, Pitchfork has attracted criticism.One common complaint is that the site's journalism suffers from a narrow view of independent music, favoring lo-fi and often obscure indie rock and giving only cursory treatment to other genres.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that the site's opinions reflect a &quot;[[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]&quot; attitude, overly subject to changing musical trends, often speaking openly about what is considered &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;uncool&quot; to readers, and attempts to create hype around chosen [[Indie music scenes|scenes]] (such as &quot;[[dance punk]]&quot; or &quot;[[freak folk]]&quot;) or acts (such as [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Arcade Fire]]). Some critics have suggested that the site rates albums from particular music scenes or artists more favorably in order to bolster its influence when the music becomes popular.&lt;ref&gt;Slate. &quot;The Indie Music Site Everyone Loves to Hate&quot;. [http://www.slate.com/id/2154469]&lt;/ref&gt;The majority of criticism, however, is aimed at the site's album reviewing style. Critics argue the site often emphasizes a reviewers' own writing over the actual music being reviewed, sometimes not even reviewing the album and instead criticising the artist's integrity. Pitchfork is also known to give "0.0" ratings, deeming the work as utterly worthless. One critic wrote that Pitchfork's "0.0" rating of a particular album amounts to no more than a "cheap publicity stunt" for a website that "thrives on controversy."Dusted Features [ All Y'All Haters &amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The critic also hypothetically asked how a neo-Nazi punk record would be scored in comparison to these "0.0" albums, based on Pitchfork standardsParodiesWhen Pitchfork asked comedian David Cross to compile a list of his favorite albums, he instead provided them with a list of "Albums to Listen to While Reading Overwrought Pitchfork Reviews". In it, he satirically piled over-the-top praise on fictional indie rock records, mocking Pitchfork Media's reviewing style.&lt;/ref&gt;In 2004, comedy website Something Awful created a parody of Pitchfork's front page. Entitled "RichDork Media", the page makes reference to nonexistent, obscure-sounding indie-rock bands in its reviews, news headlines and advertisements. The rating system measures music on its proximity to the band Radiohead.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar, more light-hearted parody was created by [[Sub Pop]], a record label whose musical artists Pitchfork has reviewed (often favorably).On September 10, 2007, the satirical newspaper The Onion published a story in which Pitchfork Media editor Ryan Schreiber reviews music as a whole, giving it a 6.8 out of 10.&lt;/ref&gt;Leaked musicIn August 2006, a directory on Pitchfork's servers containing over 300 albums was compromised. A web surfer managed to discover and download the collection, which included The Decemberists' The Crane Wife and TV on the Radio's Return to Cookie Mountain, both of which had previously leaked to peer-to-peer networks. Allegedly, one of the albums on the server, Joanna Newsom's Ys, had not been available previously on file-sharing networks.The Joanna Newsom leak - Music - The Phoenix&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Music festivalslogo.]]Intonation Music Festival In 2005, Pitchfork curated the Intonation Music Festival, attracting approximately 15,000 attendees to Chicago's Union Park for a two-day bill featuring performances by 25 acts, including Broken Social Scene, The Decemberists, The Go! Team, and a rare appearance by Les Savy Fav.Pitchfork Music Festival On July 29 and 30, 2006, the publication premiered its own Pitchfork Music Festival in the same park. The event attracted over 18,000 attendees per day. More than 40 bands performed at the inaugural festival, including Spoon and Yo La Tengo, as well as a rare headlining set by reunited Tropicália band Os Mutantes.&lt;/ref&gt;The Pitchfork Music Festival was held again in 2007. It was expanded to three days (Friday, July 13 - Sunday, July 15), with the first day being a collaboration between Pitchfork and the British music festival All Tomorrow's Parties as part of the latter's "Don't Look Back" series, in which seminal artists perform their most legendary albums in their entirety. Performers that evening included Sonic Youth playing Daydream Nation, Slint playing Spiderland, and GZA/Genius playing Liquid Swords. Some of the other artists who performed over the weekend included Yoko Ono, De La Soul, Cat Power, The New Pornographers, Stephen Malkmus, Clipse, Iron &amp; Wine, Girl Talk, Of Montreal, Deerhunter, Dan Deacon, The Ponys, and The Sea and Cake.All Tomorrow's PartiesIn 2008 Pitchfork will again collaborate with All Tomorrow's Parties to curate half of the bill for one of their May festival weekends. This is the first event that Pitchfork has been involved in outside of the United States.Rating systemPitchfork's music reviews use two different rating systems:Individual track reviews were formerly ranked from 1 to 5 stars, but on January 15, 2007, the site introduced a new system called "Forkcast". In it, instead of assigning tracks a particular rating, reviewers simply label them one of the self-explanatory categories "New Music", "Old Music", "Video", "Advanced Music", "Rising", "WTF", the category of their most favorably regarded songs, "On Repeat" and, for the least favored songs, "Delete".Album reviews are given a rating out of 10.0, specific to one decimal point.On October 24, 2003, Pitchformula.comPitchformula.com made a survey of the 5,575 reviews available on Pitchfork at that time, showing that:6.7 was the average rating2,339 reviews had been awarded a rating of 7.4 or higher2,362 reviews had been awarded a rating of between 5.0 and 7.3873 reviews had been awarded a rating of less than 5.0The review for Radiohead's album In Rainbows seems to have taken a satirical approach towards the method of pay that Radiohead utilized for the album. It allows a user to type in their own rating, and when a question mark is clicked, says, "It's up to you" (similar to Radiohead's website). If clicked again, it says, "No really, it's 9.3".Radiohead: In Rainbows: Pitchfork Record Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; British Sea Power's 2008 album Do You Like Rock Music? was awarded a rating of "U.2".British Sea Power: Do You Like Rock Music?: Pitchfork Record ReviewAlbums awarded a 10.0 ratingInitial releaseThe following albums received a 10.0 rating upon initial release:...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead&nbsp;– Source Tags &amp; Codes12 Rods – gay?
