It is also known as the Great Grey Kangaroo and the Forester Kangaroo. Although a big Eastern Grey male typically weighs around 66&nbsp;kg (145&nbsp;lb.) and stands almost 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft.) tall, the scientific name, Macropus giganteus (gigantic large-foot), is misleading, as the Red Kangaroo of the semi-arid inland is larger.DescriptionThe Eastern Grey is easy to recognise: its soft grey coat is distinctive, and it is usually found in moister, more fertile areas than the Red. Indigenous Australian names include iyirrbir (Uw Oykangand and Uw Olkola) and kucha (Pakanh).

It prefers open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter. Like all kangaroos, it is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, and is mostly seen early in the morning, or as the light starts to fade in the evening.In more remote areas, the Eastern Grey occurs in great numbers, and if left unchecked reaches plague proportions. From time to time shooters are employed to reduce its numbers, almost always to the accompaniment of a public outcry. Given the very limited amount of fodder in dry years, however, the only other choice is starvation.SpeedThe Eastern Grey Kangaroo can travel very fast over land. The highest ever recorded speed of any kangaroo was  set by a large female Eastern Grey Kangaroo.StatusIt is often said that kangaroo populations have increased significantly since the European colonisation of Australia because of the increased areas of grassland (as opposed to forest), the reduction in Dingo numbers, and the availability of artificial watering holes. The current estimated population of the species numbers two million.BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Wildfacts - Eastern grey kangaroo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;While the Eastern Grey remains common, there are vast areas of country from which it has been exterminated (in general, it avoids humans), and most of the more fertile districts now carry crops or exotic pasture grasses which kangaroos tend not to eat. (One of the easiest ways to find kangaroos is to look for patches of remnant native grassland.)References Category:Macropods Category:Mammals of Tasmania Category:Mammals of South Australia Category:Mammals of New South Wales Category:Mammals of Victoria (Australia) Category:Marsupials of Australia Category:Megafauna ca:Cangur gris oriental cs:Klokan obrovský de:Östliches Graues Riesenkänguru es:Macropus giganteus eo:Orienta griza kanguruo fr:Kangourou géant hr:Istočni sivi klokan it:Macropus giganteus la:Macropus giganteus lt:Didžioji pilkoji kengūra hu:Keleti szürke óriáskenguru nl:Grijze reuzenkangoeroe ja:オオカンガルー pl:Kangur olbrzymi sk:Kengura sivá sr:Источни сиви кенгур
