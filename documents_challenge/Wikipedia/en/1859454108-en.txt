In the 1995&ndash;96 season he was sent on loan at Vorwärts Steyr, and played his first top-level game away against Grazer AK. After a strong performance in goal, Grazer decided to sign him as backup goalkeeper in summer 1996. Manninger's first match was a baptism of fire; after first-choice goalkeeper Franz Almer fell ill before a UEFA Cup second round game against Internazionale in autumn 1996, Manninger found himself making his debut in the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. He put in a strong performance and pulled off several high-quality saves as GAK narrowly lost 1–0. In the return leg, GAK won 1–0 to level the aggregate score at 1–1, but lost in the resulting penalty shoot-out.ArsenalAfter that, he remained first-choice for the rest of the 1996–97 season and was signed by Arsenal in June 1997 as cover for David Seaman. During the 1997–98 season Seaman suffered a long spell out injured and Manninger ably covered for him, enjoying a spell of six clean sheets in a row in the league, a joint-club record with Jimmy Ashcroft. The last of these was against Manchester United at Old Trafford, where Arsenal won 1–0, a result which helped them beat United to the 1997–98 FA Premier League title, thereby winning the player of the month award, a first for an understudy goalkeeper in the Premier League. However, Manninger had to make way for Seaman once the Englishman returned from injury.Manninger continued to deputise for Seaman for the next three seasons, but without a consistent run in the side he was unable to maximise his potential. In all he made only 64 appearances over four seasons for Arsenal. After the Gunners bought Richard Wright in 2001, Manninger became number three at Arsenal, and spent the 2001-02 season on loan at Fiorentina, making 24 appearances.In July 2002 RCD Espanyol signed Manninger on a four-year deal for £960,000. However they released him just seven weeks later before he had made a first team appearance. Doubts were raised as to whether his transfer from Arsenal had been fully completed; although Manninger claimed Espanyol didn't have the money to pay his fee.Serie AManninger joined Torino in January 2003, staying there six months before joining Bologna in the summer. He spent two years with the club but unable to break into the first team he had a loan spell with Siena, before he rejoined Red Bull Salzburg (as they are now known) in 2005. For the 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons he returned on loan to Siena, where he was first-choice goalkeeper.At the end of the 2007-08 season he returned from his loan back to Red Bull Salzburg, but did not stay for long. In July 2008, Manninger moved back to Italy with Udinese, but stayed with the club for only a few weeks before signing for Juventus as backup for Gianluigi Buffon. He is the second goalkeeper purchased by the Turin club during summer 2008, along with Antonio Chimenti, also from Udinese.International careerManninger made his debut for Austria in an August 1999 friendly match against Sweden and was member of the Austrian Euro 2008 squad. He has so far (August 2008) earned 30 caps.HonoursEnglish Premier League (1):1998FA Cup (1):1998External linksPlayer profile - JuventusPlayer profile - EURO2008Career stats - National Football TeamsReferences  Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from Salzburg Category:Football (soccer) goalkeepers Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austria international footballers Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:FC Red Bull Salzburg players Category:Vorwärts Steyr players Category:Grazer AK players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:ACF Fiorentina players Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:Torino F.C. players Category:Bologna F.C. 1909 players Category:A.C.
