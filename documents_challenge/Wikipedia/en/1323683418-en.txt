Ángel was sold to River Plate, Argentina as a replacement of the departed Hernán Crespo. River Plate spectators would often adorn angel wings to show their appreciation.Aston VillaÁngel became Aston Villa's record signing at £9.5 million on 12 January 2001. In his time at Villa, he was reportedly Villa's highest earner. After an indifferent start to his Aston Villa career, and family difficulties, Angel settled down and started to produce the form that persuaded Doug Ellis to shell out the massive transfer fee. He quickly became a fans favourite and is the most recent Villa player to have scored more than 20 goals in one season, finishing as the club's top scorer in the 2003-04 season with 16 goals in the FA Premier League,http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/topscorers?league=ENG.1&amp;year=2003&amp;&amp;cc=5901 JPA ninth highest scorer in EPL (23 goals including cup competitions) but could not maintain that form as Villa struggled and he only managed seven goals in 2004-05.In the 2004-2005 season, Ángel missed 2 penalties in a game against Fulham. Edwin van der Sar saved both penalties and, then manager David O'leary said Angel's penalties days are over. He then went on a long drought on the goal mouth costing himself a place in the starting 11 with Milan Baros being preferred.His last season for Villa (2006-2007) was a mixed one for Ángel. After much initial promise in which Ángel scored seven goals, the arrival of John Carew and Ashley Young in the January Transfer window pushed Ángel further down the pecking order at Villa Park, as well as losing his place in the first team before their arrival after a disastrous 60 seconds against Tottenham Hotspur where he missed a penalty then scored an own goal.At Aston Villa, Angel still managed 74 goals in 205 games. Only one player has scored more for Villa since 1991, that being Dwight Yorke (97 goals in 288 games).New York Red BullsOn 17 April, 2007, the New York Red Bulls announced the signing of Ángel as their second designated player, pending the approval of his work visa. After his visa was approved, Ángel made his Red Bull debut 8 May 2007 in a U.S. Open Cup qualifying match. Ángel came on as a substitute and scored a free kick in extra time during the Red Bulls' 3-1 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy.Ángel scored his first MLS goal for New York on May 19, 2007, in a 4-0 win over the Columbus Crew. Ángel also recorded an assist and played an important role in a third goal to round off a performance that earned him that week's MLS Player of the Week award. His form showed no signs of letting up in the following game, as he weighed in with two goals and another assist as the Red Bulls overcame Chicago Fire to win 3-0, taking them to joint top of the Eastern Conference.Angel has been voted MLS Player of the Month for May. He is also the first Red Bull to score in six straight games.On August 18, 2007, Angel added two more goals to his tally. His team defeated Los Angeles Galaxy 5-4, in a match which David Beckham was playing for his opponents. Angel scored the first goal early on from a free kick before striking a late winner to seal the game for the Red Bulls. Angel also scored the first goal of the 2007 MLS All-Star Game on July 19 2007 against Celtic F.C., and later was named MVP of the Match for his performance.http://web.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20070720&amp;content_id=106956&amp;vkey=pr_rbn&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=t107 press release via RBNY site On 29th September 2007 Angel scored a penalty to tie the Red Bulls' game against Real Salt Lake and in doing so scored his 17th goal of the season in all competitions, setting a new franchise record. Angel concluded his initial campaign in New York scoring 19 goals and 5 assists in 24 league matches (20 goals in 27 matches in all official competitions). His regular season goal total was one short of Luciano Emilio who led the league with 20 but who had also played more games.Play-offsOn the 26th October 2007, Angel told the New York Daily News, "It's very American, in every sport the playoff system ... I think there should be more credit to the guys who do well in the regular season. It's interesting. It's a little bit unfair. I'm trying to understand it. I might answer you in a different way in a couple of weeks."Red Bulls star Juan Pablo Angel learning about A-Rod rule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;A week later, Angel and the Red Bulls were knocked out of contention for the 2007 MLS Cup by the New England Revolution on a 1-0 aggregate score as Angel pleaded to his manager to be brought back on after coming off for treatment to a head injury received during the match which turned out to be a concussion.New York Red Bulls (Second Season)Angel had a slow start to the 2008 season due to an arthritic nerve-related injury in his lower back that caused him to have pain in his hamstring but he finally scored his first of the season in his fourth appearance - a 2-1 winner against LA Galaxy on May 10th. On June 5th he fought through a still painful injury to score the only goal in New York's home win against Chivas USA. However, in doing so he also picked up a another slight hamstring strain and after the final whistle he was seen limping off the pitch. As a result of this injury Angel missed the Red bulls' next 4 consecutive league games. Even through this injury-plagued season, his three goals were enough for coach Steve Nicol to name him to the 2008 MLS All-Star Game vs West Ham United in which he fed the pass that earned the game winning penalty kick and also scored a goal that was disallowed due to a controversial offside.Career statisticshttp://www.level-k.com/player/J_Angel.htm   |- |1993||rowspan="5"|Atlético Nacional||||3||1|||||||||||||||| |- |1994||||32||8|||||||||||||||| |- |1995||||22||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1996|||||||||||||||||||||| |- |1997||||||||||||||||||||||  |- |1997-98||rowspan="4"|River Plate||rowspan="4"|Primera División||12||2|||||||||||||||| |- |1998-99||31||11|||||||||||||||| |- |1999-00||35||20|||||||||||||||| |- |2000-01||18||13||||||||||||||||  |- |2000-01||rowspan="7"|Aston Villa||rowspan="7"|Premier League||9||1|||||||||||||||| |- |2001-02||29||12||1||0||0||0||2||2||32||14 |- |2002-03||15||1||1||1||3||1||-||-||19||3 |- |2003-04||33||16||1||0||5||7||-||-||39||23 |- |2004-05||35||7||1||0||2||2||-||-||38||9 |- |2005-06||31||3||3||0||3||0||-||-||37||3 |- |2006-07||23||4||1||0||3||3||-||-||27||7  |- |2007||rowspan="2"|Red Bull New York||rowspan="2"|Major League Soccer||24||19||1||1||-||-||-||-||25||20 |- |2008||19||11||1||0||-||-||-||-||22||11 54||45|||||||||||||||| 96||46|||||||||||||||| 175||44||8||1||16||13||2||2||192||59 43||30||2||1||-||-||-||-||45||31 367||165||10||2||16||13||2||2|||| |TitlesSeasonTeamTitle1994Colombia Atlético NacionalColombian league]]1995Colombia Atlético NacionalCopa InteramericanaClausura 1998]]Argentina River PlatePrimera División ArgentinaApertura 1999]]Argentina River PlatePrimera División ArgentinaClausura 1999]]Argentina River PlatePrimera División ArgentinaSee alsoList of current MLS playersReferencesExternal linksArgentine League Statistics  Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Atlético Nacional footballers Category:Colombian footballers Category:Premier League players Category:Football (soccer) strikers Category:River Plate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina Category:Colombian Roman Catholics Category:Red Bull New York players Category:Colombia international footballersbg:Хуан Пабло Анхел ca:Juan Pablo Ángel Arango da:Juan Pablo Ángel de:Juan Pablo Ángel es:Juan Pablo Ángel fr:Juan Pablo Ángel it:Juan Pablo Ángel he:חואן פאבלו אנחל lt:Juan Pablo Ángel nl:Juan Pablo Ángel ja:ファン・パブロ・アンヘル no:Juan Pablo Ángel pl:Juan Pablo Ángel ru:Анхель, Хуан Пабло fi:Juan Pablo Ángel sv:Juan Pablo Ángel zh:胡安·巴勃罗·安赫尔
