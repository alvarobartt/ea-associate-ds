He was the son of Sultan Mahmud II and succeeded his brother Abdülmecid I in 1861.Born in İstanbul on February 9, 1830, Abdülaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was interested in literature and was also a classical music composer. Some of his compositions have been collected in the album "European Music at the Ottoman Court" by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music.FamilyHis parents were Mahmud II and Pertevniyal Valide Sultan (1812 - 1883) His profile in the Ottoman Web Site The name of his mother is also spelled as "Partav-Nihal".

[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire#Administrative reform, 1864|New administrative districts (vilayets) were set up in 1864]] and a Council of State was established in 1868. Public education was organized on the French model and the Istanbul University was reorganized as a modern institution in 1861.Abdülaziz cultivated good relations with the Second French Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and was the first Ottoman sultan to visit Western Europe, in 1867, which included a visit to England, where he was made a Knight of the Garter by Queen Victoria and shown a Royal Navy Fleet Review with his Khedive of Egypt. He travelled by a private rail car, which today can be found in the RMK Museum in İstanbul. His fellow Knights of the Garter created in 1867 were Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond, Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland, Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Franz Joseph I of Austria and Alexander II of Russia.In 1869, Abdülaziz received visits from Eugénie de Montijo, Empress consort of Napoleon III of France and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the Suez Canal. The Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom, twice visited İstanbul.By 1871 both Aali Pasha and Fuad Pasha were dead. The Second French Empire, his Western European model, had been defeated in the Franco-Prussian War by the North German Confederation under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia. In foreign policy, Abdülaziz turned to the Russian Empire for friendship, as turmoil in the Balkan provinces continued. In 1875, the Herzegovinian rebellion was the beginning of further unrest in the Balkan provinces. In 1876, the April Uprising saw insurrection spreading among the Bulgarians. Ill feeling mounted against Russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.The crop failure of 1873, the sultan's lavish expenditures for the Ottoman Navy and the new palaces which he built, and the mounting public debt had also heightened public discontent. Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on May 30, 1876; his death a few days later was attributed to suicide.AchievementsThe biggest achievement of Abdülaziz was to modernize the Ottoman Navy. In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 other types of warships, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies.He also established the first Ottoman railroad network and Sirkeci Train Station in İstanbul, terminus of the Orient Express.Impressed by the museums in London, Paris and Vienna, he established the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.Under Abdülaziz's reign, Turkey's first postage stamps were issued in 1863, and Turkey joined the Universal Postal Union in 1875 as a founding member.Issue]] Ten children survived him:i339.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Prince Yussuf Izzeddin Efendi (1857-1916)Princess Saliha, wife of Kürt Ismail Pasha (1862-1941)Prince Shehzade Mahmud Celaleddin Efendi (1862-1888)Princess Nazime, wife of Halit Pasha (1866-1947)Prince Abdülmecid II last Caliphe (1868-1944)Prince Mehmed Salâhaddin Efendi (1870-1900)Prince Şevket (1872&ndash;1899)Princess Esma Sultana (1873-1899)Prince Seyfeddin Efendi (1874-1927)Princess Emine, wife of Mehmet Bey (1874-1920)Princess Munire Sultana (1877-1877)Wifes: PARTNER 1 : HH Dürrünev Kadin Efendi MAR 1835 - 4 DEC 1892 Union: 1856, Dolma Bagce Palace,TurkeyHIH Prince Shehzade YUSUF IZZEDDIN Efendi OCT 1857 - 1 FEB 1916 HIH Princess Saliha Sultana AUG 1862 - 1941 HIH Princess Emine Sultana NOV 1866 - 23 JAN 1867PARTNER 2 : HH Edâdil Kadin Efendi - 12 DEC 1875 Union: 1861, Dolma Bagce Palace,TurkeyHIH Prince Shehzade MAHMUD CELALEDDIN Efendi NOV 1862 - 1 SEP 1888 HIH Prince Shehzade MEHMED SELIM Efendi SEP 1866 - 21 OCT 1867PARTNER 3 : HH Gevherin Kadin Efendi JUL 1856 - 20 SEP 1894 Union: 1872HIH Prince Shehzade MEHMED SEYFEDDIN Efendi SEP 1874 - 19 OCT 1927PARTNER 4 : HH Hayranidil Kadin Efendi NOV 1846 - 26 NOV 1898 Union: 21 SEP 1866, Dolma Bagce,TurkeyHIH Princess Nazima Sultana FEB 1866 - 1947 HM Caliph ABDUL MEJID II MAY 1868 - 23 AUG 1944PARTNER 5 : Nesherek Haseki Kadin Efendi - 11 JUN 1876 Union: 1868, Dolma Bagce,TurkeyHIH Prince Shehzade Mehmed Salâhaddin MAR 1870 - 29 Aug 1916PARTNER 6 : HH Nesrin Kadin Efendi - 29 SEP 1895HIH Prince Shehzade MUHAMMED SHEFKET Efendi JUN 1872 - 22 OCT 1899 HIH Princess Esma Sultana MAR 1873 - 7 MAY 1899 HIH Princess Emine Sultana AUG 1874 - 29 JAN 1920PARTNER 7 : YildizHIH Princess Fatma Sultana - 1875 HIH Princess Munire Sultana - 1877Referenceshttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Ne%C5%9Ferek_Haseki_kad%C4%B1n_Efendi.jpg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesherek_Haseki_Kadin_Efendi  External links References  External links           Category:1830 births Category:1876 deaths Category:People from Istanbul Category:Sultans of the Ottoman Empire Category:Turkic rulers Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Knights of the Golden Fleecear:عبد العزيز الأول bs:Abdul Aziz (sultan) bg:Абдул Азис ca:Abdülâziz de:Abd ul Aziz es:Abdülaziz I eo:Abd-ul-Aziz fr:Abdulaziz hr:Abdul Aziz id:Abdul Aziz it:Abdülaziz he:אבדילאזיז lv:Abdulazizs hu:Abdul-Aziz mk:Абдул Азис nl:Abdülaziz ja:アブデュルアズィズ no:Abdülâziz pl:Abd-ul-Aziz pt:Abd-ul-Aziz ru:Абдул-Азиз sr:Абдул Азиз sh:Abdul Aziz sv:Abd ül-Aziz tr:Abdülaziz ur:عبد العزیز zh:阿布杜勒阿齊茲
