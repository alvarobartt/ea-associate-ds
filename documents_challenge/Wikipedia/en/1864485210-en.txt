 | operating system = Microsoft Windows, Linux | genre = Digital photo organizer | license = Proprietary | website = http://picasa.google.com/  Picasa is a software application for organizing and editing digital photos, originally created by Idealab and now owned by Google. "Picasa" is a blend of the name of Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, the phrase mi casa for "my house," and "pic" for pictures (personalized art). In July 2004, Google acquired Picasa and began offering Picasa for free download. At the time of the acquisition, the company's management team consisted of Lars Perkins as CEO, Mike Herf as CTO, and Dan Engel as VP Market Development.Native applications for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Linux are available through Google Labs. For Windows 98 and Windows Me, only an older version is available. There is also an iPhoto plugin or a stand-alone program for uploading photos available for Mac OS X 10.4 and later.FeaturesOrganization and editingFor organizing photos, Picasa has file importing and tracking features, as well as tags and collections for further sorting. It also offers several basic photo editing functions, including color enhancement, red eye reduction and cropping. Other features include slide shows, printing and image timelines. Images can also be prepared for external use, such as for e-mailing or printing, by reducing file size and setting up page layouts. There is also integration with online photo printing services.KeywordsPicasa uses picasa.ini files to keep track of keywords for each image. In addition to this, Picasa attaches IPTC keyword data to JPEG files, but not to any other file format. Keywords attached to JPEG files in Picasa can be read by other image library software like Adobe (Photoshop, Album and Bridge), digiKam and iPhoto.According to the Picasa Readme, Picasa can parse XMP data. However, it cannot search local files for existing XMP keywords.SearchingPicasa has a search bar that is always visible when viewing the library. Searches are live in that displayed items are filtered as you type.When a word is typed into the search bar, an image will be displayed if that word is all or part of a keyword, or part of the file name. If the searched word is part of a folder name, all images in that folder are also displayed (but not necessarily images in subfolders, unless the word also exists in a keyword or filename.)Picasa also supports boolean operators for searching in much the same way as Google's web search. All search terms are included by default (as with the operator "AND"), and keywords may be omitted by using the hyphen (as in the boolean operator "NOT"). For example, the search "family -friends" will cause Picasa to display all images with the keyword family, but which do not include the keyword friends.ViewingPicasa has no separate view window. There is only an "edit view" with a viewing area. Fullscreen view is available in slideshow mode, by holding down the ctrl+alt keys while in "edit view", or by pressing the Alt Gr key.BackupPicasa does not overwrite photos when changes are made. Instead, it lists all the changes made and puts the list in a separate file. Whenever the image is opened in Picasa it will check the list and apply the changes that the list tells it to. If you open the photo in any other program, though, the image will not have the changes applied to it. To see the changes when using the photo in other programs you must 'export' the photo. In Picasa 2, a new feature has been added to allow users to save changes made to the pictures in Picasa by overwriting the actual picture file. However, a backup version of the original picture is made and saved in a hidden folder named "Originals", which is located within the same folder as the original picture.Image recognitionOn 15 August, 2006, Google announced they had acquired Neven Vision whose technology can be used to search for features within photos such as people or buildings. Google has stated that this technology will be applied to searching for photos within Picasa at some stage in the near future.Neven Vision incorporates several patents specifically centered around face recognition from digital photo and video images. Neven Vision's technology has been voted among the top finishers in both the FERET 1997 and FRVT 2002 independent tests comparing the world's best face recognition technologies.Other Picasa applicationsPicasa Web AlbumsPicasa Web Albums (PWA) is a photo-sharing web application from Google, often compared to programs like Flickr and Zooomr.It allows users with accounts at Google to store and share 1 GB of photos for free. Users can purchase more storage space, which is shared between other Google services, to a total of:Plans: no. of GigabytesCost per Year in US$Cost of 1GB per Year in US$10202.0040751.8751502501.6674005001.25Users may upload pictures either via a web interface, Picasa 2.5.0 or later,Picasa Web Albums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; on Microsoft Windows, using the Exporter for iPhoto, the Aperture to Picasa Web Albums plug-in, or Uploader on Mac OS X,Picasa Web Albums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; or F-Spot on Linux. In both paid and free accounts, the actual resolution of the photo is maintained (even though a smaller resolution photo may be displayed by the web interface), and the original photo can be downloaded.PWA uses an "unlisted number" approach for URLs for private photo albums. This allows a user to email a private album's URL to anyone s/he wants; the recipient can view the album without having to create a user account - this is done via an "authentication key" that's needed to be appended to the URL for the album to be shown. The Picasa help files say that private albums are not searchable by anyone except the user.On October 11, 2006, the "Test" name was removed, in favour of purely Picasa Web Albums.No ads are shown on Picasa Web Albums, in either free or paid accounts.
