A poor family, both parents were forced to work, often leaving the young Marie alone. It was during this time alone that she developed an interest in performing, standing in front of a mirror pretending to be a star. Together with her siblings, or neighbourhood children Marie began to play music and sing. She was often asked by her mother to perform in front of friends who were impressed by her Olivia Newton-John-like singing voice.Roxette The Book by Larz Lundgren, pg 32Her interest grew stronger in her teens as she discovered artists such as Joni Mitchell, The Beatles and Deep Purple. At 17, Marie enrolled in a music college and performed in local theatre.Roxette The Book by Larz Lundgren, pg 51 However she found it incredibly boring, instead longing for the thrill of an audience. As she put it - "I wanted to perform. I'm a performer."The Making of Joyride Documentary 1991 She became involved in theatre, and after moving to the town of Halmstad, she found herself involved in the local music scene. Joining her boyfriend's Stefans band Strul, they played local gigs and even recorded a single. After that group split, Marie and new boyfriend Martin Sternhuvsvud reformed as MaMas Barn. They recorded one album together. Per Gessle, lead singer of the famous Swedish group Gyllene Tider, shared a rehearsal studio with Marie and they became friends. Per believed Marie was far too talented to be hiding behind keyboards in local pub bands, and got her an audition with his producer, Lasse Lindbom who was extremely well known in Sweden. Lasse was suitably impressed with her voice, and offered her a contract.Roxette The Book by Larz Lundgren, pg 134 Marie's family was not supportive, with the exception of her sisters Ulla-Britt and Tina. Marie's mother felt that Marie needed to get an education and a serious job, and that music would only lead to drugs and failure. With her sisters and Per's support, Marie decided to sign with Lasse and did some work as a backing vocalist.Going Solo: ''Het vind'' and ''[[Den sjunde vågen]]''Lasse Lindbom asked Marie to record a duet with him, "Så nära nu," which lead to her joining his group "The Lasse Lindbom Band." Per Gessle started to encourage her to start a solo career, but Marie was too nervous and lacked confidence. Fredriksson finally accepted, and she recorded her first solo album, Het vind, produced by Lindbom."Ännu doftar kärlek" was the first single, which was a big radio hit. The album received mixed reviews. One newspaper wrote "Is this the best you can do Marie?" Marie was crushed, saying the review felt like a "knife in the heart." She went on tour with the Lasse Lindbom Band, as she didn't have enough self-confidence to tour on her own. Lasse, Marie, Per Gessle and Mats "MP" Persson started a new band called "Spännande Ostar" ("Exciting Cheeses"), which toured for a short time in some clubs. That same year, Marie and Lasse went to the Canary Islands to write songs for Marie's second solo album. They returned to Sweden for the recording.The album was released in 1986, under the name "Den Sjunde Vågen". "Den bästa dagen" and "Silver i din hand" were released as singles, and the album was a huge success, and Marie finally found the courage to tour as a solo artist.Start of ''[[Roxette]]'' and ''[[Efter stormen]]''For many years Per and Marie had talked about working together. Marie had done backing vocal work for Per's band Gyllene Tider, and they had worked together on Spännande Ostar and other projects, including an attempt by Gyllene Tider to release an English language album in America. Marie's career was soaring in Sweden, but Per - a former boyband member whose solo career was not doing well - was not as successful. Friends and people in the industry warned her against working with Per. His idea was to form a duo, singing in English, and try to have some success in Europe. At that time, it was not popular for Swedish artists to perform in English. It was seen as selling out, and a very risky move for an up and coming artist such as Marie. She took the risk - and it paid off.In 1986, she teamed up with Per under the name Roxette - the name Gyllene Tider had used when they tried to release their album "The Heartland Cafe" in the US. Their first single "Neverending Love" was a hit in Sweden, and Roxette's album "Pearls of Passion" breathed new life into Per's flagging career, and cemented Marie as a major artist.Marie didn't want to let down her Swedish fans, and so after the tour "Rock Runt Riket" with Roxette, it was time for her to record a new solo album. Once again, she worked together with Lasse Lindbom, both as a producer and as a songwriter. The new album went ahead and was recorded over two sessions, one in May and the other in September of 1987.Efter Stormen, her third solo album, was even bigger than the previous two. It was followed by another solo tour, but this time the songs were performed in more acoustic way than before, creating a whole new atmosphere. At that time Marie Fredriksson believed the music should speak for itself, and fancy stage accessories were not important.In February 1989, she also recorded a song for a TV Series called Sparvöga. Her song, the title theme of the show, became one of her most beloved and best known songs. Marie was now one of the most well known singers in Sweden.Roxette Hit It BigIn 1989 Roxette went back to the studio and recorded a second album, Look Sharp which once again returned them to the charts in Sweden. However in 1989, Roxette had an unexpected hit in the USA with "The Look". Almost overnight Fredriksson and Gessle were catapulted from being minor celebrities in Sweden to major artists internationally and suddenly found themselves traveling all over the world, selling millions, and receiving awards. Look Sharp! was a massive hit, producing two US number one hits.In 1990 Per was approached by Touchstone pictures to write a song for the upcoming film Pretty Woman. Not having time for a new song, Per reedited an old Christmas song and gave them "It Must Have Been Love." The song was included on the movie, reached number one in America and became one of Roxette's most well known songs.In 1991 Joyride was released, giving them another number one hit. They followed it up with the huge Join the Joyride world tour in over 100 cities during 1991 and 92.''[[Den ständiga resan]]'' (The Eternal Journey)In 1992 Fredriksson returned to her solo career, recording the soul searching "Den ständiga resan."Den ständiga resan was her musical self-portrait and was written like a diary, containing very personal songs about her life, feelings and relationships. The extremely personal album reflected the difficult period in Marie's life. "It mirrors a four to five year period of my life," said Marie about the album. "It was a crisis, with hellish side effects. But I'm glad I went through it."Den Ständiga Resan documentary, directed by Jonas Åkerlund The song "Ett enda liv" was written about a good friend of hers who committed suicide. Marie's mother did not approve of the album, asking Marie why she shared such personal feelings in public. The album is favourite with fans who enjoyed such a personal look at their idol.During Roxette's worldwide Joyride tour, Fredriksson met a friend of the band, Mikael Bolyos in Australia. They were engaged within 3 days and Fredriksson was pregnant within a year. During her pregnancy, she did a small tour around Sweden to support the Den ständiga Resan album, and also a performance with Roxette for MTV Unplugged. She gave birth to their daughter Inez Josefin (known as Josefin) on April 29 1993.''[[I en tid som vår]]'' (In a Time Like Ours)In 1996 Fredriksson recorded a ballads album in Spanish with Roxette and a new solo album "I en tid som vår" Her second child, Oscar Mikael was born.''[[Äntligen]] (Finally) - Marie Fredrikssons bästa 1984–2000''In 1998 and 1999, Fredriksson worked with Gessle on the new Roxette album Have A Nice Day. In 2000 Fredriksson released a greatest hits album under the title Äntligen - Marie Fredrikssons bästa 1984–2000. It was followed by a very popular summer tourAftonbladet nöje: Äntligen är Marie på väg igen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;, later released as a live CD/DVD package called Äntligen - Sommarturné. The album to date has sold more than 350,000 - two more singles were released from the album, "Äntligen" and "Det som var nu".Fredriksson released all her albums in a box set, called Kärlekens Guld (Love's Gold). The remastered albums feature previously unreleased songs as well as new packaging.CancerOn September 11, 2002 Marie suffered a terrible accident. She fainted in her bathroom, severely hitting her head and receiving a concussion. Scans would show even worse news - Marie had a brain tumor in the back of her head.Marie har en hjärntumör | Nöjesliv | Aftonbladet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; After waiting several weeks for the concussion to subside, she underwent a successful surgery to remove the tumour. It was malignant and she then endured months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. She was given only about a 50% chance of survival, but managed to pull through. She received some permanent damage to her brain, losing the ability to read and count, the vision in her right eye, and some loss of movement in her right side.Cancern slog ut synen | Nöjesliv | Aftonbladet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;In January 2003 Roxette were awarded the 'Royal Medal with Blue Ribbon' by King of Sweden Carl Gustaf XVI. The ceremony was the first event at which Fredriksson appeared after her operation. She appeared thin, but in good health and spirits. This was one of very few public appearances which Marie made during her illness. She withdrew from the public eye for almost two years.On October 21st, 2005 Marie states, "It’s been three very difficult years,” but in an interview with Jens Peterson published today in Aftonbladet, Fredriksson says she has won her fight against cancer. “I’m healthy,” she says. “I’m not receiving treatment anymore.”However, similarly to the refusal of some people to believe that Jim Morrison is dead, some people refuse to believe that Marie had a brain tumor. This is because they interpret it to say that the fainting spell caused her brain tumor, which is medically impossible. Marie has yet to know about this suspicion.Roxette fick pris av kungen | Musik | Nöjesliv | Aftonbladet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;''[[The Change (Marie Fredriksson album)|The Change]]''[[Image:The Change - Front1.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of The Change, 2004]]About 6 months after Fredriksson's cancer diagnosis, she and her husband Micke began to work on her first ever English solo album. She called the album The Change.The album was well received by the Swedish public and entered the Swedish chart at No. 1 The first single, "2:nd Chance", entered the Swedish singles chart at number 1. November 26 2004, a year after the release, The Change achieved gold status (20,000 copies sold) in Sweden, according to IFPI.In conjunction with the release of The Change, Marie Fredriksson started a new publishing company together with her husband Micke Bolyos. MaryJane Music was mainly created "as a home for Marie's solo albums," states the label's website, "but as the musical collaboration between Marie and Mikael continues and expands, don't be surprised if you find other exciting projects with some of their musical friends released on this label."''[[Min bäste vän]]'' (My Best Friend) In 2006 Fredriksson returned with a new CD of Swedish cover songs called Min bäste vän (My Best Friend) in February. The first single released from this cover album was the song "Sommaräng" by Swedish artist John Holm. "Ingen kommer undan politiken" was the second single outtake off the album later that year (but only as a promotional CD).During her illness Fredriksson rediscovered her love of drawing. Although she could no longer read or write, drawing was one thing she could still do and she found a real passion for it. She had always been very private about her artwork but for the first time she exhibited a collection of her drawings in a gallery show entitled "After The Change". The vernissage at the Doktor Glas gallery in Kungsträdgården featured 24 of her charcoal drawings and ran from 21–30 October. Later she released the book "After The Change", featuring reprints of all 24 sketches.Marie Fredriksson's Life TodayFredriksson continues to work as a musical artist and as a painter. She's talked about a new art exhibition in the near future and possibly a new album either with Roxette or as a solo artist. Six years on, she has not fully recovered from the brain damage her cancer caused and it seems unlikely she will return to her former stressful life of albums, interviews and tours. Apart from the occasional interview, appearance or performance, Marie shies away from the public eye. In the meantime she enjoys her days drawing, making music with her husband and friends, and most importantly spending valuable time with her children Oscar and Josefin.Marie recently celebrated her 50th birthday, a milestone made even more meaningful after her battle with cancer. She celebrated in London with family and friends, and said she was thrilled to reach 50.&quot;A Family Affair&quot;Marie's husband, Mikael Bolyos, recorded an album titled A Family Affair. The CD included a couple of surprises: four songs sung by Marie Fredriksson including the legendary song "Hometown" which has only been heard partly in a Swedish film back in 1996 and was highly sought after by fans. Many of the other songs on the album feature the vocals of Marie also. Marie sings lead on "In The Corner Of Your Eye", "Tell It To My Heart", "Outro" and "Hometown", as well as backing vocals on "Me & My Guitar" and "Lilly".DiscographyAlbumsHet vind (1984) SW#20Den sjunde vågen (1985) SW#6Efter stormen (1987) SW#1Den ständiga resan (1992) SW#1 NO#17I en tid som vår (1996) SW#2Äntligen - Marie Fredrikssons bästa 1984-2000 (2000) SW#1 NO#6Kärlekens Guld (6-CD Box) (2002)The Change (2004) SW#1Min bäste vän (2006) SW#3"A Family Affair" feat Marie Fredriksson (2007)Tid för tystnad - Marie Fredrikssons ballader (2007) SW#32 AR#16Singles"Ännu doftar kärlek" (1984) SW#18"Het vind" (1984)"Den bästa dagen" (1985)"Silver i din hand" (1986)"Efter stormen" (1987) SW#7"Sparvöga" (1989) SW#6"Så länge det lyser mittemot" (1992)"Mellan sommar och höst" (1992)"Tro" (1996) SW#8"I en tid som vår" (1996)"Ber bara en gång" (1997)"Äntligen" (2000) SW#34"Det som var nu" (2000) SW#59"2nd Chance" (2004) SW#8"All About You" (2004)"A Table In The Sun" (2005)"Sommaräng" (2006) SW#21"Ingen kommer undan politiken" (2006)"Ordet är farväl" (2007)"Där du andas" (2008) SW#1ReferencesRoxette: The Book by Larz Lundgren 1992The Look for Roxette by Robert Thoreliushttp://www.aftonbladet.sehttp://www.mariefredriksson.comhttp://www.worshipmarie.comSee alsoList of Swedes in musicExternal linksMarie Fredriksson (official website)Mary Jane MusicMarieFredriksson.netMarieFredriksson.euMarie Fredriksson Worship PageMarie Fredriksson (fan website)Marie Frederiksson on Europopmusic.eu (English) Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Cancer survivors Category:Swedish female singers Category:Swedish pop pianists Category:Swedish pop guitarists Category:Swedish pop singers Category:Swedish songwriters Category:English-language singers Category:Swedish-language singers Category:Spanish-language singersde:Marie Fredriksson es:Gun-Marie Fredriksson fr:Marie Fredriksson it:Marie Fredriksson he:מארי פרדריקסון nl:Marie Fredriksson no:Marie Fredriksson pl:Gun-Marie Fredriksson pt:Marie Fredriksson ru:Фредрикссон, Гун-Мари fi:Marie Fredriksson sv:Marie Fredriksson
