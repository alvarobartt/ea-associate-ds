 .]]Medea (, Mēdeia) in Greek mythology was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun Helios, and later wife to Jason. In Euripides' play Medea, Jason leaves Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers him his daughter, Creusa or Glauce. The play tells the story of the jealousy and revenge of a woman betrayed by her husband.The myths involving Jason also invoke Medea. These have been interpreted by specialists, principally in the past, as part of a class of myths that tell how the Hellenes of the distant heroic age, before the Trojan War, faced the challenges of the pre-Greek "Pelasgian" cultures of mainland Greece, and the Aegean and Anatolia. Jason, Perseus, Theseus, and above all Heracles, are all "liminal" figures, poised on the threshold between the old world of shamans, chthonic earth deities, and the new Bronze Age Greek ways.Medea figures in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, a myth known best from a late literary version worked up by Apollonius of Rhodes in the 3rd century B.C. and called the Argonautica. But for all its self-consciousness and researched archaic vocabulary, the late epic was based on very old, scattered materials. Medea is known in most stories as an enchantress and is often depicted as being a priestess of Hecate or a witch. The myth of Jason and Medea is very old, originally written around the time Hesiod wrote the Theogony. It was discussed briefly in the work Little Illiad from the 6th century B.C.==Jason and Medea==[[Image:Medea-Sandys.jpg|thumb|left|230px|'Medea': Painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys (1868)]] Medea's role began after Jason arrived from Iolcus to Colchis to claim his inheritance the Golden Fleece as his own. Medea fell in love with him and promised to help him, but only on the condition that if he succeeded, he would take her with him and marry her. Jason agreed. In a familiar mythic motif, Aeëtes promised to give him the fleece, but only if he could perform certain tasks. First, Jason had to plough a field with fire-breathing oxen that he had to yoke himself. Then, Jason had to sow the teeth of a dragon in the ploughed field (compare the myth of Cadmus). The teeth sprouted into an army of warriors. Jason was forewarned by Medea, however, and knew to throw a rock into the crowd. Unable to determine where the rock had come from, the soldiers attacked and defeated each other. Finally, Aeëtes made Jason fight and kill the sleepless dragon that guarded the fleece. Medea put the beast to sleep with her narcotic herbs. Jason then took the fleece and sailed away with Medea, as he had promised. (Some accounts say that Medea only helped Jason in the first place because Hera had convinced Aphrodite or Eros to cause Medea to fall in love with him.) Medea distracted her father as they fled by killing her brother Absyrtus. In some versions, Medea is said to have dismembered his body and scattered his parts on an island, knowing her father would stop to retrieve them for proper burial; in other versions, it is Absyrtus himself who pursued them, and was killed by Jason. During the flight, Atalanta was seriously wounded, but Medea healed her.According to some versions, Medea and Jason stopped on her aunt Circe's island so that they could be cleansed after the murder of her brother, relieving her of blame for the deed.(1865).]] On the way back to Thessaly, Medea prophesied that Euphemus, the Argo's helmsman, would one day rule over all Libya. This came true through Battus, a descendant of Euphemus.The Argo then reached the island of Crete, guarded by the bronze man, Talos (Talus). Talos had one vein which went from his neck to his ankle, bound shut by a single bronze nail. According to Apollodorus, Talos was slain either when Medea drove him mad with drugs, deceived him that she would make him immortal by removing the nail, or was killed by Poeas's arrow (Apollodorus 1.140). In the Argonautica, Medea hypnotized him from the Argo, driving him mad so that he dislodged the nail and died (Argonautica 4.1638). In any case, when the nail was removed, Talos's ichor flowed out, exsanguinating and killing him. After his death, the Argo landed.While Jason searched for the Golden Fleece, Hera, who was still angry at Pelias, conspired to make him fall in love with Medea, who she hoped would kill Pelias. When Jason and Medea returned to Iolcus, Pelias still refused to give up his throne. Medea conspired to have Pelias' own daughters kill him. She told them she could turn an old ram into a young ram by cutting up the old ram and boiling it (alternatively, she did this with Aeson, Jason's father). During the demonstration, a live, young ram jumped out of the pot. Excited, the girls cut their father into pieces and threw them into a pot. Having killed Pelias, Jason and Medea fled to Corinth.Many endingsIn Corinth, Jason left Medea for the king's daughter, Glauce. Medea took her revenge by sending Glauce a dress and golden coronet, covered in poison. This resulted in the deaths of both the princess and the king, Creon, when he went to save her. Then Medea stabbed to death the two sons she bore Jason. Afterward, she left Corinth and flew to Athens in a golden chariot driven by dragons sent by her grandfather Helios, god of the sun.(1862).]]The tragic situation of Medea, abandoned in Corinth by Jason, was the subject matter transformed by Euripides in his tragedy Medea, first performed in 431 BCE. In this telling, Medea resorted to filicide before her flight to Athens. Euripides was revolutionary in his retelling of Medea's myth because he was the first one to show that she hadn't killed her children because she was mad or a barbarian, but because she was extremely distressed and furious at Jason for leaving her to marry a princess. Fueled by a need for revenge, she sent Glauce a poisoned dress and crown that burned her to death. Creon found her corpse and clutched it in mourning, crying, "Let me die as well." The dress was poisoned so as to kill anyone who touched the girl. It killed him as well. After some hesitation and self-debate, Medea then killed her two sons, Mermeros and Pheres, to hurt Jason.Fleeing from Jason, Medea made her way to Athens where she healed Heracles (the former Argonaut) for the murder of Iphitus. In return, Heracles gave her a place to stay in Thebes until the Thebans drove her out in anger, despite Heracles' protests.She then fled to Athens where she met and married Aegeus. They had one son, Medus, although Hesiod makes Medus the son of JasonHesiod Theogony 1000-2. Her domestic bliss was once again shattered by the arrival of Aegeus' long-lost son, Theseus. Determined to preserve her own son's inheritance, Medea convinced her husband that Theseus was a threat and that he should be disposed of. As Medea handed Theseus a cup of poison, Aegeus recognized the young man's sword as his own, which he had left behind many years previous for his newborn son, to be given to him when he came of age. Knocking the cup from Medea's hand, Aegeus embraced Theseus as his own.Medea then returned to Colchis and, finding that Aeëtes had been deposed by his brother, promptly killed her uncle, and restored the kingdom to her father. Herodotus reports another version, in which Medea and her son Medus fled from Athens to the Iranian plateau and lived among the Aryans, who then changed their name to the Medes.Herodotus Histories VII.62iConfusion sometimes occurs among readers of Greek mythology over whether there were two Medeas and/or what order events in her story occur. Supposedly Medea lived her whole life in Colchis until the Argonauts arrived and she fled to Greece with them. Yet Theseus (who is often listed among the Argonauts) supposedly drove Medea out of Thebes during his first heroic quest. Medea could not have been in Thebes until after the Quest for the Golden Fleece, yet, if Theseus was an Argonaut, the Quest could not have occurred until after Theseus drove Medea out of Thebes. This could be considered a continuity error which might naturally arise from dozens or hundreds of different poets telling different stories using the same characters, or it could be explained away as there being two different witches named Medea. Furthermore, Theseus is not listed as an Argonaut in some versions of the story.Music(1907)]]Francesco Cavalli Giasone (opera, 1649)Antonio Caldara "Medea in Corinto" (cantata for alto, 2 violins and basso continuo, 1711) An excerpt can be listened to at http://www.earlymusic.net/jaycarter/audiovideo.htmMarc-Antoine Charpentier Médée (tragédie en musique,1693)Georg Anton Benda composed the melodrama Medea in 1775 on a text by Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter.Luigi Cherubini composed the opera Médée in 1797 and it is Cherubini's best-known work, but better known by its Italian title, Medea.Saverio Mercadante composed his opera Medea in 1851 to a libretto by Salvatore Cammarano.Darius Milhaud composed the opera Médée in 1939 to a text by Madeleine Milhaud (his wife and cousin).American composer Samuel Barber wrote his Medea ballet (later re-named The Cave of the Heart) in 1947 for Martha Graham and derived from that Medea's Meditation &amp; Dance of Vengeance Op. 23a in 1955.
