 Adagio is a French symphonic progressive metal band. Stephan Forté, the band's guitarist, is considered the creative force behind Adagio. Adagio's music is characterized by technical precision, dark, dense orchestration, complex lead work, and a driving rhythm section. However, on the group's third studio album, Dominate, they added death grunts to their sound. The band has finished the pre-production and mastering of their fourth album, Archangels in Black. The album will feature nine songs plus one Japanese bonus track. According to the band's website the "compositions are the ultimate between melodic and extreme metal, and can be considered as a more brutal version of Underworld." The new album is due to be released in January 2009.Line-upCurrent membersVocals: Christian PalinGuitar: Stephan FortéBass: Franck HermannyKeyboards: Kevin CodfertDrums: Eric LébaillyFormer membersVocals: Gus Monsanto (recorded Dominate.
