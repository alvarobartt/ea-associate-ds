 DorlandsSuf  = 12439692 |  The pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and rests in a small, bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae). The pituitary fossa, in which the pituitary gland sits, is situated in the sphenoid bone in the middle cranial fossa at the base of the brain.The pituitary gland secretes hormones regulating homeostasis, including tropic hormones that stimulate other endocrine glands. It is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence.SectionsLocated at the base of the brain, the pituitary is functionally linked to the hypothalamus. It is composed of two lobes: the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis. The adenohypophysis, also referred to as the anterior pituitary is divided into anatomical regions known as the pars tuberalis, pars intermedia, and pars distalis. The neurohypophysis, also referred to as the posterior pituitary. The pituitary is functionally linked to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk, whereby hypothalamic releasing factors are released and in turn stimulate the release of pituitary hormones.Anterior pituitary (Adenohypophysis)The anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes important endocrine hormones, such as ACTH, TSH, PRL, GH, endorphins, FSH, and LH. These hormones are released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of hypothalamus. Hypothalamic hormones are secreted to the anterior lobe by way of a special capillary system, called the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system.it is developed from dorsalwall of pharynx(stomodial part) i.e called as 'ruthke's pouch'. they all transport by special nerve cells present in the hypothalamus.such nerve cells are located in various parts of hypothalamus & send their nerve fibre into median eminence & tubar cinerium(b/w ant. &post. lobe).Posterior pituitary (Neurohypophysis)The hormones secreted by the posterior pituitary areOxytocin, where the majority is released from the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamusAntidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin and AVP, arginine vasopressin), the majority of which is released from the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamusOxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a positive feedback loop. For example, uterine contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary, which in turn increases uterine contractions. This positive feedback loop continues until the baby is born.Intermediate lobeThere is also an intermediate lobe in many animals. For instance in fish it is believed to control physiological colour change. In adult humans it is just a thin layer of cells between the anterior and posterior pituitary. The intermediate lobe produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), although this function is often (imprecisely) attributed to the anterior pituitary.FunctionsThe pituitary hormones help control some of the following body processes:GrowthBlood pressureSome aspects of pregnancy and childbirth including stimulation of uterine contractions during childbirthBreast milk productionSex organ functions in both women and menThyroid gland functionThe conversion of food into energy (metabolism)Water and osmolarity regulation in the body==Pathology== Disorders involving the pituitary gland include:ConditionDirectionHormoneAdditional imagesImage:Pituitary gland.png|Location of the pituitary gland in the human brain Image:Illu pituitary pineal glands.jpg|Pituitary and pineal glands Image:Gray516.png|The arteries of the base of the brain.
