Brachypelma is a genus of the family Theraphosidae containing various species of tarantulas.CharacteristicsThe species are native to parts of Central America. Habitat destruction and pet-trade collection has led these spiders to be among the few arthropods protected under the international CITES laws (Convention of trade in endangered species). They are docile tarantulas whose individuals are easy to keep in a terrarium. The most famous species in this genus are the Mexican redknee tarantula B. smithi, curlyhair B. albopilosum, Mexican fireleg B. boehmei, and the Mexican redrump B. vagans. They feed on almost anything smaller than themselves, so while insects and mice are the norm, they may also eat anoles, frogs, and even live minnows if they are offered. These species, like most tarantulas when held in captivity, often become cannibalistic, so individuals must be kept singly, though brief captive introductions of a mate for breeding purposes rarely result in a dead spider, so long as they are separated once they have finished.B. verdezi was previously misidentified as non-valid B.pallidum.Life cycleThese spiders are exceptionally slow growers and have impressive life spans of around 20 years for females. After hatching from a clutch that may vary from 100 to 600 eggs, the spiderlings will molt every two weeks for the first few months, then less and less frequently as they mature. A full-grown Brachypelma may molt as infrequently as once a year. These tarantulas reach sexual maturity at the age of around five years.Large spiders used in Hollywood movies (e.g. Indiana Jones, The Mummy Returns) are often Brachypelma smithi or Brachypelma emilia because they are very docile, though the much less expensive and only moderately more aggressive Chilean rose tarantula is frequently used as well. While it is almost unheard of for a Brachypelma to bite a human, they are quick to kick urticating hairs in self-defense, though their hairs are reportedly less irritating than those of other species, especially the goliath birdeater.SpeciesBrachypelma albiceps (Pocock) 1903 (S.W./Central Mexico) Junior synonym of B. ruhnaui - suspendedBrachypelma albopilosum Valerio, 1980 (N.
