Marne-la-Vallée - Chessy is a station of the RER system in the Île-de-France region of France, about 30 kilometres east of Paris. The station is located inside the Disneyland Resort Paris, just in front of the entrances to the two theme parks and to the Disney Village. A few years after its opening, it became bigger and more important with the addition of the TGV (high speed train) station which some Eurostar services also started to serve. !Previous!!!!Line!!!!Next    See alsoList of stations of the Paris MétroList of stations of the Paris RERCategory:Paris RER Marne-la-Vallée - Chessyde:Bahnhof Marne la Vallée-Chessy es:Estación de Marne la Vallée-Chessy fr:Gare de Marne-la-Vallée - Chessy id:Gare de Marne-la-Vallée - Chessy nl:Station Marne la Vallée-Chessy ja:マルヌ＝ラ＝ヴァレ＝シェシー駅 pl:Marne-la-Vallée - Chessy
