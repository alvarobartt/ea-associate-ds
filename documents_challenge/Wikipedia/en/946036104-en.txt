Its surface is one of the most reflective (at visual wavelengths) in the solar system, with a visual geometric albedo of 1.34. This very high albedo is the result of the sandblasting of particles from Saturn's E-ring, a faint ring composed of small, water-ice particle generated by Enceladus' south polar geysers.Not to be confused with asteroid 53 Kalypso.ReferencesExternal linksCalypso Profile by NASA's Solar System ExplorationThe Planetary Society: CalypsoCategory:Saturn's moonsbg:Калипсо (спътник) ca:Calipso (satèl·lit) cs:Calypso (měsíc) cy:Calypso (lloeren) da:Calypso (måne) de:Calypso (Mond) el:Καλυψώ (δορυφόρος) es:Calipso (luna) fr:Calypso (lune) hr:Kalipso (mjesec) it:Calipso (astronomia) la:Calypso (satelles) lt:Kalipsė (palydovas) nl:Calypso (maan) ja:カリプソ (衛星) nn:Saturnmånen Calypso pl:Kalipso (księżyc) ro:Calypso (satelit) ru:Калипсо (спутник) simple:Calypso (moon) sk:Calypso (mesiac) sl:Kalipso (luna) fi:Calypso (kuu) sv:Calypso (måne) uk:Каліпсо (супутник) zh:土卫十四
