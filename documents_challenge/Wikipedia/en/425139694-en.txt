  Chahārmahāl o Bakhtiyārī () is one of the 30 provinces of Iran. It lies in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital is Shahrekord.It has an area of 16,332 square kilometers and a population of 842,000 (2005 estimate).People and cultureThe history of the province is tied to that of the Bakhtiari tribe. The Bakhtiari tribe can be divided into two sub-tribes, Haft Lang and Chahar Lang with various territorial affiliations. As the name of the province dictates with the combining grammatical feature of "-o-" which is Persian for "and"; the other group of peoples in this ancient province are the Chahar Mahali's. These peoples and the Lur's live side by side and share almost similar customs. Very slight differences exist between them but most are almost unnoticeable. However there is often quite a bit of intermixing of the peoples through marriage. The cities of Broujen, Ben, Naafch and Saman fall in the Chahar Mahali area of the province and are generally not inhavited by Lurs. The Bakhtiari territories at times have also come under Isfahan and Khuzestan province.The people of this province have a history of having a simple living and being a capable people who are determined and effective warriors and fighters whenever circumstances made it necessary. They have gained such a reputation as being excellent, if not the best, horsemen in Iran. The people of this province, while having the more common Pahlevani wrestling/combat style of the deep rooted traditional Zurkhane, which exists everywhere in all provinces, also have their own style of wrestling/unarmed combat as well (as do other provinces). The style is called Jangi (Jang means War and hence Jangi "war'ish" or "war like").The province has various unique traditions and rituals relative to the 'tribal' lifestyles. Special forms of music, dance, and clothing are noteworthy.Administrative divisions===Counties (Shahrestans)===MapShahrestan(≈County)Bakhsh(≈District)District CenterArdalCentralArdalMiankoohSarkhunBoroojenCentralBoroojenBoldajiBoldajiGandomanGandomanFarsan]]CentralFarsanKoohrangCentralChelgerdBazaftChaman-GoliLordeganCentralLordeganFalardMal-e KhalifehKhanmirzaAluniManjManjShahr-e KordCentralShahr-e KordBenBenKiarShalamzarLaranSoureshjanSamanSaman===Cities and towns=== [[Image:Zamankhan bridge.JPG|thumb|right|The Zaman-khan bridge (built in the Safavid era) is one of 195 registered landmarks of cultural and historical value in the province.]]ShahrekordShahrekianHafshejanBorujenLordeganFarsanArdalFarrokhshahrNaafchSamanJuneghanBenGandomanBoldajiFaradonbehEconomyThe province is mainly active in the agriculture sector.
