The plant genus Tillandsia, a member of the Bromeliad family (Bromeliaceae), is found in the deserts, forests and mountains of Central and South America, and Mexico and the southern United States in North America. The thinner leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Moisture and nutrients are gathered from the air (dust, decaying leaves and insect matter) through structures on the leaves called trichomes. Tillandsia species are epiphytes, i.e. in nature they normally grow without soil, attached to other plants. Epiphytes are not parasitic, and depend on the host only for support. Common names for Tillandsia include air plant, ball moss (T. recurvata) and Spanish moss, the latter referring to T. usneoides in particular.The genus Tillandsia was named by Carolus Linnaeus after the Finnish physician and botanist Dr. Elias Tillandz (originally Tillander) (1640-1693).DescriptionTillandsia are epiphytes and need no soil because water and nutrients are absorbed through the leaves. The roots are used as anchors only. Reproduction is by seeds or by offsets called "pups". A single plant could have up to a dozen pups.[[Image:Tillandsialog800pix.jpg|thumb|left|Indoor arrangement of six Tillandsia plants mounted on a log section.]] Although not normally cultivated for their flowers, some Tillandsia will bloom on a regular basis. In addition, it is quite common for some species to take on a different leaf colour (usually changing from green to red) when about to flower. This is an indication that the plant is monocarpic (flowers once before dying) but offsets around the flowering plant will continue to thrive.Temperature is not critical, the range being from 32°C down to 10°C. They are sensitive to frost, except for the hardiest species, T. usneoides, which can tolerate night-time frosts down to about -10°C.Tillandsia is a primary ingredient in Allerplex, a Standard Process herbal supplement to treat pollen allergies.SpeciesTillandsia aeranthosTillandsia ancepsTillandsia bulbosaTillandsia caput-medusaeTillandsia cyaneaTillandsia excelsaTillandsia fasciculataTillandsia flabellataTillandsia funckianaTillandsia gardneriTillandsia lindeniiTillandsia lorenzianaTillandsia paucifoliaTillandsia strictaTillandsia tenuifoliaTillandsia usneoidesTillandsia xerographica* Category:Plants named after peopleca:Clavellina d'aire de:Tillandsien es:Tillandsia fr:Tillandsia hsb:Módra tilandsija it:Tillandsia lt:Tilandsija nl:Tillandsia ja:チランジア no:Tillandsia pl:Oplątwa pt:Tillandsia ro:Tillandsia fi:Tillandsiat sv:Tillandsior zh:空氣鳳梨
