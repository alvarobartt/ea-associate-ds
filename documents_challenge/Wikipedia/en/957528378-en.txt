 Corporación Deportiva Independiente Medellín is a professional Colombian football (soccer) team competing in Fútbol Profesional Colombiano, the Colombian first division. The club is based in the city of Medellín and founded in 1913. It has won the league's national tournament known as Copa Mustang four times: in 1955, 1957, 2002-II and 2004-I. Its best performance at international level was in 2003, when the team achieved the third place in the Copa Libertadores de América.RivalriesMedellín's greatest rival is with the city's other major club Atlético Nacional, with whom they share the home stadium Atanasio Girardot. The team is dubbed "El Poderoso de la Montaña" or the powerful of the mountain due to Medellín's geographical location high in the Andean mountains. The rivalry is especially strong due to each team's main support club, Rexixtenxia Norte for Medellín and Los Del Sur for Atlético Nacional. The two clubs are named with the location that they occupy in the stadium where Rexixtenxia occupies the section behind the northern goal and Los Del Sur occupy the section behind the southern goal.In 2004 Medellín and Nacional classified to the final of the Mustang Cup; in Antioquia everybody was very excited because this was the first "Paisa" final of the history of the short tournaments. This system requires 2 games to be the champion, in the first game, Medellín won 2-1 with a goal of Rafael Castillo in the 87 minute after the goals of Jorge Serna (DIM) and Carlos "Chumi" Alvarez in the first half. The final game was in the 27 of June, and it ended 0-0 and Medellín became the champion of the Colombian National League.ControversiesMedellín won its third league title after 45 years of agony. However, there were two seasons where Medellín had the title within its reach only to lose it amid great controversy. From its foundation until 2002, the Colombian First Division League had adopted a league format commonly used in European leagues. The format was a year long tournament where the team at then end of the year in best standing was declared the winner. This format was changed in 2002 to an Apertura-Clausura format where two separate seasons are played during the year to determine two winners. In 1993 during the last game of the year, Medellín and Atlético Junior were fighting for a tight first place. Junior was playing América de Cali at home in Baranquilla while simultaneously Medellín played hometown rivals Atlético Nacional. The games were to start and end at the same time. A Medellín win with a Junior loss or draw would have given Medellín the title. Medellín beat Nacional 1-0 while awaiting the goalless game in Baranquilla to end. Medellín players were celebrating with a victory lap and giving interviews with reporters waiting for the final whistle in Baranquilla. However, the referee allowed an unprecedented amount of injury time which enabled Oswaldo Mackenzie to score an extremely late goal giving Junior the win and the title. This was not the first time Medellín had a heartbreaking season, in 1989 a year where Medellín had the best team in the league and was expected to win the title, a tragic event occurred in Colombian soccer. During the final games of the season, Medellín tied América de Cali 0-0 at home. During the game, the linesman Álvaro Ortega made a mistake and annulled a Medellín goal. Afterwards, a Medellín sympathizer hunted down the linesman and assassinated him. In response, the Colombian Soccer Federation decided to cancel the rest of the season leaving the 1989 league without a winner.Honours===Amateur===Copa Jimenez Jaramillo: 1923:: Copa Mustang ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Campeonato Nacional: 1938:: Copa Mustang ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Campeonato Departamental : 1937,1938,1939,1940,1942,1943,1944 y 1945 "DEPORTIVO INDEPENDIENTE MEDELLÍN ,EL PODEROSO" , es una publicación de El Colombiano Ltda. en Cia SCA.National HonoursFútbol Profesional ColombianoWinners (4): 1955, 1957, 2002-II, 2$$4Runners-Up (5): 1959, 1961, 1966, 1993, 2001Copa Colombia (1): 1981International HonoursCopa Libertadores3rd Place (1): 2003Copa Libertadores Participations1967 1st Round1994 Quarterfinals2003 Semifinals2005 Round of 16Current RosterAs of March 4th, 2008                     Reserve &amp; Youth Squad                    Source: http://www.eltiempo.com/deportes/futbol/fubolcolombiano/noticias/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3918772.htmlPlayers In Carlos Daniel Hidalgo FW From Sporting de Gijón Jhon Javier Restrepo MF From Deportivo VeracruzPlayers out Brayan López GK to Atlético Bucaramanga Notable Former PlayersReferencesExternal linksPagina oficial   Category:Colombian football clubs Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1913 Category:Independiente Medellínca:Corporación Deportiva Independiente Medellín de:Independiente Medellín es:Corporación Deportiva Independiente Medellín fr:Corporación Deportiva Independiente Medellín he:דפורטיבו אינדפנדיינטה מדיין nl:Independiente Medellín pl:Independiente Medellín pt:Corporación Deportiva Independiente Medellín ru:Индепендьенте Медельин
