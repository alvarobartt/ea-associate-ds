For the town, see Scilla, Italy. For the given name, see Priscilla. For the mythological monster, see Scylla.Scilla (squill) is a genus of bulb-forming perennial herbs in the Hyacinthaceae. The 90-odd species are found in woodlands, subalpine meadows, and seashores across the Old World. Their flowers are usually blue, but white, pink, and purple types are known; most flower in early spring, but a few are autumn-flowering.Several African species previously classified in Scilla have been removed to the genus Ledebouria. The best known of these is the common houseplant still sometimes known as Scilla violacea but now properly Ledebouria socialis.Species include:Scilla amoena (Star Squill/Star Hyacinth)Scilla autumnalis (Autumn Squill)Scilla bifolia (Alpine Squill)Scilla bithynica (Bithynian Squill)Scilla buekkensisScilla cilicicaScilla elisaeScilla drunensisScilla hohenackeriScilla hyacinthoidesScilla kladniiScilla liliohyacinthus (Pyrenean Squill)Scilla litardiereiScilla maritimaScilla messeniacaScilla mischtschenkoana (Tubergen Squill)Scilla monophyllosScilla natalensisScilla persicaScilla peruviana (Portuguese Squill/Corymbose Squill/Cuban Lily)Scilla puschkinioidesScilla roseniiScilla scilloidesScilla siberica (Siberian Squill)Scilla sieheiScilla spetanaScilla verna (Spring Squill)Scilla vindobonensisScilla peruviana is of interest for its name; it is a native of southwest Europe, not of Peru. When Carolus Linnaeus described the species in 1753, he was given specimens imported from Spain aboard a ship named Peru, and was misled into thinking the specimens had come from that country. The rules of botanical naming do not allow a scientific name to be changed merely because it is potentially confusing.Cultivation and usesMany species, notably S. siberica, are grown in gardens for their attractive early spring flowers.Squill liquid extract, a preparation of powdered squill bulbs extracted in ethanol, is an ingredient in cough medicines and cardiac surgery.External linksBritish Pharmaceutical CodexKing's American Dispensatoryhttp://www.plantzafrica.com* Category:Flowers cs:Ladoňka da:Skilla de:Blausterne es:Scilla eo:Scilo fr:Scille hsb:Česnička it:Scilla (botanica) he:בן-חצב lt:Scylė nl:Sterhyacint ja:ツルボ属 pl:Cebulica pt:Scilla (botânica) sr:Никсица
