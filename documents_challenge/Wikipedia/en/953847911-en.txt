]]Taymyr Autonomous Okrug (, Taymyrsky avtonomny okrug), or Taymyria, was a federal subject of Russia (an autonomous okrug of Krasnoyarsk Krai), the northernmost in mainland Russia (and thus Asia). It is named after the Taymyr Peninsula. It is also called Dolgan-Nenets Autonomous District (), by the name of the indigenous people, Dolgans and Nenetses.With an area of 862,100&nbsp;km² (ranked 4th) and a population of 39,786 (2002 Census), Taymyria was one of the least densely populated areas of Russia as of 2006. Dudinka, with more than half of Taymyria's inhabitants, is the administrative centre.Following a referendum on the issue held on April 17, 2005, Taymyr and Evenk Autonomous Okrugs were merged into Krasnoyarsk Krai effective January 1, 2007.Time zoneTaymyria is located in the Krasnoyarsk Time Zone (KRAT/KRAST). UTC offset is +0700&nbsp;(KRAT)/+0800&nbsp;(KRAST).Administrative divisions   The city of Norilsk, even though it is geographically located within Taymyr Autonomous Okrug, was administratively subordinated directly to Krasnoyarsk Krai prior to the merger. This also applied to the urban-type settlement of Snezhnogorsk, which was administratively subrodinated to Norilsk. Therefore, the okrug's population reported by the Census authorities does not include the populations of Norilsk and Snezhnogorsk.Taymyr In Popular CultureAlthough not actually having been filmed in Taymyr, it is depicted in the 1985 film White Nights, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines. During the opening moments of the film, Baryshnikov's character Nikolai Rodchenko-a Soviet defector-is on a passenger plane that crash lands at "Norilsk Air Base." He inevitably is taken into the home of Hines' character-a US defector-and his wife (played by Isabella Rossellini), where they advise him that he is in Taymyr upon regaining consciousness.DemographicsPopulation (2002): 39,786.Ethnic groups: Of the 39,786 residents (as of the 2002 census) 1,018 (2.6%) chose not to specify their ethnic background.
