Sedum acre, the Goldmoss Stonecrop, Goldmoss Sedum, Biting Stonecrop or Wallpepper, is a perennial plant native to Europe, but also naturalised in North America. This plant grows as a creeping ground cover, often in dry sandy soil, but also in the cracks of masonry. It grows well in poor soils, sand, rock gardens,and rich dirt; and in a variety of light conditions. It does not thrive in dense shade with limited water.The leaves are simple, smooth-margined, and succulent. The flowers are yellow, Spring-blooming, in sprays held above the foliage. It spreads when allowed to do so, but is easily removed as it has shallow roots. It is lovely in hanging baskets and container gardens as a trailing accent, as borders, or as groundcover.
