Stabæk Fotball is the football section of Stabæk IF, a Norwegian sports club from Bekkestua in Bærum, founded in 1912.The team has played in the Norwegian Premier League since 1995 but was relegated after finishing second last in the 2004 season. However, they returned to the Premier League in its first attempt in 2005, and finished 5th. In 2007 they won silver, that is the best league position for Stabæk ever. In 1998 Stabæk won the Norwegian Cup, after a 3-1 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final.Currently, Stabæk has players nominated for many football awards in Norway, and Alan Carlos &quot;Alanzinho&quot; Gomes da Costa, Daniel Nannskog and Veigar Pall Gunnarsson are among the favourites to win one of these prizes.StadiumStabæk play their home games at Nadderud stadion, a multi-use stadium owned by the Municipality of Bærum. It was opened in 1961 and given an overhaul ahead of the 1996 season when the current main stand was built. A small stand without roofing has since been built on the opposite side, giving the stadium a seated capacity of 4,700 and a total capacity of 7,000. The record attendance is an estimated 10,000 spectators, achieved in a cup game against Strømsgodset in 1970.In its current state, the stadium fails to meet national requirements for hosting football matches at the highest level. Stabæk have therefore been working towards moving to a new stadium, after initially seeking to buy and redevelop their current home ground. In 1999 the club settled on Fornebu, the site of a large urban development project. Lengthy negotiations between the club, the municipality and the area's main developer came to an end in 2005 and the plans gained final approval on June 21, 2006.The Telenor Arena will cost NOK425 million (€52.5 million) to construct and will have an all-seater capacity of 15,000. It will be entirely covered; the club originally planned for a retractable roof but due to the high costs involved there will instead be a fixed roof suspended 24 m above the pitch. Construction begun in February 2007.AchievementsNorwegian Premier League:Silver medal: 2007Bronze medal: 1998, 2003Norwegian Football Cup:Winners: 1998Recent historyRecordsGreatest home victory: 8-0 vs. Molde F.K., October 29, 2006Greatest away victory: 14-0 vs. Vestfossen Idrettsforening, May 12, 2008Heaviest home loss: 1-6 vs. Lillestrøm S.K., August 1, 1999Heaviest away loss: 1-8 vs. S.K.
