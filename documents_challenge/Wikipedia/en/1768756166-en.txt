While a teenager she acted in amateur productions, then trained as an actor at Rome's National Academy of Dramatic Arts (graduating in 1953) and at Pittman's College, where she played a teen in a charity performance of Dario Niccodemi's La nemica. She toured Germany with an Italian acting troupe and her first stage appearance in Rome was for a production of Niccolò Machiavelli's La Mandragola.[[Image:vittiavventura.jpg|thumb|right|Monica Vitti in L'avventura (1960).]] [[Image:Monicavitti reddesert.jpg|thumb|right|Monica Vitti in Il deserto rosso (1964)]] Vitti's first film role was in Ettore Scola's "Ridere Ridere Ridere" (1954). Her first important role was in Mario Amendola's "Le dritte" (1958). In 1957 she joined Michelangelo Antonioni's Teatro Nuovo di Milano under his direction, later playing a leading role in his internationally celebrated, award winning, and radically unconventional auteur movie, L'avventura (1960), as a detached and cool protagonist drifting into a relationship with the lover of her missing girlfriend. With a screen presence that has been described as "stunning", Vitti is also credited with helping Antonioni raise money for the production and sticking with him through its difficult location shooting. She later received critical praise for starring roles in other Antonioni films including La notte (1961), L'eclisse (1962), and Il deserto rosso (1964), which are regarded, with L'avventura, usually as a single series of 4 remarkable productions of similar style and topics.[[Image:Stardustflick.png|thumb|right|Monica Vitti in Polvere di stelle (1973).]] Since late 1960s, Monica Vitti decided to leave such cryptic style of Antonioni though, to do light comedies again and finding success so, for example like under the direction of Alberto Sordi (Polvere di stelle, 1973) and Ettore Scola (Dramma della gelosia, 1970) and co-starring with Marcello Mastroianni (Dramma della gelosia). Her only Hollywood effort was the title role in Modesty Blaise, a mod James Bond spoof with Terence Stamp (1966) which was of a moderate success with harsh critic reviews.Later careerSince the second half of the 1970s, Monica Vitti received a diminishing amount of offers for a role in cinema. Vitti's later movie appearances have mostly been in Italian films without international distribution. Notable exceptions include Luis Buñuel's Le Fantôme de la liberté (1974). She starred with Barbara Bouchet in L'Anantra all'arancia a farcical sex comedy in 1975. In 1980 she was reunited with Antonioni after 15 years in his Il mistero di Oberwald. In 1989 Monica Vitti wrote, directed and starred in Scandalo Segreto, which would mark her retirement off the screen of cinema.In 1986, Monica Vitti returned to the theater again, both as an actress and as a teacher. During the 1990s she did television works, acting and directing. Her image later appeared on an Italian postage stamp commemorating L'avventura. In 1993 Vitti was awarded the Festival Tribute at the Créteil International Women's Film Festival in France. She married Roberto Russo in 1995 after living with him since 1968.AwardsNastro d'Argento (Italy): 3 occasions (Best Supporting Actress: 1962.
