Fàbregas started his career as a trainee with FC Barcelona but was signed by Arsenal in September 2003. He did not feature much in his first season for The Gunners, but following injuries to key midfielders in the 2004–05 season, his playing time increased. Before long, he had established himself as Arsenal's starting central midfielder and playmaker. He went on to break several of the club's records, earning a reputation as a technically-gifted player. In international football, the Spaniard's national career began when he represented the Under-17 side at the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Finland. As a result of his club performances, he was called up to the senior squad in 2006. He has played in the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008, where he was one of the key players that helped Spain lift the trophy.Club careerEarly yearsFàbregas was born in 1987 to Francesc Fàbregas Sr., who runs a property company, and Núria Soler, the owner of a pastry company. Fàbregas has supported FC Barcelona since childhood and went to his first match when he was nine months old with his grandfather.Football: The Interview Francesc Fabregas - Spanish marvel blossoms , findarticles.com, accessed 22 June 2008. It was at FC Barcelona where Fàbregas began his club football career. Initially, he was played as a volante (defensive midfielder), yet he was also a prolific scorer, sometimes scoring more than 30 goals in a season for the club's youth teams. However, he did not manage to play a first-team game at the Camp Nou.Cesc Fabregas, uefa.com, accessed 23 May 2007. Sensing that he would have limited opportunities at Barcelona,The Young Gunner, thefa.com, 19 May 2005, accessed 24 May 2007. he joined Arsenal, signing for the London club on 11 September 2003.

As a 16-year-old, Fàbregas did not contemplate breaking into the first team immediately but looked up to senior players like Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva, while concentrating on training and learning the English language. He nevertheless made his début for Arsenal not long after, on 23 October 2003, in a League Cup tie at home to Rotherham United. In doing so he became Arsenal's youngest ever first-team player, aged 16 years and 177 days.Cesc Fabregas becomes Arsenal's youngest ever player, arsenal.com, 27 January 2006, accessed 22 May 2007.

His first match of the season was against Manchester United in the Community Shield. Following an injury to Vieira, Fàbregas stepped in and made four consecutive Premier League starts. He was praised for his performances in those games, even claiming a goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 3–0 victory, and becoming Arsenal's youngest ever goalscorer in a league game.Hughes, Ian, &quot;Fabregas the fabulous&quot;, news.bbc.co.uk, 27 August 2004, accessed 22 May 2007.Arsenal 3-0 Blackburn, soccernet.espn.go.com, 25 August 2004, accessed 23 May 2007.

He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability to fill in the void left by the Frenchman.Hubbard, Norman, &quot;Arsenal's midfield muddle&quot;, soccernet.espn.go.com, 22 August 2005, accessed 23 May 2007.

Fàbregas functions mostly as a playmaker and his main asset is his passing range. As one of the most coveted young talents in the game today, he has been described as being a vital part of Arsenal's first team, bringing vision, creativity and selflessness to Arsenal's intricate passing game, and displaying maturity that belies his age.Smith, Alan, &quot;Fabregas puts his skates on in chase for perfection&quot;, telegraph.co.uk, 20 January 2007, accessed 23 May 2007.McIlvanney, Hugh, &quot;Fàbregas a leader in waiting&quot;, timesonline.co.uk, 26 March 2006, accessed 22 May 2007.

In that sense he is of a different mould from his Arsenal predecessors who play in the same position, preferring skill over strength. Initially, this led to criticisms of his lightweight frame and less aggressive style of play, with even former teammate Ashley Cole criticising the Spaniard as "an unproven featherweight" in his autobiography.Macintosh, Iain, "Completely Fab", The New Paper, 29 September 2007.However, Fàbregas' statistics have improved over the seasons, and he has adopted a more aggressive style of play. His importance to the team as the main creative force is also reflected in his contributing 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006–07 season. By his own admission, scoring was a weaker part of his game in his first few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, although Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring.Wenger: Fabregas has the vision of Platini, arsenal.com, 19 September 2007, accessed 4 January 2008.Wenger: 'This team is blossoming and growing', arsenal.com, 15 September 2007, accessed 17 September 2007.
