 |champion=Kayserispor  The Türkiye Kupası (currently known under the terms of a sponsorship deal as the Fortis Türkiye Kupası) is a football cup competition in Turkish football, run by the Turkish Football Federation since 1962. The current holders are Kayserispor, who beat Gençlerbirliği S.K. on penalties in the 2008 final in Bursa.OverviewAll 54 teams playing in Turkey's Super Lig and Second League competitions play in the competition, with all Super League teams receiving a bye until at least round two. In the first round, the 36 teams playing in Second League categories A and B are paired off to play each other in a single-match playoff in round one. The winners proceed to the second stage, where they are joined by the fourteen teams that finished between 5th and 18th position in the previous season's Super League.Round three in the Turkish Cup is a league system, where the top four teams from last season's Super League and the sixteen winning teams from round two are placed into four groups of five. The four top Super League teams are seeded and cannot be placed into the same group. All teams play each other once, with the top two teams in each group proceeding to the quarter finals, from where the Cup becomes a standard knockout competition.The winner of the competition qualifies directly for the following year's UEFA Cup. Where the winner has already secured European qualification, the UEFA Cup place goes to first to the cup finalist, then to the highest-ranking Super League team without a European place. This happened in the 2005-06 season, when cup winners Beşiktaş had already guaranteed UEFA Cup placement by finishing third in the league and finalists Fenerbahçe had qualified for the Champions League. The remaining UEFA Cup place went to fourth-placed Trabzonspor.The competition's name was changed to the "Federation Cup" in 1980, until it was reverted in 1993. In 2005, the Turkish Cup followed the Super League in signing a sponsorship deal with Fortis bank.The Turkish Football Federation awards a trophy to the winning club and a total of 35 medals to the players, coaches, presidents and the members of the technical boards of the final playing teams.Cup winners by seasonSeasonWinnerRunner UpScoreline2007-2008]]KayserisporGençlerbirligi0-0 (pen 11-10)2006-2007]]Beşiktaş J.K.Kayseri Erciyesspor1-0 aet2005-2006]]Beşiktaş J.K.Fenerbahçe SK3-2 aet2004-2005]]Galatasaray SKFenerbahçe SK5-12003-2004]]TrabzonsporGençlerbirliği4-02002-2003TrabzonsporGençlerbirliği3-12001-2002KocaelisporBeşiktaş J.K.4-02000-2001GençlerbirliğiFenerbahçe SK2-2 (pen 4-1)1999-2000Galatasaray SKAntalyaspor5-3 aet1998-1999Galatasaray SKBeşiktaş J.K.0-0, 2-01997-1998Beşiktaş J.K.Galatasaray SK1-1, 1-1 (pen 4-2)1996-1997KocaelisporTrabzonspor1-1, 1-01995-1996Galatasaray SKFenerbahçe SK1-0, 1-1 aet1994-1995TrabzonsporGalatasaray SK3-2, 1-01993-1994Beşiktaş J.K.Galatasaray SK3-2, 0-01992-1993Galatasaray SKBeşiktaş J.K.1-0, 2-21991-1992TrabzonsporBursaspor0-3, 5-11990-1991Galatasaray SKMKE Ankaragücü3-1 aet1989-1990Beşiktaş J.K.Trabzonspor2-01988-1989Beşiktaş J.K.Fenerbahçe SK1-0, 2-11987-1988SakaryasporSamsunspor2-0, 1-11986-1987GençlerbirliğiEskişehirspor5-0, 1-21985-1986BursasporAltay SK2-01984-1985Galatasaray SKTrabzonspor2-1, 0-01983-1984TrabzonsporBeşiktaş J.K.2-01982-1983Fenerbahçe SKMersin İY2-0, 2-11981-1982Galatasaray SKMKE Ankaragücü3-0, 1-21980-1981MKE AnkaragücüBoluspor2-1, 0-01979-1980Altay SKGalatasaray SK1-0, 1-1 aet1978-1979Fenerbahçe SKAltay SK1-2, 2-01977-1978TrabzonsporAdana DS3-0, 0-01976-1977TrabzonsporBeşiktaş J.K.1-0, 0-01975-1976Galatasaray SKTrabzonspor0-1, 1-0 (pen 5-4)1974-1975Beşiktaş J.K.Trabzonspor0-1, 2-01973-1974Fenerbahçe SKBursaspor0-1, 3-01972-1973Galatasaray SKMKE Ankaragücü3-1, 1-11971-1972MKE AnkaragücüAltay SK0-0, 3-01970-1971EskişehirsporBursaspor0-1, 2-01969-1970Göztepe SKEskişehirspor1-2, 3-11968-1969Göztepe SKGalatasaray SK1-0, 1-1 aet1967-1968Fenerbahçe SKAltay SK2-0, 0-11966-1967Altay SKGöztepe SK2-2 **1965-1966Galatasaray SKBeşiktaş J.K.1-01964-1965Galatasaray SKFenerbahçe SK0-0, 1-01963-1964Galatasaray SKAltay SK0-0, 3-0 *1962-1963Galatasaray SKFenerbahçe SK2-1, 2-1* Altay didn't play second leg.** Altay won the cup by coin toss.Number of cups won by clubsClubChampionshipsTotal44   Category:Türkiye Kupası Turkey Cup, Turkish Footballca:Copa turca de futbol de:Türkiye Kupası es:Copa de Turquía fr:Coupe de Turquie de football it:Coppa di Turchia lt:Turkijos futbolo taurė hu:Török labdarúgókupa nl:Turkse Beker pl:Puchar Turcji w piłce nożnej ru:Кубок Турции по футболу tr:Fortis Türkiye Kupası
