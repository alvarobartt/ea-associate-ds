PlotRJ the Raccoon (Bruce Willis), after unsuccessfully trying to get a snack item from a vending machine, ventures into the cave of a hibernating bear named Vincent (Nick Nolte). While attempting to steal Vincent's cache of goods, RJ accidentally wakes Vincent, who after realizing what RJ is doing, attempts to scare him into giving his stuff back. While RJ tries to talk his way out of trouble, Vincent's cache rolls out of the cave, down to a street, and is destroyed by a passing truck. The furious Vincent threatens to kill RJ. RJ saves himself by offering to get all the goods back.RJ finds the new suburban development El Rancho Camelot Estates in western Indiana where he can steal all the replacement items he needs. There, a community of foragers led by the practical turtle Verne (Gary Shandling), awakens from hibernation. Verne immediately directs his charges - Hammy (Steve Carell), the hyperactive squirrel; Stella the skunk (Wanda Sykes); Ozzie the opossum (William Shatner) and his daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne) and porcupines Lou (Eugene Levy), his wife Penny (Catherine O'Hara), and their young off-spring Spike (Shane Baumel), Bucky (Sami Kirkpatrick), and Quillo (Madison Davenport) - to start their yearly search for food to store.They discover a hedge, which they had never seen before. Verne, while looking around the other side, is mauled and retreats explaining the dangers over the hedge. RJ, coming onto the scene, prompts them to scavenge for food and treasures he promises they'll find beyond the hedge, while Verne fears for what traps or predators also await. Yet a determined and desperate RJ convinces the woodland creatures to explore. Using a combination of con artistry and caper movie antics, they successfully snatch the goods RJ needs to appease Vincent, unaware of RJs debt.All this prompts the ire of the homeowners' association president Gladys Sharp (Allison Janney), who hires a pest-control specialist Dwayne LaFontant (Thomas Haden Church), who calls himself "The Verminator". Seeing this, and realizing that they might be in danger, Verne tries to return everything they've stolen as a bargain to the humans to spare their lives. However, this fails as RJ tries to stop Verne and the hoard is destroyed in the resulting chaos.Afterwards, the foragers present RJ with a makeshift place to sleep, and RJ can't resist having a growing affection for all of them. He slowly realizes that he should not be using them for his own needs and wonders if he should expose his secret and break their hearts. While speaking alone with Verne, RJ tries to show him a list of what he needs, so he can explain the true situation; but at the last moment he lies, and they devise a raid on a nearby party at Gladys's house using RJ's list.While collecting food from the party, the foragers are caught when RJ argues with Verne about the importance of some chips (a can of Spuddies, Vincent's favorite snack), and RJ blurts out the truth. RJ retreats with the loot while the foragers are captured and caged. After giving Vincent the stolen food, RJ watches the Verminator's van drive past, and decides to save his friends. RJ shoves the wagon over the hill into the path of the Verminator's van, preventing him from driving any further as the impact from the collision knocked him out cold. As they drive back to the development, Vincent grabs hold of the van and is trying to kill RJ until he floats away with a set of balloons. After they make a crash landing at Gladys's house, the foragers run back to their home through the hedge. Much to their disbelief, Vincent managed to float back down, and now they must try to avoid getting killed by their enemies.Trapped in the hedge between Vincent pulling sections out the hedge, Dwayne trying to shock them, and Gladys Sharp breaking the hedge with a weed hacker; RJ gives Hammy a caffeinated energy drink, causing him to move at light speed. He uses his increased speed to set the Verminator's traps against their assailants. Vincent, The Verminator and Gladys are trapped, being arrested for the use of inhumane traps, with Vincent being shipped to a preserve, and RJ and Tiger (a cat they had to fool to steal the food from the party, who is in love with Stella) are welcomed to the foragers as part of the family.ReceptionThe film's opening weekend grossed $38,457,003 in 4,093 theaters.

Critic Frank Lovece of Film Journal International found that, "DreamWorks' slapstick animated adaptation of the philosophically satiric comic strip ... is a lot of laughs and boasts a much tighter story than most animated features"[http://filmjournal.com/filmjournal/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002539020 Film Journal International: Over the Hedge review by Frank Lovece] Ken Fox of TVGuide.com called it "a sly satire of American 'enough is never enough' consumerism and blind progress at the expense of the environment. It's also very funny, and the little woodland critters that make up the cast are a kiddie-pleasing bunch".[http://online.tvguide.com/newsearch/detail.aspx?id=46819&amp;sourcetype=m&amp;progseriesparentid=0&amp;tvobjectid=0&amp;keyword=&amp;more=ucmoviereview TV Guide Online Over the Hedge review by Ken Fox] Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper of Ebert &amp; Roeper gave the animated movie a "two thumbs up".[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060518/REVIEWS/60509002/1023 RogerEbert.com: Chicago Sun-Times (May 19 2006): Over the Hedge review by Roger Ebert] Rottentomatoes.com: Richard RoeperA short film called Hammy's Boomerang Adventure was released with the Over the Hedge DVD.Cast===Animals===CharacterAnimal TypeActorRJRaccoonBruce WillisVerneBox TurtleGarry ShandlingHammyAmerican Red SquirrelSteve CarellStellaStriped SkunkWanda SykesOzzieVirginia OpossumWilliam ShatnerVincentAmerican Black BearNick NolteHeatherVirginia OpossumAvril LavigneLouNorth American PorcupineEugene LevyPennyNorth American PorcupineCatherine O'HaraTigerPersian Cat]]Omid DjaliliBuckyNorth American PorcupineSami KirkpatrickSpikeNorth American PorcupineShane BaumelQuilloNorth American PorcupineMadison DavenportNugentRottweilerBrian StepanekHumansCharacterGenderActorDwayne LaFontantMaleThomas Haden ChurchGladys SharpFemaleAllison JanneyTwo minor human characters, appearing during the dog chase scene, were voiced by Lee Bienstock and Sean Yazbeck, two participants on ''The Apprentice 5'' as part of a reward for winning a task.SoundtrackVideogameReferencesExternal linksOfficial siteCategory:2006 films Category:American films Category:Films featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Family films Category:2000s comedy films Category:Computer-animated films Category:DreamWorks Animation films Category:DreamWorks films Category:English-language films Category:Films about animals Category:Films based on comic strips Category:German-language films Category:Paramount films Category:Annie Award winnersar:عبر السياج cy:Over the Hedge (ffilm) da:Over hækken (film) de:Ab durch die Hecke es:Vecinos invasores fa:آن‌ سوی پرچین fr:Nos voisins, les hommes ko:헷지 id:Over the Hedge (film) it:La gang del bosco he:מעבר ליער lt:Anapus tvoros hu:Túl a sövényen nl:Over the Hedge ja:森のリトル・ギャング no:Over hekken pl:Skok przez płot pt:Over the Hedge ru:Лесная братва fi:Yli aidan sv:Over the Hedge th:แก๊งค์สี่ขา ข้ามป่ามาป่วนเมือง
