Gnarls Barkley is an American musical collaboration between multi-instrumentalist and producer Danger Mouse (Brian Burton) from New York, and rapper/vocalist Cee-Lo Green (Thomas Callaway), from Atlanta. Their first album, St. Elsewhere, was released in 2006; it and their first hit, "Crazy", were major commercial successes, and were noted for their large sales by download. The duo released their second album, The Odd Couple, in March of 2008.HistoryBackgroundGnarls Barkley is a two-person musical group. Prior to their collaboration, both had their own lengthy careers. Cee-Lo first entered the music scene as part of the Atlanta hip hop group Goodie Mob which had a large hand in the Dirty South Movement of the 1990s. Cee-Lo left the group after their third album in 1999 and started his solo career. He released two solo albums, one in 2002, and one in 2004. Danger Mouse has produced for a number of hip-hop artists, and he produced Gorillaz' Grammy winning album Demon Days. He received national attention for his mash-up Grey Album, which blended samples from Jay-Z's The Black Album and the Beatles' White Album.They first met in 2003 when Cee-Lo was on a tour for which Danger Mouse happened to be the DJ. They began working together on the songs that would become the St. Elsewhere album; prior to the release of that album they collaborated on the songs "What You Sittin' On?" for Lex Records in 2004, and "Benzie Box" from the Dangerdoom album The Mouse and the Mask in 2005. They took the name Gnarls Barkley for their project as a duo. Burton explains the collaboration's name came from friends, "making up fictional celebrity names like Prince Gnarls and Bob Gnarley." When Heavens' Josiah Steinbrick came up with Gnarls Barkley, Burton wrote it down.''St. Elsewhere'' (2006–2008)Downtown Records in the U.S. and Warners Bros. Records in the UK signed the band after several songs including "Crazy" were played for them by Danger Mouse's management company Waxploitation. "Crazy" was released as their first single on April 3, 2006, preceded by its release as digital download and 12" vinyl record single in March 2006. It gained some of its popularity due to its use on primetime BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe's television advert, and it was also made Record of the Week by Ken Bruce of BBC Radio 2, Scott Mills and Jo Whiley of BBC Radio 1 as well as being made 'Weekend Anthem' by DJ Spoony and Sara Cox (also of Radio 1). "Crazy" is the first ever single to top the UK singles chart purely on download sales as it was released online a week before it was released as a CD single. It is also the first single to top the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks consecutively since 1994 when Wet Wet Wet's "Love Is All Around" was number one for 15 weeks (the last song to spend exactly nine weeks on top was "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1984). It has also equaled the Queen 1975 classic "Bohemian Rhapsody", which also topped the UK singles chart for nine weeks. "Crazy" is also the longest number-one on the UK Official Download Chart with its stay lasting eleven consecutive weeks. Gnarls Barkley announced that as the record had spent its ninth week at number one, it was to be deleted as a vinyl/CD listing from May 28, 2006 so people will "remember the song fondly and not get sick of it".The group released their debut album, St. Elsewhere, on April 24, 2006 in the UK and on May 9, 2006 in the U.S.. For their American television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, May 24, 2006, the band performed their smash hit, "Crazy".
