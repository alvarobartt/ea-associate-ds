It is connected to the thyroid cartilage; supported by the muscles of the neck and in turn supports the root of the tongue.The hyoid bone is shaped like a horseshoe, and is suspended from the tips of the styloid processes of the temporal bones by the stylohyoid ligaments.SegmentsIt consists of five segments:body of hyoidgreater cornu (2)lesser cornu (2)OssificationThe hyoid is ossified from six centers: two for the body, and one for each cornu. Ossification commences in the greater cornua toward the end of fetal life, in the body shortly afterward, and in the lesser cornua during the first or second year after birth.Muscle attachmentsThe following muscles are attached to the hyoid:superiorMiddle pharyngeal constrictor muscleHyoglossus muscleDigastric muscleStylohyoid muscleGeniohyoid muscleMylohyoid muscleGenioglossusinferiorThyrohyoid muscleOmohyoid muscleSternohyoid muscleFunctionThough the hyoid bone is present in many mammals, its descent in living creatures is unique to Homo sapiens, allowing for the production of a wide range of sounds that other animals cannot produce.http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/12/6930 Descent of the larynx in chimpanzee infants It allows a wider range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation. The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities.Arsenburg, B. et al., A reappraisal of the anatomical basis for speech in middle Paleolithic hominids, in: American Journal of Physiological Anthropology 83 (1990), pp. 137-146 However, other researchers have claimed that the morphology of the hyoid is not indicative of the larynx's position.Fitch, Tecumseh W., The evolution of speech: a comparative review, in: Trends in Cognitive Science, Vol. 4, No. 7, July 2000 (http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~junwang4/langev/localcopy/pdf/fitch00speech.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;FractureDue to its position, the hyoid bone is not usually easy to fracture in most situations. In cases of suspicious death, a fractured hyoid is a strong sign of strangulation. However this is not the case in adolescents due to the fact that it is still flexible, unbreakable.EtymologyIts name is derived from the Greek word hyoeides meaning "shaped like the letter upsilon" (υ).Additional imagesImage:Illu larynx.jpg|Larynx
