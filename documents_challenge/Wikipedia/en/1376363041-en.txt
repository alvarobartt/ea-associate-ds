After graduation in 1958, he served in a number of junior positions before being posted to Malaya in 1962 for operational service. From 1966 to 1969 he served in Papua New Guinea. During this posting, he married Marlena Kerr of Sydney (together with whom he had three sons, a daughter and seven subsequent grandchildren). This was followed by a tour of duty in Vietnam during which he was awarded the Military Cross (MC). - Military Cross announcement. Jeffery remained convinced that Australia's participation in the Vietnam War was right. "I believe passionately that Vietnam was a just cause in the circumstances of the time," he said during a 2002 speech to Australian veterans of the war.Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, Western Australia branch 40th anniversary reunion.

In 1975, he assumed command of the SAS in Perth, and was then promoted to Colonel as the first Director of the Army's Special Action Forces (7 January 1976 – 22 October 1977). He was instrumental in developing the surveillance concept for Northern Australia and as Director of Special Action Forces, he prepared the development of the Australian Counter terrorist concept and capability.From 1981 to 1983 he headed Australia's national counter-terrorist co-ordination authority.

In 1990 he became Deputy Chief of the General Staff and in 1991 he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff for Materiel.Although he retired from the army in 1993, he is still considered the "Honorary Colonel" of the SASR, where he holds the ceremonial role of inducting new soldiers into the regiment and presenting them with their famous sandy beret.Governor of Western AustraliaIn November 1993 Jeffery was appointed Governor of Western Australia, and in June 1996 he became a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).It's an Honour - Companion of the Order of Australia - 11 June 1996Citation: For service to the Crown as Governor of Western Australia and to the community, particularly through providing leadership in his commitment to the initiation and promotion of youth programmes to address contemporary social problems. He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) on 1 April 2000. - CVO announcement.It's an Honour - The Royal Victorian Order, Commander - 01 April 2000During his seven years in the post he made a number of public statements of his conservative views on marriage, sex and education, and received some criticism from the Labor opposition and sections of the media for appearing to take positions on political issues.On the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, for example, General Jeffery said: "Baser instincts are titillated in the television displays of events like the Mardi Gras, where the colour and spectacle of fancy dress camouflages a public display of simulated homosexual activity and the degradation of traditional religions in the name of humour."He also said: "A British study found a direct statistical link between single parenthood and virtually every type of major crime, including mugging, violence against strangers, car theft and burglary. And the same is true...in Western Australia."Governor-GeneralStyle and Title: His Excellency Major General (Ret'd) Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC Governor-General of the Commonwealth of AustraliaFollowing the resignation of Governor-General Dr Peter Hollingworth, Prime Minister John Howard announced on 22 June 2003 that he had chosen Major-General Jeffery to succeed him. He was formally appointed by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, and was sworn in on 11 August 2003, becoming the first Australian soldier to become Governor-General.His appointment was generally welcomed, although there was some critical comment about the appointment of another Anglo-Australian male to the post, and also some comment about his conservative views. A journalist wrote in The Australian: "Jeffery is Howard's perfect Governor-General. The ex-soldier is deeply conservative, steeped in the military and strong on traditional family values."Jeffery made no apologies for his outspokenness, and commented that: "I think I will be able to talk on issues and principles and values and standards quite comfortably as Governor-General." While in office, however, he kept a very low profile. Some journalists speculated that he had been instructed to do so by Howard. Only 14% of people interviewed for a newspaper survey in August 2006 recognised his photograph.Courier Mail surveyIn 2007, in his position as Governor-General, Major General Jeffery was appointed as the Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps, succeeding the previous Colonel-in-Chief, HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.
