 In his long life (he died eighty completed one)
lived many years outside Spain - in Naples, Lisbon, Rio, Dresden, Moscow, Frankfurt, Washington,
Brussels, Vienna - with diplomatic posts that gave him or the government withdrew as it were
governed by political friends and enemies. And he wanted and got actively involved in politics, as
a deputy in various legislatures, and even became Secretary of State but very little time and
for the September Revolution of 1868, as glorious as fleeting.
