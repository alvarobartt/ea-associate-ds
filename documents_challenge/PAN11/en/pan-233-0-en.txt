 Dolores told me about a conversation he had with Miss the master
about me ...

- You see?

Dolores misunderstood. You mom is not brave. And if not, now I find out.

- Do not do it, girl Adelita, no, for the love of God, "replied the
slave so scared, stopping the girl in a chant of her dress.

By itself, or not, you'd better not see me now Miss. Is there a doctor?

- Well, I want to see you alone. Arrange mode. With Dolores'll let
you know.

What do you want Doctor?

- For a tan that have brought the mountain bitten by dogs.

- Bitten
by the dogs!

Adela repeated. Ay! It must be very serious case when they call doctor. If you have torn!
Probably. Those dogs are like beasts. What horror My God! Mateu, said loudly, looking around
him.

Indeed very strange things started out for Elizabeth to the family under whose roof was hosted

unheard of for her, Elizabeth could not hide Leonardo, nor his intense
dislike or their deep emotions.

- What do you have?

What has given you? he asked.

- I do not know, "she said. I feel bad.

- I thought, "continued Leonard, you had affected the tale of wounded
black. Do not be boba. What bet that has not been more the thing?
Do not spend a few scratches? If you knew the nurse would think like
me. Mom can not see it as outrageous. Nor is there they never give
full credit to what they say blacks
