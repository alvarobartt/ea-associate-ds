 This could see the whole picture and unhindered. Barrier formed front crossed the mountain
opposite the hill on the left, and another that was to my right, well populated with vegetation
at the base, very dark brown in the middle, from top to bottom, of what might be called its
trunk crud√≠simo green on the other half, and with the huge gray head, like a skinned skull,
dry environment to the left shoulder with the white bones in the air too. I had the effect that vast
green patch, fine and juicy, then almost face illuminated by a ray of sun, a patch of velvet
rich in a garment of coarse sackcloth.
