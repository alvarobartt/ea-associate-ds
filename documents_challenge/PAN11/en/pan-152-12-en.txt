 Bad remedy
     would be the wedding. Increase the rebellion and mutiny. His Your
     daughter would be put to the head. We could not resist. The
     three would have to go with the music elsewhere. Finally, Don Paco,
     Juanita says that the wedding would be crazy. Says, finally, that
     she did not send in your heart, that age difference is great
     between you and you do not want to love, though he professes friendship
     thinner. It would therefore be very ugly Part of her abusing the
     generosity of you to meet ambition or vanity married by calculation,
     and would also be very silly, because the calculation would be wrong.

The
     best and most discreet is that you do not get married and that no
know you gave this step.

     Doña Inés hate us if we accept the proposition you, but we hate and
     we further declare war if you find that we do not accept,
     looking as to despise his father with unfounded arrogance. Matter
     So hide all this.
     
     Here I return to you your letter.

     Tear and rip mine to is no written proof of what happened, and keep
     you in your memory fond memories of us. Believe in our deep gratitude
     and faithfully send your constant friend and servant, qbsm,

Juana
     Gutierrez.
