 I have no doubt
to ensure that even the principles, would not drop the annual increases in the thirty villages
in the province of 300,000 pesos, and I found this sum settlement of government general of the province
as well as particular to each people.

To establish the proposed arrangement was necessary to the principles which de Buenos Aires Some
people send a lot of money, even 2 or 3,000 pesos for each village, Without it nothing would
be verifiable, and being sure thing that many people are not there equity, the royal treasury
could suplírseles to snuff account that would benefit later. To this decision I think there
would be no pregnancy, because the mercy of His Majesty crossing in the new ordinance their real assets
to help the needy Indians, supplying them by way of loan, without interest, they need to promote
them, delivering them and of the divisions that suffered before. And although that provision is
directed to assist individuals, and this the common, as in common include individuals, should be
by the same, taking it the advantage of greater security in the collection, which I the most
backward village concept, the second or third year, and would have satisfied what had supplied.

Having to be so vast management factors, and these subjects, as expressed, I think debérseles
noted ten percent of the profits which will be at the factory, that is the same as indicated by law
to guardians of minors by the administration of its goods, but should not be allowed any money
or merchandise is special in itself, nor intermediary, nor any thing that use of the factory,
except the room, which should be the principal houses, not anything else. And if for would
ease the work they wanted to have a dependent, was Spanish or Indian, should pay for the work
that have gone on their profits, not understanding that the who run the grocery stores, foremen
or other employees in the benefit, preservation and increased the factory, because they, like
all other laborers and workers, they should pay their salaries and wages of the management
body, as they worked to their advantage and utility, and all other expenses that were offered
in the village that had no relationship or are intended to benefit the assets of the factory, the
person should be the utility that this corresponded, such as food and costumes of old handicapped,
sick priest poor salaries of justices, actual payment of taxes, tithes and any useful or pious work
to be established for the benefit of the common, as we will express where appropriate.

With the allocation of ten percent to the factors I think people would
not be wanting useful that serve them, considering that the peoples
of a middling amount at least to 10,000 pesos in profits, as evidenced
by, and they will correspond to factor 1,000 pesos.

And although some do not amount to as much, always had the hope of promotions as merit and
circumstances of each, to reach the most profitable. Well it would be desirable that any so-called
ascent without having first served five years in the occupied village, being convenient mudasen
not very often.

For the Indian steward of each village were applied to the performance of this important commission,
and had no reason to apologize for any embezzlement, it should be
noted two percent of the profits of the factory.

And appears quite what I have specified in order to economic government
of the people, and assets of their communities, so that you know the
utilities would continue to be, way to express to you that I understand
should be established in general province.

For the newest provisions of His Majesty are thirty people in this province subject to the
jurisdiction only governor with them in the military and justice
causes, leaving the two branches of police and real estate by the
Governors mayors of Buenos Aires and Paraguay, each in the district
of his bishopric.

And because I have not seen but in passing the ordinances, nor is my intention to express to
you the convenience and desconveniencias than his total adherence to these peoples could follow,
depending on circumstances of them, I will tell you what I think should, through the knowledge that
with practice I have purchased. Although always keep the spirit and provisions of the new ordinances,
general as to what their establishment in this colony.

According to the knowledge that assists me in the situation of this province, marriage, relationship
and dependency some people have with others, and other circumstances that are very noticeable,
and it would Referring neat, I think that the best thing would be
if they remained united all thirty people, at least twenty-six, excluding
or separating the four most immediate Paraguay, which are Santiago,
Santa Rosa, Our Lady of Fe and San Ignacio Guazú, who have little
or no relation with others, and are best placed to add to that province,
and were ruled by a governor-mayor who had charge of all classes in
the same manner as other newly created, with power to appoint sub-delegation
in the parts as needed, for to my knowledge, one should be put an
the six towns comprising the department of San Miguel, and one in
four of Yapeyú; and if the people of Santiago department were to be
subject to this province governance, should be put there another,
and the remaining villages would be all subjects the immediate command
of the governor, because they are near Candelaria, which should be
the capital.

The limits of this province, she felt even in all the thirty towns, I dies should be as follows:
on the northern side, Tebicuari River from its headwaters Ñembucú to the estuary, on the west, the
estuary to the Paraná, crossing over below the falls, following the Ibera Lagoon, including land
that is the band West of the lagoon and its slopes fall to it, and following a search for
the origin Miriñay River, which may serve as a boundary on that side to Uruguay, crossing a
seek Cuarey mouth of the river, which may serve as limits on the south side, following to its origin
and going in between the headwaters of Black River and looking Ibicuy Portugal's borders, they
serve the term of this band.

Excluding the four villages mentioned above, could serve as limits on the band's north, the Monte
Grande de Santiago, and its marshes and swamps, which are to enter
the Falls in the Paraná, and otherwise as aforesaid.

But, as I believe, will these people in a few years make such overtaking I judge may be subject
to a bishopric erected them with incomes ping that of Paraguay, and then another district or
division should be limits, I will propose to you for consideration and tell me what you think,
because if that was the case.

I can not seem to hide the convenience and utility of the latter river. The Current city and its
jurisdiction have their treatment and turn in these people and keep
some useful correspondence dependence and its business and trade,
the profits would be higher each other if they were under a single
government.

This province borders the Portugal domains across the band from the east, and in times of
disagreement with that crown not have the governor in that province but Indians to fend off
invasions, and Buenos Aires must send you the aid of Spanish people,
and having under his command to Corrientes, had in them a speedy and
effective relief for any emergency.

The drawbacks to this division may be offered ignore them, and thus manifest only conveniences that
you know, as I reach.

Is so short that these natives pay tribute to His Majesty, that even
in the day is not enough to cover salaries and synods accruing to
employees that the charge of the exchequer, though they are very moderate.

And if you put a governor mayor with the authority such employment is, would need to assign
a salary provided, and would be taxed more the royal treasury, and so it does not happen, I
think it would be best and the governor subdelegates as they pay their salaries from the profits
resulting to the factories; then, having to address the new form of government for good and
utility of natural these costs would be as regular their benefit be established, mostly being found
so relieved in taxes. And so I think the utilities of all peoples bring forth out of two and
a half percent, and distribute them in this way: the governor-half percent than surrender
all people, with more than two per cent of the people who were only in their care, and two percent
subdelegados of who produced the their immediate care. Thus each other would seek the advancement
of the peoples, for claimed it theirs.

Should the governor or lieutenant had a consultant lawyer, an assistant and clerk government, and
also had a protector of Indians and a tax lawyer, otherwise could not be a good way this government,
and to pay these five places could be Take three percent of profits, pointing to each one what
they seem appropriate.

It would also be desirable to be bred a minister of the royal treasury, with the necessary dependent
actual salary paid, to tend to the recovery of real rights, real taxes and other belonging to His
Majesty, and especially the tobacco industry, which here are better than in Paraguay, and could
anticipate their cultivation and under high magnification of real estate.

The town of Candelaria is very suitable for their situation and provide for capital the province,
and it was with more luster and brilliance could be obtained from Her Majesty the grace that
awarded him the title and privileges of city, thus getting there
courts and other ministries that after say, I have no doubt soon be
increased population with the many Spanish who avecindarían there.

For people flourish in the sciences and the arts would be more convenient than the town of Candelaria
establish a school for letters and a hospice for arts; the first
should be taught from the first letters to theology, jurisprudence,
scholastic medicine and other sciences should be had to teach these
natives with all other parts of education and police, with young people
in close as to college, no jostling with each other, discarded or
not acquire the hardiness that this is raised, and were later useful
in their villages, without losing the love country, as would happen
if the bring forth out to learn outside of the province.

In the hospice learn arts and crafts more useful and necessary in these villages, putting skilled
teachers, and which are suited for later distributed in their villages, working perfectly
the works of his powers and could teach others.

The libraries of all people could form a very good school of Candelaria
and leaving in each village those books that priests could serve to
the very exercise of his ministry, send the rest to Buenos Aires so
that there they sold, even at a low price, and amount to buy modern
works that were required for the school library.

It would be good in the capital had a seminar to teach girls all work of their sex, and especially
the government of a house and family, the upbringing and education of children and women for
others, and so to them, as the boys should perfectly instructed in
the Castilian language, forming, for everything and have got due effect,
a good education and putting all the responsibility of a director
which suited.

The rents for these houses should keep out of the profits of all peoples, taking three percent,
and applying the same purpose also the value of the works to be working at the hospice, and the product
of the passage of cattle crossing the Parana Candelaria making it necessary step and removing
the traveling on the other hand, and if the government was some other branch or discretion,
may apply to the same end.

In each village should be sent each year to Candelaria, at least 4 boys and 2 girls always preferring
the sons of chiefs, for them there would be for that each one on purpose or had inclination,
and for every one who send, you should see with one or two dollars
per month, or what should be had by signaling for help food and clothes
for them and them, that everyone should have decently.

Also useful is sought royal permission to found convents in Candelaria could the three religions,
Santo Domingo, San Francisco and Merced, that the religious of them could occupy the chairs of the school
and practice all other matters concerning their school and the salvation
of souls, but to admit to the habit by the little Indians who were
able to do so.

Very convenient thing would be that the capital be established a provincial board, composed the governor,
his advisor, the royal treasury minister, the prosecutor and protector, and if includes some of the
sub-delegation, to take place in it, voting or not, as seemed convenient.

At this meeting and would try everything pertaining to real estate, assets of people and police
of them, giving every part of the junta superior de Buenos Aires, so that, seen there, it is determined
as appropriate.

This meeting presented the factors accounts for its consideration,
and with the advice guard, for tax and the report of the provincial
board, be referred to higher of Buenos Aires for approval.

The Buenos Aires attorneys would be convenient to surrender their accounts every two years, giving
people from those who were dependent, and the factors they would invest in theirs, as industry
dependent on them, or exposing them saying what he pleased, and the
provincial board would examine the factor, and would turn, as already
stated.

All peoples are beaded earrings, even from the time of expatriates and every day more than its
liquidation is impossible without the government can separate hindrance offered when it comes to
fit, and they pave the provincial board all paths and settled on
the best way possible.

The provincial board would fix the costs each year people would have in patron saint festivals,
the days of the King and his birthday, and other solutions; as well as the same ordinary or extraordinary
expenditure of each, giving the way in delivering, spend and give accounts should be observed.

For
the Indians were proclaiming to work on what was most useful to the
province, real treasury and to them, could have the same provincial
board in each of the villages should be brought more awards to apply
and advance in the occupations or more branches useful, as practiced
in Spain in real economic societies of friends the country, getting
these awards from mutual funds, according to the peoples they had,
and giving all part of the upper board for approval.

Arranged in the way that the government of these peoples, it seems
that objects to Governor should direct your care with particular are:

First,
it was necessary to attend to the governor that the Indians were not
missing by factors at all, as it is explained that their wages they
were just paid, which sells the maintenance and other services necessary
to preserve and comfort with greater equity, and that they bought
and how much they wished they had sold their fair prices, making tariffs
for everything so that each year, February or March, when the crops
have been tested and is available to future crops, is publish tariffs
for the following year and the prices at which they had to buy everything
they collect and benefits as those who had to sell, which, being Wholesale
sales, did not exceed the price at which they bought from a fifteen
percent, and less than twenty-five.

And rightly train would address what fruits are more use and need in the province, which is
applied over the Indians and they cost less acquiring job or benefits, which are more trade or
value outside of the towns; and seen it all, and known the advantages, disadvantages, application
or desaplicación by crops previous fix tariffs, giving more value
to the fruits that were applied unless the Indians to their culture,
and are of greatest need or use in trade, and lowering to those who
have abounded and were less necessary, in consultation with the provincial
board for greater accuracy, and giving of all to the top of Buenos
Aires for approval.

Second, take care of the governor that the Indians were not prevented the planting and make
their farms where they liked and accommodating, as practiced now,
therefore, having have used all fields, it is necessary that at least
the early years continue This same practice until the experience makes
them know they need not all have them; So with the money to acquire
their wages, or in other occupations, buy what is necessary others,
and would be detrimental to them if they clog the plantings where
and how they wanted them.

But they would know that, to acquire ownership of the land who holds, and that no one could
deprive them of them were to be submitted to the governor asking intended to occupy the land,
and being provided to its forces, and not being busy with another title, they could dispense conditioned
Title property charging them that within three years he had to take
pot plants, orange, lemons, peaches, cotton, sugar cane and others
that the government may deem advisable, and of not having them at
the end of those three years, could anyone else asking, and you would
be given, but if the plants and had as it should, after three years
would be given title freehold for him, his children and descendants,
and so that he could sell or dispose as best he was, and acquired
ownership of a site could ask the same another way, not be denied.

In the same line and with the same conditions would convenient to distribute land to the Spanish
who settled in villages, which no doubt many people would come to this province, which would
be very useful, as would occupy more than the Indians should give them wages, and they have
nowhere used to taste abound and everything. But neither one nor the other should give them land
to stay, and if needed it could lease the large, comfortable corner there in terms of people,
or consider buying them as more useful, but with the obligation of
home settled in the village where applicable.

Third, the governor would care buildings should be increased and that people make another order
and convenience, directing, with the intervention of the provincial board and approval of the higher
flows that were to be used in building construction new and repairing existing ones, and that the
latter were allowed to Indians live for nothing, at least in the first five years. Let them
know that, after these, had to pay rent, and those who occupy the houses be built again, were
Indian or Spanish, to pay annual or monthly rentals are tasase; and those who would build their
own houses, they franquearía the sun for nothing.

Fourth, the governor should take care in the years that were not missing a sterile Indians to
keep him occupied, at least to win for eating and dressing. On these occasions factors would
apply it to cut timber in the mountains, or they buy which they had cut and carved, and that
those for the herb benefits in the mountains, to the cattle and other occupations that the province
offers even in years more sterile, and if even that was not enough, that mutual funds be used more
the ordinary to use it in composition of roads, building bridges, fountains and regadizos ditches
and other public works that the step they took occupation and wages to increase the comfort Indians
in the province and the usefulness of all, and thus never missing work or what the natives eat,
assuming that the factory no lack of spare parts for these occasions.

The fifth and last, take care of the governor in the villages were rebuilt house Mercy was in time
of the Jesuits, and that it would be collected all the old, old, poor and disabled that had
no staying, or who voluntarily wished collected there, as well as those who did not have how to
heal sick, and that all these them from attending the assets of the factory, and that those who could
work on something were applied to what they could do to benefit from the same factory, so there
was no in no needy people.
