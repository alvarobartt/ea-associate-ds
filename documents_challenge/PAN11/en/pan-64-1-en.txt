 Who learn these bad habits? Why do not you tell me where?

- And Nemesia, the daughter of breast Pepper musician, is not being
on the street until ten o'clock?

Last night nothing less stumbled on the square of Christ lunita playing with a lot of guys.

- And do you want to compare with the daughter of breast Pimienta, a shabby Pardito, street, and
poor maid? When you least expect to bring that spirit-home on a table with the head split into
two pieces. The goat, daughter, always changes its spots. You are better born than she. Your
father is a white knight, and some day you must be rich and carriage ride. Who knows? Nemesia but
will never be more than what it is. Get married, if married, with a mulatto like her because his
father has more black than anything else. You, on the contrary, you can almost white aspire
to marry a white. Why not? God made us less. And you should know that white though poor, is for
husband, black or mulatto and the ox of gold. I speak from experience ... As I was married twice
... Do not remember things past. If you knew what happened a little girl, near your age, for
ignoring the advice of his grandmother, which predicted that if he
was to walk the streets late at night was going to happen very unfortunate
...

- Tell me about it, tell me, Chepilla repeated the girl with
such curiosity.

- Well, sir, a very dark night, the wind was blowing
strong, certainly was a day St. Bartholomew, which, as I've said before,
you release the devil from the three pm, Narcisa was the girl that
it was his name, sat singing softly in the stone doorway of his house
while his grandmother prayed cornered behind the window ... I remember
like it was now.

Well, sir, had touched souls in the Holy Spirit and the wind was
off the few lights, the streets were very dark, quiet and lonely,
as pitch.

Well as I was saying, the girl singing and the old praying the rosary, when being so, cate
you hear a violin playing there in return Angel. What is included the Narcisa? That was a thing
of dancing, and without asking her grandmother, oste unsaid or moste, he ran and never stopped
until the hill. So the old finished praying, believing that his granddaughter was in bed, as
was natural, closed the door.

- And on the street left the poor girl? Cecilia interrupted the counting samples of anxiety
and pity.

- Now you'll see. The old lady, before bed, because it was late and fell sleep, took a candle and
went to the cot to see if her granddaughter was sleeping.

Imagine what it would not stay that loved her so much, to find the bed empty. He ran to the front
door, opened it, shouted to her granddaughter: Narcisa!

Narcisa! But Narcisa not responding. Already seen, how he to answer the unhappy if the devil had
taken?

- How was that? embarrassed the girl asked.

- I'll tell you, Hump sign calmly continued, noting that it had the
desired effect his fairy stories.

Well, sir, Narcisa reaching the five corners of the Angel, he appeared a very handsome young
man who asked him where he was going at that hour of the night .-- A view a dance, "replied
the innocent .-- I'll take you," replied the young man and taking her by the arm took her to
the wall. Although it was very dark, Narcisa noticed that as they walk the unknown was put
tight, very tight, such as coal, that the hairs on your head as you straighten Lesnar, that the sizes
teeth sticking out laughing as pig boar, who was born two horns on their foreheads, who dragged
a furry tail on the ground, come on, it got heated by mouth as a bread oven. Narcisa then
screamed in horror and tried to escape, but the figure brown dug her nails into her throat when
she screamed, and loading with her, he climbed the tower of the Angel, who, as you've noticed,
has no cross, and from there threw in a very profound hole that opened and closed again swallowing
it in an instant. Well, that is, daughter, what happens to girls who do not heed the advice
of their elders.

Given here in order to sign his story and began Chepa admiration, fear of Cecilia, which he trembled
from head to toe and give teeth chattering, but constantly yawning, because most was the dream
that the fear with which, stumbling, he went to bed, which is what throw the wily old. Many
other stories like that did to the girl wandering; but we are sure that no other fruit brought
with them to fill your head with superstitions and daunted his spirit. That is not why he left
the girl to your liking, escaping sometimes through the window, taking advantage of the time
other than sent to the tavern immediate corner to beating from street to street and from square
to square, when after the incentive of a dance music, when the drums after the handover, when
the carriages the funeral, when, finally, the bog schoolboy who snatches the silver through baptism.

     Bring thought Full of
     impudence, and spill In clumsy thousand
     raucous voices That infects the wind

     they love.

         

GONZALEZ CARVAJAL

Five or six years after the time of which we have undertaken in the previous two chapters, at the end
of September, had first the convent of the Merced to the series of trade fairs that until the
year 1832, used to solemnize the main events in Cuba religious dedicated to the patron saints
of the churches and convents sometimes overlapping novenarios with
circular Sacramento, introduced the cult of Cuba since the early years
of century by Bishop Espada y Landa.

The Novena, by the way say, nine days before the date on which the saint fell employer and lasted until
nine, which was completed two ninths row. Is said eighteen holidays, religious and secular,
who had more than grotesque and irreverent that devout and edifying.

At that time it was said High Mass with morning sermon and save raw singing night inside the
church with a procession through the streets of the holy day.

Outside the temple there was what was meant by fair in Cuba, which reduced the accumulation in
the plaza or in the neighboring streets, countless stalls, consistent on a table or board scissors,
covered with an awning and lighted by one or more lamps to burn fat, where it was sold, not
indeed any article of trade or commerce country or product of the
soil, hunting, bird or livestock, but only very low level trinkets
of value, jams of various kinds, cakes, play dough, hazelnuts, icing,
water and punch Loja milk.

That was not fair in the direct sense of the word.

But this was certainly not the most remarkable feature of our holiday pie. Had in show something that
was notable for too rude and insolent. We now incur at stake games and hands that were part of the
show and that caused his stupendous while lying profits, greed for the unwary. Directed and
implemented the most black men and the worst kind. While crude artifice, trick did not stop
many who considered themselves very astute. These took place in the plaza or in the street,
the dim light of candles or lanterns, and people taking part in them of all kinds, conditions,
ages and sexes. For high social position, we mean for whites, there was something more decent,
had the house of dance, where a Farruco, a Brito a Illas or Marqués de Casa Calvo had placed the
bench or play from the dark forest until after midnight, while lasted
eighteen days of the fair.

We tried the house or houses as they were dancing neighbor to the parish could or convent where
the novena is held. In the room we danced, played in the dining room orchestra, and in the
yard playing a game known as the Mt. The table was long and narrow that would fit most of
the players sitting on either side, the dealer to a head and the other his assistant who say
gurrupié. For the protection of players and cards, in case of rain, frequent in the fall, an
awning was stretched from the eaves of the house the bridge of the dividing wall of the neighbor.
Not all gamblers, to our shame be said, were the stronger sex, older, or the class willing,
in the crowded group and demanding of those who risked the fate of a letter, perhaps the support
of his family the next day, or the honor of the wife, daughter or sister, could lie to see busiest
lady who gamble their own decency, or still beardless boy or a friar mercenary serge habits straw
color, with wide-brimmed hat pulled down, the accounts of the long string between the thumb
and forefinger of his left hand and right employed to place the gold or silver coin at the point
that the more he, losing or gaining always with the same serenity
of mind to face.

The banker, to call by name more decent, was who was spending the rent house, the music and
the sperm candles lit the room to dance dining and game table. All this was done to attract players.
The input of course, was free, although the bastonero, who also threw salary, did not admit
any kind person. At that time ran very strong currency, the hard Spanish and ounces gold. The silver
often small, and it was something to hear the tinkle of pesos to continuous columnar and sound
ounces, the gamblers dropped mechanically from one hand to another or on the table to distract
the mind and somehow break the solemn silence of random game.

That nothing here is drawn in broad strokes was banned or not more than tolerated by constituted
authorities, it is clear from the fact that the gambling dens in Cuba paid a contribution to
the government for alleged objects of charity. What else? Advertising that ride was played
all over the island especially during the last period the Captain General Don Francisco Dionisio
Vives, announced, to leave no doubt that his policy or his government was based on the Machiavellian
principle of purchase for master, copying the other famous Roman
statesman: divide et impera.

Because equivalent to break the mood, the corrupt, which is not the people saw their own misery
and degradation.

But this digression, however necessary it might be, we have deviated somewhat from the target point
of this history. Drew our attention to an entire class dance floor which flourished in the precincts
of the city by the side facing south. The house where he had indeed offered mean appearance,
not by its facade down and dirty as the place where he was, which was none other than the gated San
Jose, opposite the wall on a street honda and stony. Although wide door with flap, was not what
was meant in Cuba hallway, then right to the room opened. After this came the room with the
corresponding tinajero, pyramidal cedar frame, which often locked shutters stone filter, the
jar red-bellied, the vases, a kind of terra cotta and pale alcarrazas of Valencia, Spain.
The dining room that was the side door of the first room, busy mostly by two orders of red
cowhide chairs, a bed with hangings white muslin and a cabinet, which said in Havana window.
Other rooms were to that, crowded with ordinary furniture, and parallel to them a long, narrow courtyard,
also blocked in part by the high parapet of a well whose waters brackish
with the adjoining house divided, finished patio rooms and a parlor
crossed and free.

The latter was a regular size table, dressed and prepared with utensils and for up to ten people,
some soft drinks and delicacies, Loja water, lemonade, wine candy, jams Cake, covered, sighing,
meringues, a ham decorated with loops ribbons and confetti, and a large fish swimming about
in a thick sauce of strong seasoning. In the room there were many ordinary wooden chairs placed
along the walls, and right as one enters from the street, a couch, with several stands up
straight ahead. He, at the time that our story begins, he occupied up to seven black and mulatto
musicians three violins, a bass, a flute, a pair of drums and a clarinet. The last instruments
mentioned herein was conducted by a young mulatto, well built and
not evil like face, who, despite his few years, led the little band.

This was seen standing at the head of the couch on the side of the street. His colleagues, almost
all older than him, Pepper said, and it was a nickname, and his true
surname, he appointed from now on.

His gaze distracted and even gloomy, never left the front door, as if expecting something
or someone, just when we speak now.

But that door, as well as square frame window, looked besieged a crowd of onlookers of all ages and
conditions, which only allowed access to the room women and men with right or desire to enter.
And we will, because rightly or had no ballot, nor did bastonero you receive or settle. The dance,
knowingly was one of those who, without knowing its origin, called cradle in Havana. We only
know that were given fair time, which they had free entry of individuals of both sexes color class,
but he also refuses to honor young white men who used with their presence. The fact, however,
be prepared inside a good drink, test if this was a crib in the broad sense of the word, at least
part of the attendance at the invitation had been received or expected to be well received.
This was in fact truth. The mistress of the house, rich and lavish mulatto, named Mercedes, was celebrating
his saint union of their particular friends, and opened the doors
to enjoy the dance fans this fun and contribute their presence to
more luster and interest of the meeting.

Eight o'clock at night. From the afternoon had been dropping the first rainy autumn, and although
they had stopped at dusk, having soaked the ground, leaving the streets impassable, they had
cooled the atmosphere. Far from it, had been so saturated with moisture, which adhered to the skin
and boiled in the pores. But these were not inconvenience for the curious, as we said before,
besieged the door and window, to fill almost half of the narrow, crooked street, or for those
attending the dance, that as the night wore on arriving in greater numbers, some on foot, others
in carriages. Nine kinds of the dance floor was swarming with human heads, the women sitting
in chairs around and the men standing in the middle, forming a compact group, all hats on,
so head sticking out, surely encountered with glass pump, suspended from a beam of three chains
of copper, the only burning sperm candle to illuminate half as strange
as that heterogeneous crowd.

Fairly was the number of black and mulatto who had entered, mostly dressed outlandishly. The
men of the same class, whose attendance exceeded that of women not dressed better taste, but almost
everyone wore cloth coat and vest of pique, the less Sucks canvas, denim or Arabia, which is then
generally used, and cloth hat. There was no shortage not young Creole decent and affluent families,
which shamelessly rubbed with people of color and fun taking part in their most characteristic,
some by mere hobby and others moved by motives less pure origin. It appears that some of them,
few indeed did not attempt the women of her class, if we are to judge by the disengage with which
stopped in the ballroom and spoke to his acquaintances or friends,
to science and presence of those who, silent spectators, they saw
from the window of the house.

of face and forms as for his jovial ways, one to whom his colleagues
