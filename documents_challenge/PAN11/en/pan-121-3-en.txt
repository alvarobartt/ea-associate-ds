 Most of the days were reduced to happen next eating in front
of the house of a wealthy merchant, to go to the casino. Cecilia used to be sewing behind glass.
His hat, smile, go ahead, then the pool, and even another day. Don Melchor was charged twice more
errands for Don Rosendo, but had the good lucky to find him always in the office. We say good
luck, because Gonzalo trembled before the idea of ??going up to the house and tripped over Cecilia.

Had
already served twenty years.

The idea of ??becoming an industrial engineer and engaging in something useful, occasionally
returning to his spirit in the midst of lazy life. Comrade which turned from a military academy,
the conversation with a British engineer, the phrase of contempt in the casino I heard about
that had no career, despertábanle Suddenly the desire. Finally, one day he told his uncle
that if he gave permission was going to England to study something and see the world. As Don Melchor
nothing could be opposed to this just and laudable purpose, Gonzalo ran a few days after the houses
of relatives and friends, where for years that not set foot, to say goodbye, and a peaceful and
beautiful late spring embarked Watch round the brig bound for Britain.

Do you remember Cecilia? We do not know. In temperaments like our youth, fire of the passions
takes time to turn, although in the end cause havoc.

Three years passed. He finished the race engineer who is short and practice in England and was
determined to visit the main factories in this country and France and Germany. In the studying long
lasting memory of Cecilia asaltábale from time to time, without cause, of course, very lively
emotion. Back in the spring when the blood flows more strongly veins and Mother Nature with
the green of the fields, the vivid colors flowers, the play of light, warm balmy air, and above all,
through their interpreters loyal, birds, invites us to consent in any way that the human species
extinguished, Gonzalo thought of marriage. And if this idea arose in his mind, presentábasele suddenly
made flesh in the first child of the lords of Belinchón: - "Come in, Gonzalo; Dad is waiting. ""
Do you hurt? "- was played again in his ears the words and affectionate tone with which they
were delivered up in their heart a spark of virgin sympathy. The girl was not beautiful, but
her eyes do, especially in her appeal revelábase sex in the air modest and simple, the tone of voice,
exquisite delicacy, entirely female manners. "I hate to marry her" thought with a sigh; because he
judged it impossible to dare to tell it not to miss any single word love. Until then I did not know
of such passion that the appearance and coarse material, the fleeting relationships, and sad
that women forced by night in the streets of London and Paris.

One day writing a close friend of Sarrió came up asking if Cecilia
Belinchón had married.

Then said it was still single and that if it was true that some the haunted suitors enticed perhaps
by the money rather than Belinchón thank your daughter, until now no one knew who had given
ear to anyone. As you read this, you raised the blood to the face to the industrial engineer.
He had the conceit to think (to be exempted by God) Cecilia rejected the suitors in your hand
... because none was so handsome as him. Then imagine declare his love letter. Being so far
away would not shame. However, had it, and when he tried to take the pen to do so, before drawing
the first line, turned to leave when they represented the surprise that the young receive. It
was a few days. The idea never left him. By a thousand subtle reasoning tried to persuade
to write the love letter. If you laughed at him, what? did not see him. With never to return
to Sarriówas concluded, and if she would try and find it not front. At last he wrote. Took hold of
it stored in his desk drawer for several days. The idea of send it off was terrified. To decide
this, needed to drink a few glasses of rum. When he was a little dizzy took the letter from
the drawer, threw himself into the streets with verve, and mailbox first encountered your
eyes, zap! the fit.

My God, what have I done! Vanished as drunkenness.

Flushed to the ears, as if through the hole in that box you're looking at the mocking eyes
of all neighbors Sarrió, and hastened to put your fingers on it to see if it could catch the
ill-fated envelope. Nothing. It had been engulfed with the voracity of a shark, and I was
already digested. Then occurred to be in the post office and claim it, but there demanded such
formalities, before passing them preferred to let fortune.

He spent eight days in great distress. When the cards are dealt at the inn, he felt an anxiety
that stifled him, expecting to reach the packet enclosed in a huge, ugly pumpkins, just punishment
and its too much bullshit. Passed, however, eight days and even fifteen, and the answer did
not appear. It was calming with the vague hope that the letter had not reached its destination.
If reached, the illusion that forjábase Cecilia would have broken without informing anyone. But
behold, when I did not expect, is at lunchtime on the plate a letter from Spain, female unknown
letter. Is unrepresentable the anguish which assailed him. She got as white as the tablecloth. The heart
wanted saltársele chest. Opened it with trembling hands ... Ahaa! sighed rested, after having
eaten in two seconds. She took his hand to his chest, limpióse sweat with a handkerchief, and
resumed the letter and reread it in stride.

It was, in fact, Cecilia, and was written in a gently ironic tone, that had nothing, however,
offensive. Manifestábase surprised at his sudden and unexpected return. What fly had stung after
four years of absence? His parents, who before her had opened the letter, were equally surprised,
thought it was a step thoughtless own a few years, a whim of the moment, which probably would already
be sorry. She shared this view entirely. However, had permitted and even recommended to answer, because
it is a young villager, whose family maintained relations friendship.

This letter will soon put thrilled.

No pumpkins were dismissive expected. Then he grew sad and happy the minute again, reading and
rereading it to see if it gave in the key. Were or were not pumpkins? Hastened to reply, apologizing
for his boldness, and confirmed its previous statement with new and vehement phrases. He replied after
some days the child in a more soft and affectionate. Turned to writing Gonzalo; cruzáronse portraits
Dona Paula intervened. In short, after a short time, were two young men in relation formal. He began
to talk of marriage between Don Melchor half letter and his nephew, then visits between the former
and Don Rosendo. Finally everything was settled, agreeing that the Gonzalo return spring, and he
performed the marriage.

THE COUPLE IN LOVE BEGINS TO THINK IN THE NEST

Out of the theater
and those who remained.

Gonzalo stumbled upon the wave of people who vomited the door, and
as was recognized, were quick to surround you and greet old friends.

The first threw her arms around his neck was Don Mateo, then came Don Pedro Miranda Parakeet
child, then Mayor Roque after Victoriano and his wife Dona Rosario and his three daughters. In an
instant circle was formed around the young, who rushed to respond warmly to the congratulations,
hugs and handshakes that all sites will came. The sailors, the village women took part in those
manifestations of affection as well as the gentlemen. Nothing was heard but exclamations of wonder
and joy.

- How have you gained weight, Gonzalito .-- What a real boy! - Why
do not you grow like him, parakeet? - Don Gonzalo, soups do you eat
them in the head at all .-- Growing Sarrió porters has grown what
he has done is to double the body .-- Come, grenadier, give me a tight
hug.

A skipper said it seemed like a drop of water to another Prince of
Wales.

Gonzalo was perhaps a little higher.

The hulk of this robust, towered over the group. Clasped hands above their heads friends who could
not reached him, and his noble and kindly face smiling at everyone.

Don Mateo, rising on the toes and swinging the arm to bend, could
say in his ear:

- What role have you lost, Gonzalo!

Too bad you did not come in the afternoon. The treble sang like an angel ... And dancing! ...
The dance I say, boy, that neither in the Coruña Bilbao or better take it out ... But be not wroth,
and I will repeat before he leaves the company ... or have little power.

But Gonzalez did not attend. Staring at the door, waiting for the restless and eager output
Belinchón family, who as principal and the most haughty, was delayed always not to be confused
with the populace. In order to light the lantern burning on the framework the door, he saw the
face of Dona Paula and then that of Cecilia. Tremulous Abalanzóse to greet them. The daughter
blushed like a turkey (of course), and the mother too (this is less natural). What had to
do to him? Blush also, and this was what led out in a perfect way. Three were trembling voice,
and after asking for health, did not know what to say. Loaded glances of curious people contributed
in pregnant women. Pablito happily came to Ventura, who had left behind, and our young greeted
warmly and directed first to the second one ceremonial pitch.

Paul smiled.

- What, do you not know? Ventura is my sister.

- Oh! How could he know? She is a woman ... How are you, Ventura?

The girl reached for him with a malicious and mocking speech that you just embarrass you.

They stood up to the house. Venturita ran ahead dragging his brother. Marched behind Dona Paula,
Cecilia, Gonzalo. Rosendo brought up the rear with his good friend Pedro Miranda. The streets
were dark. Only those hours burning lanterns corner. The distance between the three groups
was becoming larger.

Gonzalo began making desperate efforts to hold the conversation with your future wife and mother,
but it is not opened his mouth, dominated, no doubt, shame, and Dona Paula walked very far from
being a Madame de Stael. Nor had helped him Conversation Dictionary, the result was that it did not
prosper. By letters had come to trust. Dona Paula often put postscripts in Cecilia. Gonzalo replied
with a wisecrack, ordered prints, caricatures for Ventura, and carried around as a member of the
family. But now the three experienced discomfort embarrassing. Our young in his life he had
spoken with Mrs. Belinchón, and Cecilia had only crossed the words
we said.

Then, up ahead, Venturita laughed out loud with his brother, and boyfriends reasonably presumed
that they were on the table. However, when approached, home, the conversation was taking heat
and had some symptoms to believe that soon would king's confidence.

Formosa group to the door of the house of lords Belinchón, which was located in la Rúa Nueva,
the main street Sarrió, and was large and sumptuous for which there stylish. As Gonzalo had
not eaten yet, Rosendo invited him up to do with them so true, and with words so pressing that
the young man who wanted nothing, he concluded to accept. They took leave Mr. Miranda and his son
Parakeet, and the family Belinchón with the new guy was going to be part of it, went to the house.
At the reception, the ladies took off their coats and shawls. The light returned to upsetting them.
Gonzalo could well then see his girlfriend, and noted that he had not won anything in years
of absence. Was higher, but also thinner. The love does not get fat girls. The nose, with this,
had been even more pronounced. Only those beautiful eyes, smooth, intelligent, persisted to shine
like two stars. The transformation of Venturita girl who looked cross for school, clinging
to the maid to keep jumping over him attracted wide attention. She was a woman, a real woman,
not so much height, as roundness and breadth of forms, for the singular
strength of his vision and Malicious certain glow that accompanied it.

Examináronse both as two strangers in a quick glance.

Gonzalo said under his breath at Dona Paula:

- What a change the Venturita!

It's a beautiful girl.

For lower than what the girl said she heard it. Became serious with involvement, made a slight
grimace of contempt with their lips, and went right to the dining room, hiding the pleasant tingling
that this compliment had caused so spontaneous.

The table was set: a table patriarchal province, abundant, clean, without flowers or the other
elegant refinements that civilization is introduced. And to approach it, Gonzalo's pregnancy was
missing. It seemed that yesterday I had dinner there too. A gust blew joy to everyone. Cambiáronse
words and laughter. Gonzalo embraced Pablito and asked for their
horses. Dona Paula managed the distribution of silverware.

Venturita sitting and, downed olives, tossing the bones to his sister
and making provocative winks, while she, with flushed cheeks and bright
eyes, put her finger to lips asking for discretion.

Don Rosendo had gone to put on your gown and cap, without which it
would have hurt dinner.

His wife invited the young stranger to sit in the neighbor set that
of Cecilia.

But it had happened at the other end of the table, and there was about to sit.

- What are you doing, girl? Why do not you come to your site? - Dona Paula asked with surprise.

The
young man stood up without reply, blushed, and sat down next to her boyfriend.

The classic soup steamed with eggs and butter in the center of the table.

- Look, do dish Gonzalo ... Already beginning to serve you - you said after smiling kindly as
a woman who professed similar ideas to those expressed by St. Paul
in his famous letter.

Cecilia hurried to obey, filling the bowl of his future.

This had usually an excellent appetite, appropriate to his great
humanity. Now, over-excited by the air sea ??and a few hours of fasting,
was voracious. Ate without leaving crumbs without any timidity, the
placed before him, and that Cecilia, as may be supposed, had no short-hand
to help you. When she began to eat, lost Gonzalo shame. The urgent
need for your body gigantea was essential. In contrast, Cecilia barely
touched on the food. Displaying on your plate two bits of ham the
size of two walnuts, and asked the young man

- Who do you make this
dish, for the parrot?

- No, it's for me.

- Are not you afraid that
you indigestion?

It was the first joke authorizing its future
