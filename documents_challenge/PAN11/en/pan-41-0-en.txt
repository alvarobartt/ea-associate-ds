 

If you incur these principles to our state and population, to observe the progress of these maximum,
we amaze our lazy inaction and neglect our offense, much more remarkable a century to this part,
for failing to cast a glance over the conduct of nations cultured in the same hemisphere. It is true
that in all states and all peoples ages, has been orators against such vices, but is unfortunately
have been less, and the most neglected, and perhaps persecuted, and more if the measures of
a healthy moral and maximum philanthropic, were in inverse ratio to the interests of some, the ambition
of glory in others, and the rude and stupid ignorance, especially those who believe they AD
refused to everything but his biggest hit.

It is equally true that large companies usually have been attacked by ambition of inexperienced,
greedy and envious, destroying them by means specious entrepreneurs, and spreading erroneous opinions,
unsupported to support them. But yet to be abundant these common agents, enervating, cripple
and retard such works, is certainly note, and space for almost a century of disputes, could
not unroll the advancement of our borders, living and tenaciously urged by the Excellent.
Cabildo, chiefs and corporations all of this capital, where none have stopped taking part.

Nothing proves more our dwindling interest in the advancement of the country, all our shortage
shame and ignorance, and nothing in the end our indolence towards our true interest and subsistence,
apathy just referred. Anyone, interested in the general good want to impose the truth with which we
can appropriate degrading those attributes, be convinced to develop the chapter records only, representations,
reports, certificates the Treasury issued frankly, scientific surveys, statements, details, backgrounds
dressings and as deemed necessary, in order to find a wealth of documents, giving first in the
year 1741 of the previous century, continued for 45, 52, 53, 60, 68, 72, 74, 77, 84, 94, 96, 804,
810, and without interruption. Today we are no doubt less proportion than ever for execution,
but apparently in most moods, according to the charitable view of Government. However, until
now our merchants have had the quality of rooted and could not ignore their roots grow both as
progress in the province establishments, and could not look with indifference their existence,
especially since the year 1777, which was extended to this part of American commerce, and cut
the embarrassing ties that had bound shipments to any of the Peninsula, and already deployed
more proportionate to the regeneration of towns, agriculture and industry.

It seems indeed that an evil genius, and destroyer of our common happiness,
always precedes to block the roads so much to pave seeks, in order
not to be precarious the other mainland provinces and kingdoms in
all kinds of strange fruits, and other wealth we have in our soil,
and finally to deprive us of that through people to be made, we are
unique, because nature so ordained, gracing the point our position
with privilege to all other known balloon.

Is the more remarkable apathy on the advancement of frontiers, as they do not deal today more land
than those who possessed it, and concluded with the Indians, and Vera Head D. Juan de Garay with
60 soldiers and 30 families, while the city of Buenos restored Aires in 1580, to wit: 35 miles
NS, partly at least, listed the river Paraná Salado, and EO 120,
to enter the jurisdiction of Córdoba.

In direct ratio to the progression of those people said it's time soon need for new extensions,
but unfortunately have been neglected the cries of farmers and farmers, who narrowed the need,
have been compelled to be established between the same tribes of
Indians, to the southern part of Salt, to live at the mercy of them,
very his risk, and where every moment they are attacked and robbed.

Our livelihoods and meat supply, service of oxen, horses and mules, and finally our crops and
plantations, are branches that are mostly arbitrary pending of those enemies, and our defense
to its devastating and ongoing missions, is so urgent and necessary,
and puts those enemies in a massive respect.

Anyone that service experience, or because watchful eye on the occurrences This ground has seen
or have heard, however superficial, of the pathetic scenes that have
blood stained the campaigns of helpless victims, killed by the ferocity
of this enemy, so in time of peace known as the open war, defy the
indolence that our ancestors have left to run forever without applying
appropriate remedy to so serious evils, simply indicates only where
the bloody raids repeated, but such signs were causing other effects
applied to caustics Sick, removing both the dying any sleepy, finally
killed the evil dies and caustic or by his ineffectiveness.

The Supreme Government would now put an end to these tragedies, not to leave to future generations
a sad memory, as we now do to those who have preceded him. Search careful way they can make effective
as interesting works, encourages to citizens who can provide ideas provided according to their
knowledge, and truth, these, whom the Lord no less than interested in the happiness Governor
of the province can not without injustice refuse to so beneficial cooperation of view. And
for this reason I find myself in the case of my short target knowledge, that a contraction assiduous
this point in more than six years, who by the Lord Governor, has
been minister.

Do not remember the aforementioned scenes, nor cruel times we saw invasions bury the bodies
by hundreds, if not his memory afflict widows and orphans who still mourn their misery by these
unfortunate occurrences, and because I better take a veil over all and convinced them just where
we need to repair which threaten us again, and go to put them respect the Indians friendly,
and so insurance to their animosity, grading operations, according surtieren means that this
taken, in the absence of an imposing force and that could be available
to fix our lines in a way inaccessible to the enemy.

Two extremes (in my opinion irreconcilable), I have seen usually take the achievement of this
company. The first, the awesome force, to destroy and annihilate their extermination to these
Indians, it is not easy in a long time and the second, a mediator of friendship opposition of
minds, for reciprocal treatment that will soften, with the interest of some of our trade items
they crave too.

The first half agree that the lesson, and has for some time, until remake to tackle with more excitement,
stalking the most advantageous times to do so. His fierce and vindictive nature, causes never
forgive the insult, and not to forget, in Occurrence and parliaments all relate those events
with tears and renewed duels, and go to his children and descendants of the more serious charge of
their vengeance, which last both as aggressors aggrieved families.

The second, which is friendship, which enables them to retreat to his awnings steal with impunity,
as they do all they can cover their forces, and noiseless sweep us daily fields, reducing our cattle
and fields of salted peanuts appalling: no that it no longer met at different times of the year
several tribes to make substantial theft, eyeing before rodeos to
be assaulted, partners, or perhaps driven by our gauchos defectors
deserters.

This not only ruined our stay, but with a view to get rid of us all sorts of cattle, without having check
these facts need another observation, that those with collections tithes, either by a five-year
period, or comparing the last year by the former.

It is very painful thing to see many of our farmers disclosed three to four years, expend massive
flows to establish a herd of 10, 15 or 20 thousand head of cattle, and when on the night of
his meditated reward their labors rest, arranging the sale of livestock, woke up without a single
cow, habérsela stolen by Indians. D. Pedro Perez, D. Mariano Veliera, D. Agustin Garcia and others,
with almost all border on the line, can testify the truth of these facts.

Do not be too sure, that which makes it the boundary line exceeding annual thefts than 40,000
cattle, and perhaps equal or greater number of horses, mares and mules, without sufficient to contain
the Government's counterclaims, and its repeated offers good friendship, for being so lengthy fields,
as their populations in small tribes, evade easily by ensuring that those of S are those of
O, and these to those.

And indeed that have a perfect alternative to the robberies, making them an active trade seasonal
selling and interchangeable in their amounts to the Araucanian Indians bordering the Andes, whose
greed overwhelming rush our ruin, if not actively repaired.

Our compatriots who are familiar with them to escape punishment for their crimes sometimes serve
as a guide, and other real drivers, to whom not only protect Indians, but to defend their people by
force, if sometimes persecuted benefiting from their tents, as has been repeatedly and I have
experienced.

Six years of uninterrupted treatment with these infidels, having first gone carefully by their
more inland areas to the center of its greater number of ranch, and even with this reason
able to attract to the party and therefore friendly to the principal
chiefs, I have identified their locations, and less mistake made known
as they are in their false tenders, the cunning double deal with that
present themselves, always assuming representations who have not,
and offers that can never meet or have a view.

It is therefore necessary to bear in mind that every family is a patriarchy, and independent look
of others, and thus to fly home or awnings, their cattle and children are transposed from
one to another point on this continent, or westward of the range, if its excesses fear of being
attacked by us or by their own neighbors.

The chieftainship usually between this kind of Indian blood is not as strongly as Araucanians
observe their ancestors: it is by choice, and only for cases of war and parliaments, and out
of this does not hold any regard or respect for, and their quarrels
out so broken pate the chiefs as the others, if they have no chance
to defend himself with skill, that in such cases and result is when
is credited to be elevated to chiefs.

But they recognize however, with respectful submission to the callers ulmenes, governors or
chiefs, of which class there are only two in the large space of land which is from the west
coast of Black River, eastern slopes of the Cordillera de los Andes, Cordoba and Cuyo borders
until Salado ours. One of these commands in the part of O, boundaries of Cuyo, Cordoba and mountains
their understanding from the mountains to the Black River, and on the shores of the sea to our establishments.
I've tried them both, the first in the center of the land of his government, and the second by
this, and sent emissaries to him to happen to a parliament.

When these ulmenes displayed in large gatherings of Indian chiefs and subordinates preceded by several
Indian musicians who play a very mournful flutes, horns, and arcs of strings wound with others to
fashion using blacks, and his rear have made slaves of all sorts in their wars. All come in proportion
to celebrate his ulmen, and seen off the blankets and jargon, leaving
bare, for gifts to Governor excuse not to receive them: and this,
that is regularly provided with good lungs, makes frequent speeches
are always directed to instill spirit against his enemies, holding
them always less.

Then the chiefs appear subordinate to his presence, give as the last time you have seen and met
happened to their families, recommended revenge their misfortunes, and if the reunion is 30
to 40, who has been greeting word after ulmen of them all, referring to them as well, for so the
same thing is repeated many times how many of the attendees, and the replies, and thus, in the absence
of writing, transmitted to posterity by expression news or misfortune to others, to always live
in the memory of future generations of events, referring to the way the Inca Garcilaso de la
Vega, they did their elders.

Having far less than the Excellent. Governor of the previous occurrences, and convinced invalidity
of subordinate chiefs offerings, while being present at ulmenes their proposals, try to attract
these through emissaries who were sent to him through me, and could only be achieved by the appearance
of that of O, that I had tried in the center of his government, which was filed with other chiefs
his subordinates to the Superior Government who of course at the conference I attended, there was
far from assenting to the request for the establishment of new populations with enough sincerity.
Then addressed the word to the other chiefs, and they responded,
that at presence of the provisions of their leader, nothing remained
but that obey.

But the chief governor added that it considered it appropriate to form a parliament, to arise,
the chief governor of the south, settled in the chapters of peace, friendship and populations
that had been decided, which would go away as mutual distrust. For this I was asked by the Superior
procure the means to make them understand the wishes that encouraged them to engage SE more
intimate friendship with the chief ulmen, and to the mate way lends itself to come and personally
receive the safest evidence her sincerity.

Indeed, immediately tried to make him understand by the chiefs and Quinteleu Quidulef, friends,
and I also had proven to be as mine, and the response of the ulmen, sending his two older brothers,
was, to be provided with equal frankness that the elderly, and blind, was not allowed to mount
his horse, but nevertheless encourage to do so, and the road from me, because he wanted the friendship
of which she provided, making According to him, which until then had considered the complaint
of having been in a very short price.

Superiority, who heard the brothers sent the chief, without losing
sight of these occurrences, I came as soon as possible, seek to remedy
the ills afflicting the campaign seeking a term Shortages reconciled
with the treasury, the necessary assistance to the establishment of
the first points of safety, for which approved the draft I submitted
to the order, on February 15, 1814, which could be ordered to make
progress in April 1815 and ceased to have effect on subsequent occurrences,
which are well known and even harmful the state.

The first step of this exhibition was to be, to form the Indian parliament, as indicated, Chapters
settling mutual friendship and more solemn treatment, putting an end to thefts and devastation,
as often required, and identify specific points of entry and exit to the Indians with their fruits
and spices they wanted to introduce into the capital, escorted. That would make people not only
in points that suit both contracting for which should first be recognized
from the Rio Colorado to our borders, fearing Parages several invasion
coast, which to them was much, or more harmful to us in such circumstances:
on the principles of which the negotiation was fed forward, in confidence
with the chiefs in exchange for their interest.

So, the skill in the relationship and openness in the deal would facilitate the recognition, observing the
way, distances, latitudes and longitudes to that point, and those who were provided to populations,
in order not to adventure, as usually happens, for neatly anticipate no accurate survey or less
apparent qualities, and also because more advanced in our villages south should have one spare,
to cover any significant fields, and certainly ought to establish
a strong and population at the bottom of the first sierra, besides
serving as a first point of support military road, was warehouse the
following provisions for the continuation of this work, and meanwhile
the complement of the four companies that were to be detailed force,
put in appropriate discipline, and provision of horses from their
properties, with everything else relative to impose respect necessary,
and on depressed, if necessary, their animosity to look at the confluence
of the Rio Colorado.

Formed this military and defensive line with four companies to 125 male veterans, strong enough
to bring respect to the enemy, be achieved safely (having surveillance) put as many people
who favor the goodness of their land and export its fruits, which may be at different points,
or subordinate to quickly alternate first order, and special classes for aventajaría to themselves
that they would do progress.

This line on the left side of the box forming irregular land, is looking
W, and is very much at its scope to the Indians of that department,
if they make inroads, to cut off their retreat, and live very careful
if you are exceeded.

Population fixed on the Rio Colorado, nothing is more interesting than the recognition of this
river to its source, and considering whether the large flow of the receiving waters of Rio Diamond
or of Neuquen, as generally assumed, and either one of them or both, is military line that can
be extended to the Fort of San Rafael in Mendoza, where the first; and being the second, but is
in proportion to intern more Penco, since traveler after turning away from calling Moylin 70
leagues southwest of the Laguna de la Sal, make a small trip to Neuquen, that coast to the peaks
of the Cordillera paths comfortable.
