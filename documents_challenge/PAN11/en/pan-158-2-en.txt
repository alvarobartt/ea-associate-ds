Flimnap was unable to overcome his memory of the giant.

Early in the morning he headed to the Hall of Industry to see him. On reaching the middle of the

He cursed his name saying, "I know you function as a doctor.

The giant is in jail and no one is allowed on government property without a warrant. I am the president
of the Committee of the Man-Mountain.

Senior representatives of the Council appointed me to this position."
The other official at the arrest replied, "Being no longer necessary,
the Committee was dissolved this morning.
