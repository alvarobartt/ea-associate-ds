precious work and more plentiful than may be desired. We therefore delineate the plant.

The context of the entire narrative of this report will undoubtedly persuaded you that the media only
to advance the province and take their natural ignorance, misery and despondency where are the
communities extinguished, leaving the Indians in full freedom that each one works for their own
profit, trading the fruits and effects of their work and industry, and that in all live and
be treated like other subjects of the King. This is the dictates of good reason, and this is what

provided the light to see aid and supplies necessary for life and this disability is a powerful obstacle
to cross freedom, so that in the meantime are in community, can never acquire the necessary lights
for themselves provided the necessary comforts of life, and until they have they seem impossible
to cross the freedom not to expose it to total ruin. As thing evident to all who know that
freedom would cross the same that if every man put him in a desert with no companions, and
there had to alone provided all the supplies necessary for life, which is the same as put it
to perish.
