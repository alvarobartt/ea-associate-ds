Dear Pepe: Imagine how upset I'll be: four days since we've seen,
and rabies to quarrel with you.

Silly, silly me, did you think you know I had not find your sorrows to share? The guy you have
said, surely the questions you did and how I answered. I am convinced that all told you. You
can not imagine the grace I made her disinterest. Do you forgive me to bribe your servers? I,
however, will not forgive you your lack of candor. Pretend you're by my side and I'm talking
about very serious. Do not have repeated both over and over again that we Serna loyal? They do not
deserve forgiveness for ignoring I've hidden my love of the obstacles that will cause your brother.
