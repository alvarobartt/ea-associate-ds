 You are now most of my family and I ask for your advice. I have planned
a wedding that can save me: a marriage with wealthy person, but is not our class, but a low
origin. What should I do? ...

His aunt was waiting in a movement of surprise and curiosity. Perhaps the announcement of her
marriage softens. It was almost certain that, terrified by a danger so great for the honor his
home and his blood, raiding all, granting protection.

But the surprise, the frightened, was Jaime saw a cold smile pursed lips pale of the old.

- I know - he said -. I have told you all this morning in Santa Eulalia, after mass. Yesterday
were in Valldemossa. You marry ... you marry ... a chueta.

It took an effort to drop the word, shuddered to say it.

After that reigned in living a long silence, one of those tragic
and absolute silence that follow large catastrophes, just as if the
house had just come down, extinguishing the last echo collapsed wall.

-
And what did you think? - Timidly ventured to ask Jaime.

- Do what
you want - said the Popess coldly -.

Know we've been many years see us, and so podernos follow the rest of our lives. You and I are
now as other blood, we think differently, we can not understand.

- "So should I marry? - He insisted.

- That ask yourself.

Febrer years go by such roads, which anything of them may surprise me.

Jaime guess in the eyes and the voice of his aunt suppressed a pleasure, the pleasure of revenge,
the joy of seeing his enemies fallen in what he considered a disgrace,
and this irritated him.

- And if I get married - he said, imitating
the coldness of Dona Juana - "I can count on you?

Will he come you to my wedding?

This ended the tranquility of the Popess, and made it stand up with
pride.

Readings romantic youth came to his memory. He spoke like a queen outraged at the end of a
chapter of historical novel.

- Sir, I am Genovart by my father. My mother was Febrer, but well worth the few as others. I disown
blood will mix with the vile people, killer of Christ and I keep mine with my father, that is killing
me pure and honest.

He pointed out the door with a haughty gesture, ending the interview.

But then it seemed realize how out of time and stage of their protest, and dropped his eyes, became human,
taking an aspect of Christian meekness.

- Bye, Jaime; the Lord enlighten you!

- Goodbye, aunt.

He laid her hand, driven by custom, but she withdrew his right hand sharply, hiding behind his back.
Febrer smiled as he remembered some news of the gossips. This retraction does not mean contempt
or hatred. Was that the Popess had vowed not to touch life in the hands of other men than the
priests.

When he was in the street burst into insults silently, watching the big-bellied balconies the mansion.
Viper! I was glad of his marriage! ... When it was a fact, pretend outrage and shock at their
gathering.

Maybe ill, so that everyone on the island of pity, and yet his joy was overwhelming, the joy
of revenge incubated for many years, seeing a Febrer, the son of the hated man, lost in what he considered
the most outrageous of dishonor ... And he pushed through the agonies of ruin, should provide this
pleasure by marrying the daughter of Valls! ... "Ah, misery!"

He wandered until after noon the streets unfrequented Almudaina immediate and cathedral. The
weakness of the stomach instinctively guided their steps toward home. Ate silent, not knowing
what he ate, not seeing Mado, which worries from the previous day hovered around him, eager to
make conversation.

After eating out at a small gallery that overlooked the garden, with
its dilapidated rail of balusters topped by three Roman busts.

At his feet lay the leaves of fig trees the varnished leaves magnolieros, the green balls of
orange.

Cut in front of him blue space trunks of palm trees, and beyond the jagged battlements of the
wall lay the sea, bright, with thrills of life, as if his soft tickle boats epidermis, loose
their sails to the wind. On the right was the pass, with yellow masts and chimneys; more, there,
moving in the waters of the bay, the dark mass Bellver pine, and on its summit stood the ancient
castle, round as a place bulls, with its keep loose, isolated, no other bond than a gallardo
bridge. Below lay the red modern farmhouse Land, and beyond, the extreme point of the old port Pi,
with its signal tower and the batteries of San Carlos.

On the other side of the Bahia lost at sea, floating in the mists of the horizon, a rope of dark green
and red rocks, dark and uninhabited.

The cathedral stood out against the blue sky with buttresses and arches,
like a stone ship with the masts demolished that had thrown the waves
between the city and the coast.

More beyond the temple, the ancient fortress of red Almudaina showed his Moorish towers. In
the bishop's palace glowed like red steel sheets crystals of viewpoints, as if reflected in
a fire.

Between this palace and the sea wall in a deep pit full of grass, whose garlands of roses climbing
walls, numerous guns amontonábanse: some ancient, mounted on wheels, new age, scattered on
the floor, waiting, for years, the time to be located.

The towers were rusty armor, as the carriages, the long-range cannons, painted red and sunken in the
grass, seemed waste pipes. The neglect and abandonment oxide aged these modern pieces. The
environment that according to traditional ANTIQUING Febrer enveloped the island, seemed to weigh
on these instruments war, crumbling shortly after birth and before he had spoken.

Insensitive to the joy of the sun, palpitations bright blue extension at chirping of birds fluttering
at his feet, Jaime felt dominated by intense sadness, overwhelmed by despair.

"Why struggle with the past? ... How to free itself from its chain? ... Each birth is gesture
marking the site and for the entire course of its existence, and is useless to change position and posture.
"

Many times in his youth, from a peak to see the city and the laughing Area he had been haunted by thoughts
funeral. On the streets bathed in sunlight or the shells of the human anthill agitábase roof, driven
by needs and ideas the moment considered most important. Everyone thought the most candid and
vain of selfishness that a superior and omnipotent and directed watched his comings and goings,
equal to those of the infusoria in a drop of water. Beyond the city saw Jaime imagination monotonous
walls, cypress trees poking their points on them, a tight population of white buildings, with
windows and furnace mouths, which seemed to cover slabs cave entrances.

How many were the inhabitants of the city of the living in their seats and its wide streets?
Sixty thousand ... eighty thousand. Ay! In another village located a short distance tight,
quiet, compressed white houses among dark cypress trees, people invisible
were four thousand, six hundred thousand, maybe a million.

Then, in Madrid, had thought the same thing later that two women walking
around of the town.

The summits of the hills next to the river were occupied by dumb people white buildings arose
whose acute groups of cypresses. And side opposite big city there were also other camps in silence
and oblivion. The city lived among strong a tight cordon of nothing. Half a million living
Men swarmed in the streets, thinking he was alone in the control
and direction of life, without thinking or knowing four, six or eight
million fellow who remained invisible in the immediate burial.

Just thought in Paris, where four million residents lived surrounded awake twenty or thirty
million former inhabitants asleep forever, and the same funeral Tell them idea pursued in all
major cities.

The living are not alone in anything. The dead around them everywhere, and as they are infinitely
more, hanging over his existence with the heaviness of time and the number.

No, the dead will not be quick, as he believes the popular saying. The dead stand still the edge of
life, watching the younger generation, making them feel the authority
of gone through a rough stretch in his soul every time I try to move
away from the path marked by routine.

What tyranny yours! What power without limits! It is useless to stop his eyes and memory; They are
found everywhere, have occupied all the avenues of our existence, and leave us the way to remember
their benefits, forcing a debasing gratitude. What service! ... The house we live in was built by
the dead, the religions they created them, we obey the laws dictated
by the dead, and his work are also our passions and our tastes, foods
that sustain us, everything from the land plowed through his hands,
which are now dust.

Morals, customs, prejudices, honor, all his work. They think differently, one would be the current
organization of men. Nice things to our senses they are because they want the dead; the ugly and
useless they are mired in their vileness by the will of those who no longer exist; moral and
immoral are statements given by them for centuries.

The men who strive for new things that do nothing but repeat in different words same as the
dead said centuries ago.

What we consider most spontaneous personnel dictate what we teachers lying hidden in his bed of
earth, which, in turn, learned the lesson of other previous deaths. At the point of view of
our burning eyes the soul of our ancestors, as well as lines of our features are reproduced and
reflect the features of vanished generations.

Febrer smiled immense sadness. We think for themselves, and the convolutions of our brain waves
a force that has lived in other agencies, like the sap graft that carries power from the secular
and dying trees plantations new. What we sometimes spontaneously, as the latest addition to
our thinking, is an idea of ??the other entrenched in our brains
from birth, and suddenly breaks his shell.

Tastes, whims, virtues, defects, affinities and repulsions everything inherited all work of disappeared
that survive in us.

With what terror thought Jaime in the power of the dead! ... Ocultábanse to make it less cruel
his despotism, but had not really died. Their souls were crouching and vigilant the bounds
of our existence, their bodies formed an entrenched camp around the urban agglomerations.
We spied with stern eyes, followed us, moving away with the lowest blow invisible attempted
diversion on the route. They gathered everyone to pull devilish hard herds of men who are released
to the conquest of a new ideal and extraordinary, restoring calm
violent reaction to life, who love quiet and placid, with whispers
of withered grass and white butterflies flutter: a sweet quiet cemetery
asleep in the sun.

The soul of the dead filled the world. The dead do not leave, because
they are the masters.

The dead command, and it is useless to resist their orders.

Ay! Man of big cities, who lives dramatically, do not know who made his home who prepared their
bread, and do not see the free nature other works that the poor trees adorn the streets, ignoring
the tyranny of the dead. Does not even learn that your life is going to millions and millions
of ancestors which are piled a few steps him and spying and direct. Obey blindly pulls, not knowing
where it ends the end of the rope tied to his soul, believes all his actions - poor robot! -
product his will, if not more than enforcement of omnipotent invisible.

Jaime, lost in the humdrum existence of a tranquil island, knowing their ancestors one by one,
knowing the origin and history of everything around him - objects, clothes, furniture - and
that house that seemed to have a soul, could tell this tyranny better than others.

Yes, the dead command.

The authority of the living, their amazing new, all illusion! Deceptions that serve to make us
cope with existential ...

Febrer, watching the sea, in which weak horizon marked the smoke of a steamer thought of the great
ocean liners, floating villages, speed freaks, pride human industry, which can result in a
short time around the world ... His remote ancestors of the Middle Ages, they were going to England
in a ship the size of a fishing boat, representing something extraordinary. And the great
masters of this, with its endless herds men, had not made major achievements that the commander
Priam with a handful of sailors.

Ah, life! What delusions, delusions embroider on it to hide the monotony its plot! The limited
their feelings and their surprise is desperate. Same is to live three hundred thirty years.
Perfect men toys useful for selfishness and welfare, machines, means
of locomotion, but apart from this, as they did before now.

The passions, joys and concerns are the same: human animal does not change.

He had believed a free man, possessor of a soul called "modern", yours,
all yours, and now she discovered in a confused mass of the souls
of their ancestors.

Could recognize because he had studied, because they were kept in an adjoining room, in the
file as those preserved dried flowers crushed between the pages of an old book. Most of human memory
saved only when more of their grandparents, the families that know in detail the story of his
past through the centuries, can not account ancestral life that lingers in your soul, taking
as inspiration the cries own The ascending release within them. Our meat is that no longer exist;
our souls are pieces of other dead souls.

Jaime was living inside the grave grandfather, Horace, and with it the scruples of Inquisitor Dean,
horrible card, and the souls of the famous commander and other ancestors.

His mentality of modern man kept some of that perpetual ruler he regarded as a race apart and
vilified the Jewish converts of the island.

The dead rule. Now explaining the disgust he felt when contact Don Benito with him as obsequious
and attentive ... And these feelings were irresistible! It those
imposed on others who were stronger than him.

I sent the dead, and must obey.

This pessimism reminded him of his situation. All lost! ... He was no good small business, transactions
and arrangements that take out a life of hardship.

Resigned to this marriage that was his only salvation, and creditors, so they found out of this waiver
fading hopes, would fall upon him. Would be expelled from the home of his grandparents, and people
will pity a pity more distressing to him that insult. He felt helpless to witness the final
shipwreck of his race and name. What to do ... Where to go? ...

Remained much of the afternoon watching the sea, following the course of the white sails after
hiding out or were lost in the expanded horizon of the bay.

By withdrawing from the terrace, Febrer, without knowing how, was opening the door of the oratory
an old door and forgotten, that creak on its rusty bolts scattered
dust and cobwebs.

Much time had not come there! ... In the dense environment of thought closed room feel a vague
smell of essences, perfumes open boat and left, a smell that solemnly
reminded the ladies of the family whose portraits were in the hall.

Through a ray of light filtering through the windows of the dome Spiral Dance corpuscles ascending
million dust ignited by the sun. The altar, old class, shone quietly in the dark with hints
of old gold.

On the table was sacred some foxes and a Cube, forgotten there for years, since the last cleaning.

Two
blue velvet couches seemed old even keep track of noble and delicate
bodies that no longer existed.

Were on their desks, and forgotten, two prayer books with the ends
gnawed through use.

Jaime recognized one of these books. It was from his mother, pale and sick poor lady who shared
his life between prayer and worship of a child for which he had dreamed of the greatest greatness.
The other that had once belonged to his grandmother, American that
the days of romance that still seemed to shake the big house the rustle
of her white dress and the whispers of his harp.

This appearance of the past, still latent in the abandoned chapel, the memory of those two ladies,
one all godliness, the other idealistic, dreamy and elegant, finished
upset Febrer.

And to think that soon the paws of usury so many things come to desecrate
venerable!

... He could not see it.

Goodbye!

Bye ...

At dusk searched the terminal to Toni Clapp.

With the confidence he felt for the friendly smuggler demanded money.

- I do not know when I will give it back. I'm going to Mallorca. To collapse everything, but I
do not see it.

Jaime Clapp gave more money than he asked. Toni was on the island, and with help Captain Valls
would try to settle their affairs, if it was possible.

The captain understood business and knew unravel the most confusing. Febres and he was at odds
since the day earlier, but no matter: Valls was a true friend.

- Do not tell anyone that I'm - added Jaime -. You just have to know you ... and Paul. You're right
saying it is a faithful friend.

- And when are you going? ...

The first steam expected to come out to Ibiza.

Even had there something: a pile of rocks with weeds and rabbits, a ruined tower of the time
of pirates. I knew by chance from the day before, had told him about peasants from Ibiza he had found
in the terminal.

- The same is to be there than anywhere else ...
Maybe better. Hunt, Pescare; I live without seeing people.

Clapp,
recalling his advice last night, pressed the hand of Jaime satisfied.
It No more the chueta! ... His soul was glad payés this solution.

-
You do well to leave. The other ... the other was crazy. 

Second
part

I

Febrer watched his image, shadow transparent, floating contours
for the thrill water, through which the sea could be seen with milk
stains sand and blocks dark detached from the mountain were covered
with scabs vegetables.

Seagrasses waved their green hair shaking,
round fruit similar the prickly pears agrupábanse whitish on the edges
of rocks, flowers appeared shining pearl in the deep green waters,
and between the vegetation of mystery Starfish highlighting their
points of color, apelotonábase the hedgehog as a blur spiked black,
unruly swam damselflies, and a silver sparkle and purple, tails and
fins, swift passing between clouds of bubbles emerging from a cave
to get lost in one face of unfathomable mystery.

James was leaning
over the railing of a small sailing boat that had its fall. In a hand
held up the volanti, long thread with many hooks that almost touched
the sea bottom.

It was about noon. The little boat was in the shade.
A living lay behind Jaime windings of large spots and deep recesses
bravia coast of Ibiza. Before him stood the Vedra, isolated rock,
superb marker of thousand feet, in their isolation still seemed huge.
At his feet was the shadow of the colossus to the waters a dense and
transparent color at a time. Beyond its boiling the Mediterranean
blue shadow bubbling with gold in the sunlight, and the coast of Ibiza,
stark red and seemed radiate heat.

Jaime came to fish every day of
calm in a narrow channel between the island and the Vedra. It was
on a good day a river of blue water, with underwater cliffs hovering
over the surface their black heads
