 Since then plotted scholars
with the most scrupulous our family tree. Start a tree be called Monera, compromise between
the inorganic and organic, germ, embryo, element prime of life, endowed with a force, an itch,
a propensity for indiscriminate be a vegetable or animal. Then the tree will spread, and are
unfolding forms and differentiating, until the end of the Paleolithic age, and our ancestors have
achieved rise to the level of lizards and fish resources. During the Mesolithic age or secondary progressed
further. By going to come to an end, in the Cretaceous period, we are marsupials, that is, we,
like kangaroos and gerbils, a bag, where our little ones are hiding. In the Eocene period of
the Tertiary period, we achieved the dignity of monkeys are catarrinios, or say to yourself
monkeys with the windows down and nose to tail. In the Miocene period, and we drop tail, and we resemble
the gorrilla, orangutan and chimpanzee. In the period Pliocene are almost men, although pithecoid
and Alal, or without words, without understanding, as any monkey. Finally, in the Quaternary, the
period known as Flood, we unleashed the language, we started talking and we are true men. From
this moment sages less dramatic and more timid and economic in their chronologies, put up
the day Today some 25,000 years. Alala race, the antropiscos, the nearly men, as it were, Africa
left the center or a southern continent called Lemuria, which sank in the sea like Atlantis,
and was between Africa and Asia. These were antropiscos black as soot, and lived in herds or
flocks to fend off the beasts. So were spread around the world. During dispersal and migration,
invented languages, and here that can not be reduced to a primitive all.
