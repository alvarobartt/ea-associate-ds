 - Mom, do not know what they have done in my room these guys! - Uttered with difficulty Eulalia
and ready to weep .-- All have upset and spoiled! ... Tooth powders full of water! ... The
essence bottles open and less than half! ... Made soap a repl! ... Toothbrushes on the floor!
... The sponge full of crap! ... The quilt of my bed full of frosting! And the towel see how
they have left! ...

And showed to the bystanders with a hand towel where the coal were identified as Filthy handpick
his cousin and brother, and the other a basin containing a black
liquor thick, that by moving the left stained.

- But who has done
that? - Asked Dona Martina.

- Enrique and Miguel.

- It will be seen
more pig boy! - Exclaimed, turning to the table to close the first.

And when he drew near pulled a couple of blows that were heard in the kitchen, and this other
couple, and then another and so on, until D. Bernardo said aloud
and compelling:

- Women!

Doña Martina correction suspended and turned his eyes to her husband
with surprise.

- Notes - said he lowered his voice and pointing to
the Colonel - that there are people ahead ...

- V. Excuse me, colonel
- said Mrs. suppressed anger yet, - but I can not help ... This child
with cochinerías kills me!

The son, meanwhile, gave such cries, I will not say in the kitchen,
but throughout the neighborhood should heard perfectly.

He had risen from his chair, and at the height of the furor hit in a corner kick horrendous on the
ground.

- Contra!

Recontra! I c. .. ten! ... That slut! ... For that scoundrel! ... By that metebaza! ...

- Chis! Hush! ... Hush, child! - Said D. Bernardo, further furrowing the brow, which, indeed,
it seemed impossible.

- Come on Henry! - Dona Martina said, trying to restrain.

- Why not stick to Miguel who did more than I recontra? - Shouted
in fury.

- Come on Henry! - She cried Dona Martina .-- Let the party
in peace
