 

Remaining open to the ideas that Nietzsche and Gener are similar, Nietzsche is illogical where Gener
is logical. Nietzsche states that the Lord is dead. As gender is concerned, even though it is
often contradictory, he is called the Eternal Father when he appears and gives a long winded, pompous
speech. However, the Eternal Father is so rare that everything seems to remain the same. And in the
denial of a personal God, what will hold morality, goodness, absolute beauty and truth together
in a permanent, unchanging way? Mr. Gener denies everything in order to deny God. And I do not
reap the rewards: Mr. Gener clearly does. However, Mr. Gener also talks much of love, and says that
we must all show love
