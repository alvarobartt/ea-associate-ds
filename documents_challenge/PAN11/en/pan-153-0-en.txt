not a stick, was a tower, and below this tower rising from the sea was a base steel foam dripping waterfalls,
a ridge gray whale, which gradually took the form of a sailing vessel long and sharp.

A flag floated soon on the submarine. Ulysses knew.

- We are attacking cannon! - Shouted Toni -.

It is useless to sail in zigzags. What distance matters is winning, go straight.

The second, skilled helmsman obeyed the captain. Shook the whole town to a speed pulse extraordinary.
The bow cut the water with a growing rumor. The submersible enemy, increase its volume with the
