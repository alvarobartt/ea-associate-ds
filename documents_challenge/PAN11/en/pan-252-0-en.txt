 Do you know Why?
You'll never guess? That Linilla was in love ... Nice couple! - I .-- I am now sure that you
also love. When we talk about Angelina you can not dominate emotion. You be happy! I ... I'll
never love anyone !...»

La, beautiful young lady looked down and sighed sadly. Do not know what to say and I was watching
her.

After a short silence, during which I was dominated by the sovereign beauty the girl muttered:

-
Gabriela .... You deserve to be happy. Do you cry the sweetest dream
dead?

And reborn in this poor suffering soul flowers of hope. Love you ... And be happy!

Gabriela lifted her graceful head, and his eyes fixed on me.

I shuddered. An image that leaves my memory suddenly appeared before my eyes .... So, so many
times I looked beautiful blond girl, the subject of my first love
....

Gabriela left the book in his hands and walked slowly to one
end of the room, opened the piano, and called me, saying:

- Have
you heard this sonata?

And do not talk anymore that night.

At the end of the piece was Don Carlos:

- Come on, buddy: a game of chess ....

Since that day I chased all the time the memory of Gabriela, I spent the day thinking I in it,
and the hours were moments when I was at his side. Then yes I used to forget Angelina. Love? "Friendship?
"Love, if love? ... Byron Has not that friendship is love without wings? "

I put great effort in knowing what was happening in my heart. What feeling was that I did not
Angelina away, and that, however, dragged me to Gabriela? I accuse you of infidelity towards Linilla,
went over my actions one by one, and I though I was innocent, condemned me I judge the severity
of the straight, and I intended to get away from Gabriella. In vain!

No I spent a moment without thinking about it. It was for me to light, joy, joy juvenile first
suction love child illusion that I thought lost forever, and suddenly appeared before me,
hope that ill-fated life drunk shook his wings into the background my heart, reanimated by the
light blue eyes of the girl.

And it must be said, though no one created, but these pages make readers smile: I was not in
love with Gabriel, no, my heart was Linilla, the tender orphan loving, that there, in a corner
of the Sierra, lived with me in mind .... I did not know what force Gabriela was dragging me
mysterious. "Her beauty, elegance, discretion, the fraternal I love to make out? Perhaps all
this and something else, which I did not mind me, and that was powerful,
irresistible momentum against secret which I could not fight.

And what sleepless nights! And what days so painful! At times I was laughing at me, yes, laughing
at my folly, and cursed me of the passion that I was slowly subjugating, I was restless, and
before my conscience made me seem despicable and unfair. How right he Linilla to doubt me!

I tried to control myself, I decided, even in exchange for Gabriela believe me rude, to flee
her, and showed me several days surly and sullen. I passed me at the desk hours of rest, pretending
to extraordinary occupations, or I would I, as escaped, to wander the plain or lie on the grass under
the trees of river. Several times I caught lady to show me their drawings, and a beautiful
watercolor painted on my gift: a bouquet violets put on a wine glass
and took me to go to his call.

For the night, time that we met in the room, I stayed away from Gabriela,
leafing through the newspapers; until finally realizing that something
serious she had me pensive and downcast, he said affectionately, as
a sister who tries to console the little one favorite.

- Come on,
Rodolfo ... What do you have?

Angry of Linilla?

LVI

A weekend I received a letter from Aunt Pepa. It told me that the patient had suffered horrible
attack, that the doctor was very alarmed and worried, and that things went wrong, badly.

"I want you here, if a misfortune, to accompany me and help me. Juana does everything. The poor
and not good for caregiving, and the maid is not so. What I miss Angelina! If he were here would
not be so great my concern. Why not come, Sarmiento said that so good, that the danger is past,
and, God willing, there to fear a misfortune, for now. But I see things differently: Carmen will
not last much, that is not live, and I see every day weaker and fall. Before eating very well,
but now takes a long time I take one thing, a triumph cost to accept
medicines.

Consider me: I'm very heartbroken, just sleep, and live in constant anxiety. Don Roman came to
me, and also your friend Don came Quentin. It's a really good guy. I asked if anything could be useful
to me and if I needed anything. I said no and thanked him.

"We also came Pérez Castro girls, I asked for you and give you charge me memories of you of your
dad. I sympathize these girls, I told you. Murmuring and what indiscreet! You say! Carmen asked,
regardless of the state keeping, if it was true that you were boyfriend
of Ms. Fernandez and you were going to marry her.

A gave me so much anger, I realized that only by knowing the truth out and had come. It stayed
here more than three quarters of an hour, talking like a parrot. If they return, that they
will not, will stay in the room, and nothing in this life I'll leave to enter the chamber.

"Do
not worry or fret, if you write something serious to come. Shoot me has offered me the truth.
Yesterday I wrote to Linilla some musicians who went to San Sebastian playing in the offices
of Holy Week.

What I will spend Easter, my son! And I wanted to go to everything. Going to preach a new
parent. They say it very well. "The seven words "are going to be magnificent. In the house
of Castro Pérez are testing the 'Stabat Mater.

"But none of that I'll go. Poor Andrew comes every night, then you close your tent, and twice he
was here to accompany me.

I like that because then I'm not so alone, and if it offers something some people go to the
pharmacy or call the doctor, but I fear that one night while he is
here to pass something in the store.

"I have hope that Angelina comes to the Father, then to spend the
holy days.

God do it! "

I did not show this letter to Mr. Fernandez, and spoke of it, but I saw Gabriela pensive and sad,
asked the cause of my depression, and I told him everything.

- Well, you tell Dad!

I refused to do so. It was not necessary. He would later need to go, when things were truly serious.

So
things went on Holy Wednesday. The family went to Villaverde, and only stayed the foreman on the ranch,
I, and Mauritius, the groom, a very nice guy and very helpful.

Went to the city every day, early morning, to bring me news of the sick. The danger was over,
Aunt Carmen improved, and the letters I received were satisfactory.

Gabriela again on Easter Monday.

Happy the moment I saw it! Those five days absence were ever to me.
How I missed the girl!

I ran home for it, I would I wander through the garden, figuring
he would find there, and I took turns to my room disconsolate and
afflicted.

The piano, the drawing board, newspapers Gabriela read and plants
that she cultivated me talking about the young, and alone in the room,
I was pleased I remember his words, close your eyes to set in my mind
the image of the girl.

And yet make sure my heart was Angelina because the voices in my dreams, Gabriela did not see
me, but Linilla; to Linilla watching me sadly, as if to say:

Ungrateful! Why did you forget me?

That was madness, a delusion, something like a spell that dominated me and I had.

I said to myself:

Gabriela Are you in love? ...

And my heart answered no, no! I never would have dared to whisper in their ears loving phrase, never
have been able to say :--«¡ Gabriela ... I live for you! "No, because I loved to Linilla,
for she dreamed I said and fortune, when I thought it in the silence of the night, leaning on
the balcony, I pondered the future. I even happened if my wishes were realized, if one day I
was given Linilla carry the foot of the altar, Gabrielle and Carlos apadrinarían our wedding.

To
be loved by Gabriela? I thought not, and if you ever came to such an idea occurred to the I
took it from my mind as a thought criminal.

But I can not hide his joy that fills my mind to see Gabriela, to be by her side, talking with
her on the table or in the room, and sadness that gripped my mind when I looked away from
the charming Miss was evidence that was lit in my heart love irresistible.

"No, - I said - no, must stifle this passion was born and it just
burns me.

Gabriela flee; I will be with her dismissive, indifferent, cold, will try to make me hateful,
I want to hate me .... Vanos purposes!

Determination useless!

I I took refuge in the memory of Angelina, as in a port Savior, I repeated a thousand times as she
had told me, his words more tender his most painful, the expressions that had penetrated more
deeply in my heart and when I felt victorious and boasted of having
triumphed in myself, the voice of Gabriela, the echo of his piano,
the sound of her skirt, the smell of his clothes, anything I own did
shake, and I felt weak as a child, powerless to resist a glance, the
most indifferent, his blue eyes.

I decided to entrust my affair with Angelina Gabriela. So - I thought - I'll save, not I can
never tell that I love. "You, my dear, loving friend - I would say - you know, before anyone else, that
the happiness of this young man who is and has been very unfortunate, encrypts all my dreams, my hopes!
I'm far from it, far away, long ago I do not see, and I need to hear his name, that one need
know that I love, the love !...»

But reaching the desired time, and my lips remained mute, and the heart wanted to jump out chest.

LVII

From
time to time, after office, we went for a walk along the river to the fields sugar cane, to the
picturesque foothills of nearby hill, sometimes acaballo, the most on foot.

Mauricio Pepillo pushed the stroller, and Don Carlos and Doña Gabriela followed him a short
distance. The girl and I would stop here and there in search of flowers or ferns.

Once, seeing a great distance from the gentlemen, we sit at the foot
of a tree, a of the most beautiful of the bank, near where the river
plunges through dense reed beds.

Before we had beautiful scenery, long meadow, green Gramal, smiling
hills secular trees covered by flowering vines, orchids old trunks
villages and a thousand vines.

A remote village left the factory, the 'real', stables, which returned
to the cattle, the chapel with its tower wrapped in a blanket of ivy;
the plain right villaverdina lit for the last reflections of the sun,
and deep the high mountains of the Sierra, shady, wooded, and crowned
with fir and pitch pine.

Gabriela carefully watched the magnificent spectacle of the setting
sun, paying rapt attention the noises of the camp, the rumors of the
river, the strange humming with the insects greet the advent of night,
and I, lying in the trunk of this giant tree, not take his eyes from
the lovely lady.

Gabriela suddenly turned round and said to me simple frankness:

-
What can guess what you think?

- What?

- Can I offer you tell me
the truth?

- Yes.

- Think you .... Linilla!

- In Angelina?

- Yes,
since we left eye does not distract you from those mountains.

Love can not be hidden .... When I talk about this girl will not
you answer me .... Are you inspired little confidence?

- No, Gabriela:
Who better than you could I trust one of those secrets that are not
can save much time?

- Speak, Rodolfo, you speak.

A friend and I often give great advice .... Is there anger the girl? Well, to tell a friend.
"The girl is happy? Well said! ... Do you have ...? Ask consolation
... Are you happy?

Happiness is expansive and open. Only the pain is be reserved and quiet. Evil is for you my
friend.

"I did not do the first tell the sad story of an unhappy love affair?

- Yes, Gabriela.

- Well then, tell me who loves Linilla, and Linilla loves you ....

-
No, Gabriela, - I said, trembling and blushing, - I think your confidence,
thanks infinity the kindness with which you treat me, the kindness
with which distinguishes me ... but what about Linilla?

What I love her with brotherly affection?

- Fraternal only?

How me?

I felt choked with emotion. Gabriela wrote in the sand with the tip of the parasol a letter,
a letter, that my eyes shone like fire.

It hurt the heart I like a snake bit him.

I was jealous, jealous horrible! Who do you think Miss? That letter was the first by a man she
loved, and that name ... Was not mine!

- How to me? - Repeated the girl.

- How you, Gabriela!

- You are mistaken, Rodolfo. Angelina is the owner of that heart. I know, I have no doubt ...
my discover insights of women has long known. Angelina's name ringing in the ears you as a celestial
melody. As you see! I'm becoming a poet .... You love. "Nothing has told you? Some day you will
confess that he loves. And then she, who remains silent and her secret hidden in the depths of
the heart, speak well, and quietly, very quietly, so they say those
things! answer: - I love you!

"How do you speak of you or you?

- From you, Gabriela!

The lady laughed, and said:

- Lips say so ... But the hearts!

At that time we hear voices that call us.

The lords had stopped at a bridge where the car could not pass corcovadito.

-
Miss, call us!

- Come on.

Gabriel stood up, and before taking a step looked sad figure written
in the sand.

I, in passing, the erased with his feet.

- What have you done?

- No, Miss!

- Well done! ... Best! My crazy .... Who could forget!

LVIII

I heard you ask for me, I dropped the pen, I rubbed my eyes and went
into the corridor.

Mauritius was Villaverde returning from the correspondence.

- Have you, - said the youth, respectfully removing the Jarano - there are two letters for
you. I got one at home, the other in the mail. I spoke with Mrs. ... and I saw the sick, I
think it is very relieved because I was in the room, sit-in an armchair. I seemed very happy.
Did not offer anything? Tell him that since I came to love .... I made a duck! I took the rain
to pass through the checkpoint. What a downpour! What God commanded! The first of the year!
Go! And they needed the land, the dry was good, pastures were yellow, yellow! More livestock
is dead! I go, Don Rodolfo, I'm dripping water, and I have to unsaddle ....

I put on the table of Don Carlos the bundle of newspapers, I returned to my seat, I ended up
notes started, and then I read my letters. One was a classmate of mine who used to write from
time to time, the other of Aunt Pepa saying to me

"Carmen is going well. Sarmiento comes every day, and is thrilled, because the poor thing eats
and sleeps like a charm. Now I don Crisanto has confessed that the last attack your godmother
was very bad, so bad that came near to have ordered it.

The Virgin I have made the miracle I asked him wholeheartedly, and offered some bouquets. I
received money. Thanks, son.

God bless you. You are very good to us. Why send all salary, and nothing saved for you? Andrew
says that you owe nothing, and nothing wanted to receive. God I will always help because it is
very good and very grateful. I have taken money to tackle the clusters
of the Virgin.

You put the money and I needed the job because I made a promise by the two, for you and me. Angelina
has not written. The waiter has not come all week, and here we are with great care, fearing that
the Father continues bad. The Easter work is very heavy. Imagine that the Father has to do everything.
I I'm afraid to continue bad, but I am reassured by the idea that
to be so have already been Sarmiento, who is the doctor there, but
who knows whether, to be closer, call one of Pluviosilla. There is
there one you just received and priests say they have made very good.
What I dislike is that Angelina did not write, or even to know about
health your godmother. On Sunday I got four letters, but nothing I
said to you. If you letter send her to the boy. I know you're very
impatient.

'Say hello from us to Dona Gabriela, to Gabrielita and
Don Carlos, and say we want mejorcito child is. "

It gave me heart
skip a beat I did not think in the P. Herrera, or that he was ill.
Struck me Linilla hunch that not writing for any other cause, and,
indeed, I thought I guilty, and I thought that Angelina guessed that
Miss Gabriela stole my love.

Linilla not like me, loves me not Linilla;
Linilla want to forget, - I thought. And then oh misery of the human
heart! the poor girl took my thinking, and when I met Gabriela the
entrance to the room I thought it was another woman, another young
woman or anyone who caused me interest or was sympathetic to me
