 Pretend you're by my side and I'm talking about very serious. Have not we both repeated
ad nauseam that we Serna loyal? They do not deserve forgiveness for not knowing my love I've hidden
the difficulties that causes you to thy brother. All right, Don Reserved; to say that I do not care what
you like or angry. What you have told me not to start working in a printing since you had to
leave the race? I have sometimes said that your position and your kind of life you have not
been allowed to treat and get to know these young ladies who not having to think about anything serious
does frivolous and vain. What is, I ask you now know that having failed to confuse me with them? Let's
face the fear that seems too humble your job, the fear that was vain, I have been silenced, and
it turns out the vain you are. Like nothing I say can be angry, I risk everything: what you felt was
embarrassment by pretending to hide that made you need? You know how you call that? False shame,
something very like arrogance. Yes, Pepe, I am more loyal to you: I have offended. Say you
love me because I'm good, and have been able to assume that could make me ill effects, so, clearly,
about working in a printing press. You never fall from the lips of distance, inequality, and what
not more nonsense: just imagine you forgive them because sometimes they are an excuse to be with
you lovely
