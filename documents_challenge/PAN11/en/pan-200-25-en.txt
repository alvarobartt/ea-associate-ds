 What value does the gentleman!

- Is anything of value to beg to call your dear friend?

- For what it takes courage, great courage, is to ask the person Celia
who knows where she is.

- And I know better than you?

Come and Dona Josefa Nemesia, I do not do that. You teasing you.

- Who has the blood like water for chocolate not tease.

- Well, Celia is not here, where is? Leonardo asked truly alarmed.

- I tell the gentleman, said Nemesia angry that I was not born yesterday, and I suck the finger.

-
For God's sake, baby, I swear I do not know Celia four days ago.

Do you have fought Vds.? Does your brother have mortified? Ah! Tell me, tell me, what you love
most in this world What happened between Vds.?

What do you know?

Nemesia then began to believe in the sincerity of the anguished words
of the young, and said crying

- I was present, and I'm happy now
because I do not know what I have done to prevent to be carried Celia.

-
What a ride!

Leonardo repeated terrified and angry.

Who could be brought against His will?

- I was given the fright
she lost strength.

- Scary!

Why? Who?

- Commissary.

- What the Commissioner had to do with Celia?

- Came to light it.

- A pledge without having committed any crime? No way ... Ah! There's been a sham, a intrigue, a nefarious
plot to snatch my Celia. Tell me what happened, everything.

- I was present, repeated, but a woman of the house, he saw how the
thing happened, I told yesterday afternoon suddenly came Cantalapiedra,
Celia asked, and as she left, said he was imprisoned, he took her
by the arm, and with no one took it to no know where.

- The strange
thing is that Celia turn left without defense, without investigating
the reason for the prison.

Not that it had been agreed and warned! Which I refuse to believe. Oh the miserable henchman
that he put his hand over!

Do not know where she was taken?

- Nothing I've been out and Jose Dolores. Commissioner Celia was in a wheel.

- What a plot! As infamous as bold. But find out the truth, whatever it may be the author outrage,
I will pay to sevenfold.

Without more, Leonardo left the race for the Cantalapiedra commissioner, who, as we said, lived
in the lean of the hill of the Angel, on the side facing the wall. No was at home, and beloved
young man who was reported to be was in the Government Palace taking
orders.

Thus setting out, Leonardo in that direction, It occurred that if Cecilia had been seized under
a warrant the judge could not having led to another place in prison
(located then in the southwest corner of the palace of the Captaincy
General) and stopped in front of the gate.

Behind her, the better in the cage formed by two iron gates, a man was standing badly dressed
and the worst aspect.

In order to obtain a categorical answer, faced him Leonardo and said
air and tone of authority:

- Do you know if they brought yesterday
to the Royal Prison prey to a white girl, beautiful, dressed mourn
...?

- I do not know, "replied the man.

I am the second keyring and yesterday was not on duty.

See M. Warden in the book.

- The warden is closed.

- That is that
the warden has gone to chow.

Will the gentleman to wait until tomorrow.

Because I only await the bell of the Force to deliver the jail official
seal and yaw.

- Who is that black holding a lively conversation with
other prisoners in the yard?

- What says the Lord?

Does the white sucks?

- Yes, the same.

- A Jaruco call it that.

- Name of course, right?

- Well, his real name is not Jaruco is stuck, but asina was put in
the book and asina be called while in the Royal Prison.

Dende gayola entered before yesterday.

Do you know the Lord?

- I think so. You call him at the gate, if there is no objection.

- No pregnancy, because while being held incommunicado, we have no Bartolinas for many prisoners.
Jaruco Eh! cried the keychain from his position.

And word is repeated by other prisoners in the same tone of voice,
came Jaruco, recognizing easily the master and slave.

Entrol to it so strong convulsive shudder, which was to grab with both hands at the gate.

- Sumerced I take the blessing, bathed in tears faltered.

- Why are you crying?, Leonardo asked angrily.

- Wow, Leonardite child, remembering the hard time that I have given the family in my absence.

-
With your absence, dog? With your flight.

- Boy, I'm not fled. I left home Christmas Eve was designed to assist a dance for people of color
out there. Around the city had a tragedy a mulatto. I was wounded in the chest, I picked up an
acquaintance in the street and took me to the room in which he lived. As I spent the time healing.
After this misfortune befell me.

- What misfortune?

- The of the
unjust imprisonment.

All men are exposed to a stroke of bad luck.

- From bad luck, not
bad head.

Is seen, Dionisio, you do not want blacks for good but for evil.

If Mom had dispatched to you when you did that wit dog of yore, there
now you'd be in jail.

What crime you are accused?

- Still do not know the cause of my imprisonment, child leonardite.

-
Do not know, eh?

Is not the death of Tonda?

- Maybe I raise this false testimony, child who is bad because it falls his feet and killed.
Get office, child, I was very calm, sewing shoes a shoe shop in the Rue de Manrique, when she
appeared at the door the captain Tonda.

From I saw them I knew it was coming for me, and tried to slip away. Dismounted and went to
him as if to surrender.

At the door of the shop had a wheel stop and I slipped out between
her and the wall of the house.

Tonda I fell back shouting: - Date, date! Shortcut! He tripped over a rock, fell on the sword
that had naked and injured in the stomach. Did I have to blame for his death?

- Who caught you?

- Captain headman of Health.

I took when I left for my job.

- I guess he told you why you lit.

- No word.

He just told me he had orders to take me dead or alive.

- In good you've got, Dionisio.

It will be much and give thanks to God if she escaped with the skin.

- Whatever you want God and the Virgin.

I trust in my innocence. But do not think the kid that I love and Miss will do something for me?

- Do? Nothing. Do not wait.

By the way you have behaved decently with your masters!

For them, the whole family, for yourself, Dionisio, you'd better bend the neck in Point field.
With that you'll never insulting white girls.

- Me, Boy I've insulted a white girl or color? No, Leonardite child, I have consciousness of
having insulted any.

- And one that was the cause of your quarrel with the mulatto to the
output of the dance?

- I did not insult the child.

For the bones of my mother that I did not say a bad word. Le asked a minuet, I said she was
tired and then went to dance with José Dolores Pimienta.

I complained to her the snub, he took his defense, we lock our words and we beat a the street.

-
If you do not let you talk hanged. A otherwise.

Do you know if they have brought here the same prey young man of
your tragedy with Pepper?

- I'm sure is not here.

Just put one foot in the prison courtyard, is published and circulated shouted his name.

- God protects you, Denis.

- Child charity, another word. I remember that I delivered at his mercy a garment belongs.

-
What piece of clothing?

End soon, prontito.

- Had me in his pocket, hoping to give it one day, the watch Miss gave his market last year, but
they took it away to enter the prison. Must be in the hands of the Warden.

Dionisio told in as few words, how and when it came to power the clock and moved said to withdraw
his young master:

- Could you tell the child how is Mary Rule?

- Mom brought her wit. Is now in the city earning wages.

Have not you seen?

- No, sir. This is the first news I have of his coming. Why God did not want trip over it? I see
today in this prison.

I have served as godmother to Miss and would cook at home.

Leonardo night and returned home from the Commissioner and was surprised
in the act of sitting at the dinner table with his mistress.

- Hello!

Both good over here! Cantalapiedra said very cheerful, going to meet Leonardo, with an open hand
outstretched.

- Good to find, he said serious and cold, pretending that he had not noticed Commissioner friendly
demonstration.

- I waited, hiding Cantalapiedra said the snub the
bad impression made.

Fermina just tell me that you had honored with his presence this humble shelter.

- I can speak a word with you?

- And two hundred also, Don Leonardite. You know that I am your most obedient servant. Felt
not be in the station when you were at dusk. He had to go racing the Policy Secretariat. So
that I do not know as we are not in the way, if you come there. Bonora! screamed, a chair for
this gentleman.

- Excuse the compliments, Leonardo said haughtily. It is not for sitting.

Let's talk provided it is standing alone.

- Why not here in front of Fermina? I have no secrets from her. We are inseparable.

- How you caught authority to Cecilia Valdés? asked the young man desperately.

- Not with me has invested HM King Fernando VII, QDG, but with Mr.
Mayor to sign the warrant, a complaint from a parent.

- What Mayor
and which parent will tell you serve?

- That's too much bread in
between, Mr. Gamboa, the Commissioner said, laughing.

It seems like you something that is obscured ... Sit down and cool off.

- The girl has not committed any crime, so it is improper and illegal
to prison if is that everything has been nothing but a farce, or something
worse, God knows what purpose.

- None of this goes against me, I
have been a mere instrument in this case.

- Tell you if the name
of the complainant.

- Vd. knows better than me, and if you do not
know will know soon.

- Will you allowed to say the Mayor?

- No inconvenience:
the O'Reilly Don Fernando, Spain's largest first class Mayor of the
District of San Francisco ...

- Where did you a girl?

She is not in the public jail.

- Shall I not reveal it now.

I drove to where I was ordered.

- After you hide it dishonest purposes.

- In my refusal to satisfy
the curiosity of you does not show such outrageous deduction.

Logic, logic, philosophy student sir.

- It matters little whether
you want to throw the secretive and mysterious to me.

I must see the truth, and they may still, despite the author and instrument of this rude and
intrigue indecent.

That said, he went on his way home in high dudgeon. The family had a visitor in the room. No I
decided to enter it ready the carriage, moved in a suit, and when asked by signs her mother to
the porch railing of the reason for this precipitation:

- I go to the opera, he replied briefly.

Sang Rossini opera maestro Ricardo and Zoraida, to benefit the Santa Marta, the beautiful Teatro
Principal. [59] It was then the company entrepreneur Eugenio Arriaza, and director of the
orchestra Don Manuel Cocco, brother of Jose, which we saw in the mill La Tinaja. The patio
or yard and the boxes were occupied by a public medium then nothing
functions fan lyrics.

Leonardo came some time after the standard curtain. Of course, he heard the overture to Tancredo,
who preceded the opera that night.

Looking for a man whose place in the theater knew in advance was because, as Mayor preside over
the function from the central box on the second floor.

Sitting was the pair of Madrid wife, embedded in music and song,
as he kept the back, standing by the door, the page mulatto, livery
rigorous cover castles and lions embroidered gold.

All this I watched through the porthole in the door of the box, closed against the corridor.
Could have called, assured of a friendly welcome input, but preferred wait on the balcony of the
refreshment room which overlooked the mall Paula.

Calculated according to Leonardo, shortly after completion of the
first act, he felt measured steps through the room, then a hand rested
on his shoulders and followed a voice in a dramatic tone declaimed:
- What does the friend of the brave Othello?

- Ah!

Is that you, Fernando? The farthest I had from my mind.

- What are you doing here so lonely and pensieroso?

- I just got.

- No saw you in the lunettes.

Why do not you come at once to my box?

- I figured there was no place for me.

- For you are always by my
side.

- Thanks.

- Are you in moments of inspiration?

Is the witch on the tripod? I welcome that. Feel interrupt.

- I inspired! It can be: the devil.

- There would be nothing strange that you inspire the urban scene
that unfolds at sea the balcony.

Will you composed there in the mind an article descriptive? Insurance.

In fact, Who that houses the soul of a poet is not inspired by the
sight of row houses that unequal our right, protruding balconies high
Conde de Peñalver manor?

Or the trees in this mall without ending coffee Paula, now dark and
deserted?

Or the hospital of the same name at the bottom, which seems an Egyptian pyramid, from which
blackened top, Bonaparte said, are watching the centuries?

Or the opposite side, very dark mass of the ship Sovereign, nailed,
so to speak, in the still waters Bay?

Can not you see how it stands out from the sky where the stars sparkle? Who would not say they,
rather than light shed tears over the impending disappearance of
the last remaining our naval glories?

- Fernando, so poetic that
scene for you, it has no meaning for me.

Perhaps because I know it by heart, or because I'm black humor.

- For me, kid, always has charms of nature. In her presence forget
all my penalties.

And by the way have you read in The Journal "A trait of my visit
to Mount Etna?"

Arazoza was the other day at home in order for something original
... He insisted and gave these blots.

- Almost never see El Diario.

-
Then look for it and read it. The article is short. It was published
three or four days. I wrote in Palermo. I did not put my name, because
he says ill of a mayor ... You understand me. He went out with my
initials only and have you to believe that we have come to congratulate
me more than twenty friends? Yes Pedro José Morillas hugged me and
gave me the article with the clouds. I want to hear your opinion.

-
Afternoon is that you can give it to you, Fernando. My head burns,
I get to shoot myself, or spreading it to someone, that readings.

-
Man! I'm surprised. I know. Are you the same student in the class
of Philosophy at the College of San Carlos, or another in your figure?
What has become of that good humor and that catchy joy that you were
earning the affection of all your classmates? Stop your nonsense and
childhoods. Are you in love? You could give in such a stupid thing
after your twenties and most Aprils and your experience ...

- It
is the passion of love which consumes me with this chest. It is the
anger, the pain, is the despair that produces the first disappointment
of what are the world, men and friendship.

- Come on. Why deny it?
You're in love and unrequited. Sludge symptoms are love. What is the
real source of your troubles? Confíamelas. You know I'm your friend.

-
My friend! cried the young man with an ironic smile. I thought you
were, but I am disappointed you're my worst enemy.

- What date is
your disappointment?

- It's disservice you did to me. I do not know
how his memory will not gnaw the bowels.

- Will you have lost your
mind? Come on, man! And fall. All your anger is born ... Ja, ja!

-
Do not laugh, seriously said Leonardo. This step is not laughing.

-
Why, what is? Mayor stressed. Here is the first time, since we know
that I see serious y. .. bobo.

- Do not call to seriousness and silliness
it touches into fury.

- Stop your childish nonsense at this time.
Your anger seems to be leading me, and if you were not encalabrinar,
you would see that, far from hatred, you owe me gratitude.

- Not
missing anything, but after wounding me where it hurts most, I expect
thanks. What freshness of yours! Did you know that was my girl Cecilia
Valdés?

- I learned it the same day, as you say, I did the disservice
...

- But before that, what were you news of its existence? Did you
know his character and background?

- What had to know
