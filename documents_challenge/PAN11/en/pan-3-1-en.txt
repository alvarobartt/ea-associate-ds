 Then is
not true that there is only five ways of feeling.

CHAPTER XVIII

FINAL SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY OF-Mennais.

[106.] What we infer from this? a very important conclusion: the solution of the difficulty by La-Mennais.
The existence of other senses bring us other sensations, it is some, but not disturb the existing
arrangement. Why? Because we have shown that organization affect our bodies differently, and produce
different impressions of the five senses, and yet this did not trouble
the agreement of the sensations or alter our ideas, then the assumption
of La-Mennais would not result in the disorder he suspects.

[107.] Feelings in themselves are nothing more than emotions of the soul, and on the outside,
have nothing on their part but the existence and extension of the
bodies, then a new order of sensations could only be a new order of
conditions, which do not alter in all our ideas.

It said so far, is easy to see that the assumption of La-Mennais is already done; because there
are different sensations of the five senses, then you can not strike
with such an assumption order and the nature of our ideas, and the
certainty of our knowledge.

From a musical instrument worked in a richly aromatic wood, leave pleasant impressions for hearing,
sight, touch and smell, what you do not destroy or alter the other, if we assume for the same
object is in a new relationship with our organization, resulting in new impressions soul, why
is it impossible that they exist together with those? The melodious sound, "perchance ceases to
excite in our souls a thousand different emotions, that in nature nothing to do with it? not
true. What they fear disorder of our knowledge by the introduction of a new order of sensations?
Why give much importance to an assumption, we can calculate the effects
very well, because they examined background to the current sensory
phenomena, we see it already done?

[108.] It is true that we do not know other way to get in contact with external bodies, but by one
of the five senses, but so is that there is such contact, no correlation
so mysterious, the soul from external objects, which are totally inexplicable,
attending only to the simple sensations through which communication
is established.

Notice what happens to the magical effects of music. Reflecting on them is found which are
of two types: the purely auditory, and intellectual and moral one stops so to speak in the
eardrum, the other reaches the brain and heart, and that man will organization well adapted
to the one that will not be for that. Two sugetos hear a sonata, both perceive music just material,
but do not experience the same effects intellectual and moral. Both warn of the slightest slip
of the voice, an instrument Compass, both admire the art and skill of the composer, both enjoy the
magic rapture, but while the brain and the heart of one will be out just your ordinary state
and will not receive more than a pleasure material, will have been so exalted above the heart
and another brain: fantasy feel with multiplied strength, budge on its head the thoughts and images,
as if to descend are the magical instrument on his forehead divine inspiration. His heart is
deeply troubled: the sweet tenderness, the deep and gentle melancholy, hatred, love, anger,
generosity, courage, the impetus will be born suddenly in his breast would feel under a magic influence
which moves in spite of himself: the vibrations of a string have risen in his heart that mysterious
storms efforts of reason enough just to master.

[109.] Does this tell us? Tells us that most of the common relations between objects and the sense
organs, there are other more intimate and delicate between them and the system of our organization,
and we made up for the experience with equal certainty that common. In them more variety among
individuals, are more unknown conditions that are necessary for certain purposes, but no doubt
about its existence, and This is sufficient for the sight of sound
philosophy dent these assumptions do not cause which aim to undermine
the edifice of our knowledge.

[110.] It is thus shown what has to answer to the following difficulty: 'if give us a new sense
what would happen? "Nothing that would destroy the certainty of our knowledge, or alter the
order and nature of ideas, not another new would happen, but on many ways in which our organization
is affected by objects, there would be one more. We what would happen to a man who was deprived of
smell, and it should give all of a sudden, would have a sensation; us what would happen to
a man whose chest springs suddenly feeling had not previously experienced:
it is an affection more.

The new prints are placed in place, and not destroy or alter the
other.

BOOK THREE.

THE EXTENSION AND SPACE.

CHAPTER I.

Inseparable EXTENSION OF THE IDEA OF THE BODY.

[1.] Supposing that among the objects of sensations the extension
is the only thing for us exists on the outside, as more than a principle
of causality, we closely examine what is the extension.

For the moment, it seems that the idea of ??extension is inseparable from the body. I at least
I fail to conceive what a body unextended.

In missing the extension, go away the parties, everything disappears as it relates to our senses:
either there is no object or is something very different from what caught up in the idea of ??body.
Conceive of an apple: let's make unextended suddenly, what do you
down?

Dispense with by now if Descartes is right when you include the extension of essence of the body,
but I know very well that without the extension can not conceive of the body. I do not claim
the identity of two things, but the inseparability of two ideas in
our understanding.

No This is an opinion but a fact, that inner sense testifies.

It is true that ignoring the extension, you can conceive of a substance,
or more generally, a being, but then there is no idea of ??the body
if we do not want to be confused with the substance or of being in
general.

[2.] All the ideas we have bodies we come to the senses, missing the extension, missing all other
sensations, for without it there is no touch, no color, no sound, or smell, is therefore reduced
to an object or a thing that we have no idea, we only have one or
abstract notion, for which we can not distinguish from the others:
a pure abstraction, nothing more.

[3.] If you want to undo the difficulties opposed to the separation of the two ideas, extension
and body, would be necessary to determine the essence of the body, and when he knew his essentially
different from the extension, then the difficulty would come loose, otherwise, not.

[4.] For a deeper understanding of the inseparability of reason, it must be remembered and the
fact recorded above, namely, that the extension is the foundation
of all other feelings, being compared to them a kind of container,
substratum, not confused with any, which does not depend on any particular
one, which is a condition for all indispensable.

I have an apple in sight, and I shall examine the relationship that each have the feeling I produce.

Clearly
I can do without the odor without destroying any of the other sensations
it emanates.

Being odorless, I still large, colorful, tasty, and even Sound as it is capable of producing
some noise. Of its own destiny I can do without the taste and even the color, and everything
is related to the eye: for even in this case I find it tangible object, and therefore, extensive,
figuratively, and other properties that affect touch.

If instead of doing without regard to the view I want to dispense with what belongs directly to
touch myself, I can also do it without destroying other sensations:
for still be offered to my eyes the block with its length, shape and
color, and may retain qualities relating to the other senses.

I can still carry beyond abstraction. If the apple to spoil all the qualities that the offer to my senses,
depriving it of flavor, odor, color, light and heat also or cold, of softness or hardness,
and how much can touch it, I still the extension, not sensible, but conceivable. The extension
exists, regardless of their visibility, as there is for the blind regardless of the tangible,
as there is for the naked eye; regardless of smell, taste and sound, as there is for those deprived
of these respects, with that they have or vision or touch.

[5.] Here occurs a difficulty: it seems quite possible that mistake when it says the existence of
the extension abstracting from other sensations, because while making this abstraction we conceive private
feelings, do not lose the imagination but thereof: so, when I remove the block, full color, all
light, it gives me the apple extensive, it is true, but it is because we still imagine the color, or
if I try to deprive her of he remains for me as a black object in
a more or less dark background, other than the apple.

This seems to prove that there is illusion in these abstractions, and that there is no abstraction
complete, as to the reality of them, it happens the imagination of the same, or of others supply
them for the extension is perceived.

This objection is specious, and would be very difficult to dispel satisfactorily, if there of men
deprived of sight does not dissipate in a puff. In effect any such imaginings have a place in
the case of a blind man: for him there is no color, no shadows, no light, no darkness or anything
that relates to the eye, and yet he sees the extension, then the difficulty falter in its base,
falls to the ground.

[6.] But at least we will reply, it is necessary to confess that the
idea of ??extension is necessary dependency relation with the sensations
of touch: the blind as we have this sense, and he acquired the idea
of ??extension.

Then the idea is inseparable extension the sensations of touch. Even this result is legitimate. It
is true that by touch comes the idea of ??extension, that this sense is enough to give it, as
seen in the blind but it is necessary to touch her.

I have shown above that the simple view is sufficient to provide the knowledge of the three dimensions,
which is what which is the volume, or the extension in its full complement. Also, here I can do without
the idea of ??volume, I just the surface, the surface is inseparable extension of vision. No vision
when no color, or light, in one way or another, and this is impossible, Just imagine, when no
surface.

Another reason. The geometry, conceived without doubt the extension, and yet completely dispense
its relations with the touch and sight: then there is between them and that any connection necessary.

In
any object subjected to the sight, what is the relative quality of touch, necessary to give us an
idea of ??the extension? Examine it and see any. We have before us a liquid; Do you need fluency?
No: it freezing, there remains the extension. Does cold or heat? No: it saves the extension,
we will go through many degrees of the thermometer, without alteration
visible.

Imagine the quality you want from those relating to touch, and you will notice that the vary, modify,
or remove completely, without altering the extension visible.

We often happens that we have very clear, lively, given the idea of ??extension of an object without
knowing anything about his qualities on to the touch. I see from far away an object: color
and figure I have the eyes in all its details, but I do not know what material is, if marble
or clay, or wax, or what state of matter, whether soft or hard, wet or dry, hot or cold. I can
even know whether it is tangible, as in the figures which are formed from vapors imperceptible
to the touch simple.

[7.] Without extension no vision or touch, nor can any other sensations. In terms of taste is
not difficult to be convinced of this if you notice, requiring touch, and that failing this, one
can not exist. No shows this truth so clear about smell and sound, because if it is true that we do
not separate these feelings the idea of ??extension, always wrapping it in a way or another,
however there is still to know what would happen to those who were deprived of every sense except
the ear and smell. But without having to enter guesses such a scenario, just Knowledge: 1.
º What about our organization can not do anything that is not extensive, were it not means
that we are entirely unknown, and give us any idea of ??what we mean by the body, 2. º What
are received even if the sensations of hearing and smell without accompanying any idea of
??extension, in which case they would not be for us more than mere phenomena of our spirit, that
we would communicate with the outside world, as we now understand, because if we did not know
who come from other causes would not more awareness of the self, and if we knew, this case
does not offer us but as an agent that influenced us, and in no way as a being that had anything
like to what we understand by body. 3. No. That in this case, we would have no idea of ??our
own organization, or the universe, it is clear that reduced everything to internal phenomena,
and his relationship with the agents that produjesen, always missing the idea of ??extension,
or the universe or our body itself would be for us nothing of what
they are now.

What would the world unextended? "Even our own body? 4. No. That for now we simply show reliance
on that according to the current system are all about feelings to the extension, and this
is not destroyed, even if he did not possess more than smell or heard, no idea of ??the extension
formed, nor the need to experience their feelings. 5. No. That even in this assumption, there
is always standing the settled proposition: that the idea of the extension is independent of the
other sensations. 6. No sign remains also truth as we intended mainly demonstration, to wit:
that for us the idea extension is inseparable from the body.

[8.] This inseparability is as true that theologians to explain the
mystery of August the Eucharist, have distinguished themselves in
the extension of the body, the relationship between the parties yes,
and the relationship with the place: in ordine ad se, et in ordine
ad locum, saying that the sacred body of our Lord Jesus Christ is
in this August Sacrament with the extension in ordine ad se, but lacks
the Chapter in ordine ad locum.

This proves that theologians have been not be possible for man to
lose all idea of ??extension, at the same time without losing any
idea body, and so have excogitating the ingenious distinction which
we have seen, and which I think take care elsewhere.

CHAPTER II.

Imperceptibility EXTENSION AS OBJECT direct and immediate sensation.

[9.] The extension has the remarkable peculiarity of being perceived by different senses: as
the sight and touch, is evident, and it is not difficult to convince the same with respect
to the others. Perceive the flavor in different parts of the palate, we refer the sound and smell
to different points in space, and this involves the idea of ??extension.

But the singular that is offered in the extension is to be an indispensable basis for all sensations,
and therefore be perceived by all senses, it itself, and separate of any other quality, is imperceptible
to everyone.

The view does not perceive what some way or another is not lit, the ear does not perceive what
does not ring, nor the palate that does not know, nor smell it does not smell or touch what
is not hot or cold, dry or wet, hard or soft solid or liquid, etc. etc., and yet none of this is
the extension, nor any of this particular, it is necessary to be perceived the extension, then,
that all these qualities is found at each step separately and no
longer be perceptible.

In particular therefore no is necessary to its visibility, but disjunctively self: one or other of these
qualities will is indispensable if one of them is not accompanied,
are entirely imperceptible to sense.

From this it follows that the
extension is a necessary condition to our feelings, but it itself
is not felt. But not to be felt no longer known, and this is me leads
to other considerations, leaving the phenomenal order, and entering
the transcendental lead to extremely serious, extremely difficult,
intractable so far, and it is feared they are also older.

[10.] We
have seen that the extension itself, not to be confused with the object
of other feelings: What is it then? Considered in its own nature,
what is it
