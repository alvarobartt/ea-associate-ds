 Snakes of the mountain with a strange voice singing in this
silence. Singing, yes sir. There was no one discussed it at Lobato, I had heard thousand times,
and doubt this call was a liar, exposing them to feel the weight of his paws. And as they sang the
reptiles, spoken by the bulls, only that he had failed to penetrate all the mysteries of their
language. Were like Christians, but walked on all fours and had horns. Seen them awake when
the dawn came. Joyful leaping as children, toys and cross-believe rushing their horns, trying
to mount each other, with a noisy joy, as if he welcomed the presence of the sun, which is the
glory of God.
