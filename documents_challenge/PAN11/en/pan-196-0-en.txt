 It was the general conflict and enemies constantly redoubled their attacks, fighting
with desperate obstinacy, confident in the crowd, opposed to that our constant resistance everywhere
when D. Andres Calisaya with a piece of horse made a turn at the top of the village, passing
through Guansapata Castle fell into Orcopata through the multitude of enemies who occupied this post,
and at the expense of bizarre and determined action, not only managed to surprise, but leaving much admired
courage, the besieged had a short interval to take some breath. But very soon became again,
and with greater commitment, to hostilities prevented from useful to break down the walls the
enclosure and sought an entry less difficult and dangerous, as indeed did so, penetrating to the
back of the Inn of Santa Rosa, where they set fire to houses on that side, that already is considered
possession. But a short time enjoyed the privilege, because they were evicted from that post
by the adjutant, with the troops under his command, who, after their rejection, promptly interrupted
the progress of the flames.

The commander of artillery, D. Francisco Vicenteli, always attentive to the passages that were considered

From the fort located at the four corners of the chief's house D. Anselmo Bustinza, they fired
a gun at his own expense cast, with which it defended part of the campaign was found on that
side, and not just contained to the besiegers, but also freed the fire to the whole neighborhood

that was the only win they got that day: short in reality, and that in no way corresponded to
the loss they had suffered in so many and as repeated assaults, in which they had established
an effort and consistency that could not never expected or believed in a nation that had previously
been considered a character fickle and weak.
