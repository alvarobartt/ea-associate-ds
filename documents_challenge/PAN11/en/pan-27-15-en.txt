between the orchards, gardens and green woods, where it was open the road, a white cloud which
went bigger. Then we saw a dark stain that moving towards us. Soon after came at a run one of my
scouts told me that Nanar approached to greet me with large party. In this dark spot had enlarged

The King and I got out of the palanquin of the car, and we welcome and embrace each other with mutual
cordiality.
