 

I would caution you not to retreat from writing, but to persevere. Gloom and pessimism may take you
by storm. This is but a symptom of the times in which we live. Faith is growing more scarce, and
is being replaced by desperation. People take solace in fiction and the works of writers such
as Calderon, as we've already discussed.

So accept that the world is a vale of tears and wickedness.

    We can still be confident
    that God will overcome the
    cross and his light will
    shine -- Heaven and earth and all they contain are ultimately his
creations
