 Son and resident of land plain,
mountains and sky saddened me fuzzy fearfulness me. Once one had been in the mountain capital,
masking a desire to tread "the land of my ancestors" my father would say, the temptation to spend
the summer at the port began to be "elegant." Rail crossing near the Cantabrian Mountains above
the sources of the Ebro, recalled that "there" did not know whether the right or left, had to
walk my ancestral home, in a withdrawal of those mountains mists and tight hooded black oak. And then
had more resonance in my heart this much-vaunted "cry blood."
