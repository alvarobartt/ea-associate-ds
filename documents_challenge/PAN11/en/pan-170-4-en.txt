 We acusábamos to Nanar as Parsondes had accused
him before, but our voice, less authoritative than yours, did not touch the heart Art, or decided
to topple him Nanar, and more moderated put another King in Babylon. Nanar was more skeptical
and libertine Sardanapalus, Babylon and was worshiped under another god Milita and interest,
or as it were, to Venus. In vain my comrades and I preached corruption. The common people and nobility
we laughed in his face. We vengábamos to talk about the holy life of Parsondes and put in contrast
to the life they carried.

So things were going, when Art called me early morning early to his presence.

- There is hope, he said, that Parsondes still alive, but if dead,
it is necessary to avenge and punish her killer, which can not be
other than King Nanar.

- Your wisdom, sir, I said, is like the light,
which penetrates and find out.

Vences the crocodile in wisdom and insight lynx, but how did you know that can Parsondes still
living, and if dead, his murderer was Nanar? Do not have secured the wizards Parsondes is in heaven?
Have not found the astrologers in the blue vault star before never seen, and have not recognized that
star Parsondes soul?

- That is true, "replied the king, but I have come to find out, by disclosing some Nanar Babylonians
disgruntled gentlemen, it, furious that claimed Parsondes against him, seven years has sent
emissaries to all parties to secretly take him and taken to his palace, and there must be Parsondes,
or dead, or suffering horrible torments.

- Ah, sir! I cried to the point, prostrate at the feet of the King, it is just an evil revenge dreadful.
Allow me to be the instrument of your revenge, and save my dear teacher
the captivity in which, if not dead, is.

The King told me that to this end had called me, and immediately prepare
to leave with me the support due, and his strict orders to answer
me with your Nanar life of the holy man, or his release.

That same day, which was one of the hottest of summer, I went to Susa in a chariot Arab drawn by
four horses. A skilled driver was addressed, and two Ethiopian slaves also accompanied me in
the car, with air on one with an ostrich feather fan, and holding the other on rich ivory varal,
neatly styled, the wide umbrella silk. Four riders, all quivers, bows and arrows, clothing and
covered mesh head with individual bronze helmets, gleaming colors Niel, I followed and gave me greater
authority and decorum. Six scouts, mounted zebra striped and lightning-fast, went before me, to
advertise in the various populations.

Victuals and drink that we brought to supplement the shortcomings of the way, came on the backs
of twenty powerful elephants.

Not to be too wordy, not referring here minutely the events of my trip. Suffice to know that
the tenth day we discovered in the distance the huge walls of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar work and
Nitocris. They were thirty yards in thickness, surrounding the city, forming a zone twenty-two
leagues of circumnavigation, and rose, at the lowest hundred and twenty yards above the earth as
much as the bells of the cathedrals now. Crowned by a tuft of green walls. They were hanging
garden. On the walls and gardens stood out some buildings such as royal palaces, the temple of Belus
and the famous tower of Nimrod, which consisted eight-story, more than two hundred yards high
first. From the top of this tower, it seemed to touch the sky, presumed to treat the gods
sages, secret intelligences or spirits that move the stars. Although still far apart, and confusedly,
thought and to perceive the colossal figures carved and painted on exterior walls of palaces
and temples, those man-headed bulls and men with head lion, those heroes and those warriors, tight
girdles kidneys, that is Oliba Oala and fell in love. The sun reflected from the East on the
gigantic buildings and huge hundred gates of the city, which were of gilt bronze. The glow
given off dazzled eyes. The Euphrates and Tigris, winding and also
injured by lightning the sun shimmered in waves, resembled two gold
ribbons melt forming a loop.

The beaters had gone ahead to announce my arrival. Suddenly we saw up in the broad, fertile
plain between the orchards, gardens and green woods, where it was open the road, a white cloud
which went bigger. Then we saw a dark stain that moving towards us. Soon after came at a run
one of my scouts told me that Nanar approached to greet me with large party. In this dark spot
had enlarged exceedingly, and began to hear distinctly the sound of musical instruments, the
neighing of horses and the clatter of weapons.

We note, finally, the glow of gold and silver, luxury clothes and the magnificence of those
who came to greet us.

So that the driver did goad the horses, and soon I was near the King Nanar that palanquí came in a magnificent
bamboo, sandalwood, pearl and sustained by twelve handsome young men. The King and I got out of
the palanquin of the car, and we welcome and embrace each other with mutual cordiality.

King's robe was of cloth of gold, embroidered with multicolored silk. The embroidery is represented
all the flowers of the field and every bird of the air and all the stars of the ether. Wearing King
no less wonderful a tiara, bangles and bracelets, and earrings two round pearls each size
of a quail egg.

Her hair fell in curls over the back perfumed, and his beard was menudísimos curls, artistic
and symmetrically arranged. Her dress and delicate fragrance him goodbye. Despite my severely,
I could not but admire the fineness of the King Nanar, and confessed, back in myself, that was
the most comm'il faut that I had tried in my life.

The King I stayed in his palace, I gave lavish parties, and I was distracted in such a way that
almost made me forget the object of my mission. We had a concert and a dance, and a dinner
style that gave Baltasar many years later. I did not dare to ask King what he had done in Parsondes.
I did not understand that a man so excellent, that he entertained and regaled guests with elegance
and courtesy that, had been killed or had in hard captivity of my dear teacher.

Finally, one night I plucked up all my restraint and resolve, and told Nanar, on behalf the
King my master, who at the time was going to say where was the virtuoso Parsondes if not want
to lose the kingdom and life.

Nanar, instead of answering, he brought the point to all cantatrice the Bayadere and was in
the palace: it is understood that off-campus, harem or whatever you
call, reserved for their wives.

The Milita such priestesses moved from nine hundred, and were the most beautiful and skillful
that could hardly be found in all Asia. The girls came dancing, singing and playing flute, finger
cymbals and harps, it was a matter of taste to see them and hear them. I sat rapt. Nanar he said,
and here was the more my amazement:

- Behold the holy Parsondes among these women.

Parsondes, come here and greet your former student.

Went out from the center of that crowd one female, were it not for the beard, had could be confused
with women. He wore black painted eyebrows, eyelids blue, in order to shine more eyes and
cheeks covered with lipstick. It was all perfumed her dress was almost as rich as the King, his
effeminate and languid gait, his ears hung exquisite earrings, from his throat a necklace of pearls
encircled her forehead a wreath of flowers. It was the same Parsondes, who threw her arms around
his neck.

- I am, I said, well other than he was before.

Return, if you want to Susa, but do not say I live it, that wizards do not be offended, and to continue
taking a recent example of holiness to appeal. Nanar avenged my rough and unkempt making me
a prisoner under and sending me soaping and scrubbing with a scouring pad. After washing my continued
and perfuming twice a day, giving me a hitch, and forcing me to be with all these bright young
ladies, where I ended up forgetting my Zoroaster and austere preaching, and convinced that in
this life time we must have the best possible without engaging in
the lives of others.

Care Agenos kill the donkey, and none more so than who mixes in censoring
the vices of others, if only it lacks the opportunity to into them,
or when, if they have not fallen, it must be out of ignorance, bad
taste and rustiqueza.

I put my hands on the ears to hear such blasphemy from the mouth of that wise admirable. I was
desperate and angry to see him become a bon vivant, with their points and collar of shameless
rascal, but to avoid scandalous gossip, I decided to advise the school
of wizards to continue arguing that Parsondes had risen to the empyrean,
and to continue venerating his image, without discovering never before
flatly denying that he lived with Parsondes the dancers of Babylon
in the palace of Nanar.

In this awoke from my dream and I turned to find my poor house of
this court.

- I think, added our friend to finish his story, with
less wealth and less cost can the day Nanar seduce upbraideth Parsondes
that immorality and vices, moved, not charity, but of envy.

Those who are not sure of the virtue and fortitude of mind must therefore
be more lenient with Nanar.

Woe to him who boasts virtue without one probadísima!

Blessed are those who practice it and shut up!

THE PREHISTORIC BERMEJINO

OR BLUE SALAMANDER

I

I've always been fond of science. When young, I had a thousand other hobbies, but now I am
old, the prevailing scientific hobby and triumphs in my soul. Unfortunately or Fortunately it
happens to me something very singular. I like science inversely delas truths they are showing
exactly. So I just am interested in sciences, and inaccurate I love. Hence my penchant for
philosophy.

It is the truth that appeals to me, but the effort of speech, of subtlety and imagination which is
used to discover the truth, but undetected.

Once discovered truth, well proven and patent, usually leave me cold. Thus, a gallant young man,
when you go down the street in pursuit of a woman whose walk gracefully
and whose waist you excited, then come on, the look at his face and
sees that it is old, or one-eyed, or have nosed monkey.

The man would also be a cabinet if he knew the truth, but truth to be pretty. It quiet in their
possession and enjoyment would be silly. Better, then, we know little. What matters is knowing
enough to appear or be discerned the mystery, and never enough for an explanation or clarification.
Thus curiosity is aroused, comes alive fantasy and make up theories, dogmas and other witticisms,
entertain and comfort us during our earthly existence, all of which
would lack, being a thousand times more unhappy pure rude if we were
not present the mystery, or if we managed to unravel a pure business
his deep and true meaning.

Among these inexact sciences, which so delight me, there is a very in vogue now, which is subject my
favorite. I speak of prehistory.

I, not knowing whether I am right, divided into two parts this science. One that I would call geological
prehistory, is based on the discovery of skulls, cops, arrows and spears, stew and other gadgets,
involving scholars who are of an age very remote, called stone. This prehistoric amuses me so, and has,
I see far fewer sets you will hear that call philological prehistory, based on the study of
primitive language and documents written in them are preserved.

This is the prehistory makes me more grace.

What variety of opinions!

What acute guesswork! With what art are arranged and sorted facts to fit the system that shapes
every wise! And all civilization born in Egypt, and the Acadia in the center of Asia, and comes
from India, and a continent called Lemuria, which sank in the deep sea, the South, between Africa
and Asia, and from another continent, that between Europe and America and was called Atlantis.

On
the primitive language, as well as the primitive civilization, is still disputed. Up it was
a dispute over whether or were several languages: that is, whether the men began to spread around
the world Alal, or say, still speechless, and in flocks, and then were inventing different
languages ??in different places, or whether they spoke before the
dispersion and all a single language.

My itching to browse induce me to read how many new books come out on this subject which are not
few, and the more wrong-headed they are, things looks the multitude
of the timid, the more I enjoy these books.

In recent days the books I read are contrary to the Aryans, the Egyptians, of the Semites and other
nations and castes, that went by the civilizing degree superior. If the old books have argued
that civilization, such as sunlight, spread from East to West, these new books claim that
spread in the opposite direction from West to East. All knowledge of the Magi from Iran and
from Shinar, from the Brahmins the banks of the Ganges, the priests of Isis and Osiris, of the initiated
in Samothrace and the towns of Phoenicia and Phrygia, is worth nothing compared to the knowledge
of certain Gauls primitive light whose center was in a prehistoric
Paris.

The Gauls and their bards and druids, poets and priests taught him everything but his own, science
and reflection was not confusing and I remember full of science possessed, in the center of fertile
and beautiful country now called France, before the coming of the Celts, men more primitive and excellent
call or protoscitas Hyperborean.

But what language they spoke these protoscitas or Hyperborean, the center and focus of civilization
was a Paris of the past six or seven thousand years at least?

Spoke the language Euskara, Basque populace. Where had they come? They had come from Atlantis,
which sank. What knowledge did they have? They had all the knowledge we have today and many more
that have been darkened by of fables and other trifles. Thus, the arimaspes, who had one eye
and looked the sky, astronomers were then, they already knew the telescope, and the arrow that
Abaris was riding from one end to another of the earth, was the balloon
or a device to fly and compass direction, etc.., etc., etc. It is
understood that the time of the arimaspes and the decadence Abaris
are Hyperborean civilization.

I confess that I loved this whole system. It is not my purpose to expose here. Step flying on it
and go to my issue.

Say, however, which I loved for two reasons. This is the first how much I like France. How is
natural that the seeds of European civilization was born and flourished from old, in that fertile
and rich garden soil at the privileged, not in Mesopotamia or on the banks of the Nile? And the
second reason, that I have friends in Gipuzkoa, which shall rejoice much if it is proved that their
language and caste were instrumental that he used to kill Providence barbarism, illuminating the
world and indoctrinate other nations.

Much rejoice at this, if still alive, as I wish, my learned friend of mine and D. Joaquin Irizar
and Moya, who has written remarkable works on the Basque language, throwing trip the Erros, Larramendis
and Astarloas! Something he will use the brand-new inventions give more force to your system, arranged
so that fit and fit in with the most perfect Catholic orthodoxy.

Anyway, for me it is clear that before the Celts penetrated into Spain, the Phoenicians, the
Greeks and other nations, was in Spain a civilized people, we call
the Iberians.

These people spread across our peninsula, and even had colonies in Sardinia, Italy and elsewhere,
as William Humboldt has shown. Were Basque and spoke the language Euskara. The most cultured
nation and state and illustrious among them was the republic of turdetanos, who, according
to the testimony of Strabo, had laws and cute lyrics and poems in
verse, had six thousand years old.

However, the alphabets and Turdetano Celtiberian that reconstructed and publishes Don Luis José
Velázquez, are very modern compared to the date cited above. These scripts are a reflection of
the Phoenician or Greek, and it should be assumed therefore, that
before coming to Spain Greeks and Phoenicians, had turdetanos its
own alphabet, which they wrote their poems and other works.

In my view, Mr. D. Manuel de Gongora y Martinez has had the glory of discovering the alphabet. See
inscriptions Antiques Osiris in prehistoric Andalucía, de la Cueva of signs and other caves and
hiding places, some of which are near the site of Villabermeja, a
place that I've tried to make famous as its most conspicuous inhabitant
D. Juan Fresco.

Within walking distance there is a site Villabermeja that the Laderon
last name, where every day discovered remains and relics of an ancient
and flourishing city.

The learned and sagacious antique D. Aureliano Fernandez War there was evidence Favència, time
of the Roman city that was called much earlier Vescio.

Don Juan Fresco, excited his curiosity and fueled his tireless activity,
since the Mr. Gongora, publishing in 1868 his Antiquities, put on
the track, has been to seek Cave written signs and other landmarks
that are near Vescio, and has found and assembled in much copy.

Emulate Champollion Figeac, Anquetil Duperron, Burnouf, Grotefend, Oppert and Lassen, my referral
D. Friend Juan Fresco believes he has decoded these primitive scrawl Iberian, such as those other
wise, the hieroglyphs, cuneiform writing and other recesses.

I'm not trying to advocate here by the discovery of my namesake and countryman and demonstrate
the obvious. This we will do it in your day. I will limit myself to relate a story that Don
Juan Fresco says he read some entries similar to the Cave of the signs. Understood letters,
it seems that the other is flat, because the language is almost primitive
Iberian Basque now.

I regret not give here the exact translation of the original text. Don Juan Fresco did not
want communicate it. I will, therefore, breaks the narrative with explanations and comments
interspersed that he has done. Not otherwise be understood.

The story is relatively modern, for, as my friend, have yet to discover legends and stories
in Proto-Iberian, oldest and most venerable Egyptian poem Pentaur about a feat or Rans Sesostris
II, and that the poems found by our known Mr. Layard diplomat in the library of Ashurbanipal
in Nineveh archaic poems and eight centuries BC, and translated most of the sacred language of the
Akkadians, then so dead like Latin with us now.

And this should not wonder, because according Roisel at The Atlantis, all culture comes from these,
before been in Chaldea, Assyria, in Egypt or at any point of the East.

It is unfortunate that we still have no documents of the Golden Age or Golden Age of Atlantic
Parisian literature of place some eight thousand years, or the emanation of that bética culture,
implemented by the banks of the Guadalquivir turdetanos.

The document found, deciphered, explained and commented by Don Juan Fresco is relatively time fresh,
as it were of yesterday morning. Iberian and indigenous culture had declined and Spain were full
of even Phoenician and Greek colonies. Those had already founded Zazinto Sagunto, and for over a century
they founded the Tyre to Malaga, Abdera, Hispalis and Gades.

It was for the years 1000, BC vulgar, on more or less.

II

Vescio was an important city of the Confederation of Turduli. At the time we mean, the vescianos
already had the same quality as the day their descendants have been
dictation bermejinos valid: almost all were blond and some candles.

Stood out among all as fair as well as handsome and dashing, elegant and noble young man Mutileder.
Sling shot and killed extraordinary ability to planes passing stones flying, riding on horseback, drove
a car like few war, he knew by heart best verses composed turdetanos and also very regular,
with a club in the powerful was a tremendous right hand man, with women was sweeter than a arropía
and more without gall a dove, ran like a deer, fighting tooth and nail as bears, and had another
crowd of clothes that were recommended. You can almost ensure that his only fault was being poor.

Mutileder,
lost his father and mother, had no urban land and rustic, lived as love staying with his uncles, and
Vescio did not know what used to make a living. Was a man, as they
say, without a job or benefit.

And was bordering on twenty-four, and tired of this life, and longing
to see the world, called blessing to his uncles, who were accompanied
by some the money, and also taking weapons and horse, Vescio left
to seek adventure and how to improve the condition.

As Mutileder presence was so beautiful, and it was also nice and happy, everywhere was very pleasing.
The bells sugetos of fancy and he was invited to dances and parties
and the funniest ladies and haughty eyes put her love, but he was
good, prudish and simpleton, and took out anything useful from this.

The money they gave him his uncles was consumed, and no new money
came to replace him. 

Thus, stopping in different populations, for
example, Igábron, passing then Síngilis today Genil, entering the
land of the turdetanos, and also stopping Ventipo, came to a place
of Bastulos Aratispi was then called, and I suspect he be the Alora
of our time, as famous for their games plains. There was Mutileder
a cousin who was a sun of beauty, with eighteen years of age, and
fairer than he, if fits. This premium is called Echeloría. His father,
widowed and very wealthy, the idolized.

Mutileder and Echeloría were
pure Iberian breed, without any mixture of Celts and Phoenicians.
Their families, or better say his family, he was one of them, he boasted,
not without reason, descent from the primitive Atlanteans who had
migrated many centuries ago, when sank into the sea of ??Atlantis,
and, going a long sea, had led Egypt culture, civilization long before
the issue of Osiris, while others, known after the name of Hyperborean,
landing in France, had spread the light and founded flourishing States,
walking to the East to the mountains beyond Rifeas, and influencing,
Finally, in the awakening to political life and cult of the Aryans
and Semites.

In short, Echeloría and Mutileder were two illustrious
and worthy of being on their merits.

Just met, they loved ... What
say you loved? Fall in love to each of the other and the other one.

Echeloría's
father, who had nothing to dull, then noticed the girl's love and
tried to kill him, because the cousin had no other assets to his passionate
heart; but Echeloría was really in love, and the father, who at heart
was a blessed, agreed and resigned after Mutileder aspired to be his
son.

Both lovers swear eternal fidelity. "Rather die than be different,"
she said
