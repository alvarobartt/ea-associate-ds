and two religious doctrine to the Indians, were administered sacraments and serve the direction
of their souls, divided command, before was one person who cared for the spiritual and temporal.
These men were elected and appointed officials as they found, most were very young men, and
without prudence or knowledge. The Indians, accustomed to obey only their priests, they looked at first
with indifference administrators as dictated to them, so that nothing was done without first the
father. These principles were born the great discord among priests and administrators, and
contributed largely to the ruin of nations, as Don Francisco Bruno complaint de Zavala in the
representation made to His Majesty the year 1774. The priests were homeowners major colleges named,
not allowing them to live in managers; did the same thing with the gardens and orchards, all
intended to provide at its discretion; and as the Indians were on their side getting as they pleased. Procurose
remedy these reckless claims of some religious orders of government, but not a step ahead of
it without causing the Indians many vexations and annoyances; because addicts always obey the religious,
not to influence them ceasing their maximum breach of peace, the rigor needed to use them to
hold them to the government.

Consiguiose at last made known to the Indians only in things pertaining
to salvation should pay careful heed to their priests, and the rest
to their managers, but not This cessation of discord between administrators
and priests, because as each other live in the same house and with
some dependency in office, never made up in their distributions.

The priests wanted the Indians attended every day at Mass and the rosary, when they wished, which was
often quite unexpectedly, administrators it prevented, sometimes rightly and sometimes without,
and what was that the priest was sent spank those who obeyed the administrator and the administrator
to those who obeyed the priest; and each other punishments were executed in the wretched Indians, no more
guilt to obey to better accommodate them to obey, even the magistrates and council members themselves
were not free of such abuses, which not infrequently were beaten and abused by priests and
administrators, not knowing which party snuggle. This persecution is not so much in the day,
and, although time and again experienced, not to fuss.
