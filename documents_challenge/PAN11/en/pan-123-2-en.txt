was the first thing that went through the eyes of the wretched, opened as soon as pursued with
an eye for each other. No one was in the spot it had occupied before the storm, and lay buried
pepazo half down on a pile of snow out of oak and a few steps from the ravine ... But there was
one! Chisco missing! and unresponsive to voices with which it was called, nor was he seen
it anywhere ... Where do you seek? What site had served in the oak? Who was near him? Who had seen
the burst the black cellerisca?

At that moment took pepazo their stringers of snow and began to speak. He had believing themselves
out of oak outside to feel safer in the face the first whipping "the cloud". Observólo Chisco,
who was at his side, and called for a return to oak prior to before, if he did not fly over the cliff
or fall into it buried both gave: pepazo no, and yes Chisco, flings himself upon the other to put
him in. for good or bad, it explodes into the cellerisca, and did not pepazo to hear or see
nor feel anything of this world to what he was seeing and hearing this.

as it ceased to speak of a rose was planted on the edge of the ravine, and there he sniffed,
with the ease of a good dog nose in all directions even in the black depths of the abyss.
