 

And ANSI, these gentlemen are left to gather é became as he had previously done, in the board
which talked as Dies order to Inca Yupanqui had the fringe of the State they so wished. And
so he agreed Dell Dellos itself and on behalf of themselves, to send Viracocha Inca messengers,
why send him to pray that either had by come to the city of Cuzco, letting him know the new
building of it, which the slack to see: and for them to do unto them mercy and contentment,
had for it to give to your child Inca Yupanqui, who longs to come this coming, the tassel
of the State, as he had disistido Dell and said to the chiefs who had gone to see him, he gave it
disistia Dell and his son Inca Yupanqui, so from then on the é had in his head was placed by
them; which had not wanted to do for him to have respect as his father.

And this ANSI agreed by the lords of the way that you have heard, sent his messengers Viracocha
Inca to where it was populated in the yardarm, which Viracocha Inca, as he saw the embassy The Lord
sent, came to the city of Cuzco, which come, as was known by the Inca, salióle to receive
him at road and saluted him as their Lord and father, and so he went Together we entered the
city. And when Viracocha Inca city so well wrought and built é buildings Dell, and knew [87]
the government order and Inca Yupanqui had put it, anxieties of deposits and the rest, concerning
the good of his country, and love all I had, craves the city as the chiefs and gentlemen, for
the good governance The ruling and grant them to the craving in the presence of all the lords
of Cuzco and chiefs who were there, seeing the magnificence that represented the city and its buildings,
said to Inca Yupanqui Inca Viracocha, "Truly you are a child of the sun, I appoint you king and
Lord. "And he took a puff on his hands, took it out of his own head [88].

And it was a custom among these gentlemen, that when that well is to, the fact that such fringe
I put him on the head to the other, to put it together, I had to name the name, which was
to have from then on. And ANSI, Viracocha Inca, as he put an tassel in head, said: "I name you
today to nominate you yours most other nations é I was subjected, Pachacutec [89] Indichuri
Capac Yupanqui, "which says:" Back in time, King Yupanqui, Son of the Sun "- The Yupanqui is
the lineage é do alcuna they are, because craving is called Manco Capac [90], which had surnamed
Yupanqui.

Inca Yupanqui and ANSI appointed by King and Lord, in the presence of those who were there,
Inca Yupanqui ordered to go there brought a pot that was used, é craves as [91] the level found
bring forth out of the house do this pot without washing, but who craves as was, is the favorable
answer; ANSI é being brought, he ordered that there inchiesen chicha, craves dirty as it was,
é being ANSI full, ordered that the necessary orders to his father
Inca Viracocha, and bade him take craves and so he drank it while
the thing it [drop?].

É seen by Viracocha Inca was anxious what was commanded by the new Lord took her, without her
é answer any thing, just drank chicha, é later that he had drunk, came down and bowed to it
and apologized. Which the new Lord replied that he did not have to forgive, that if they told
the people that he had thrown to kill him when he had gone to see that what he was well satisfied,
that that he had not done it on behalf of the city of Cuzco and of those gentlemen who were present
there, for doing his stuff as a woman, and as it was, that he ought not to drink, but in such
pots as one in which had been drinking. To which the Inca Viracocha was on the floor and tilted
his head to him, and answered from time to time they look forward
to the new Lord was saying, chocayun that says: "My cruel father!"
é "I know my sin"

[92].

É é then he roused him and brought him to his home where he sumptuously
up residence: and then ate the two together, and from then on tried
the new Lord of all honor to him pleasure and contentment.

É then gave the lords of Cuzco in order proveimiento the need for the holidays é sacrifice and
fasting that the Inca had to do, and that's the woman at the party was to receive him. ANSI fact
é É being provided, the Inca went into a room, which for was that sign, and his wife and mother
were put in another, which were fasted but that did not eat corn raw, drink chicha, ten days: and
do the same, the relatives of fasting é della, but walked around the city. By which days were the
lords of Cuzco many and great sacrifices to the idols and buried treasures that were around the
city especially in the Casa del Sol, do large sum of slaughtered cattle, sheep, lambs deer é,
é of all other animals for that party could have, very much sum of birds such as eagles, falcons,
partridges, ostriches, é of all other wild birds they may have, to ducks and other domestic fowl:
and many other animals, tigers, lions, bobcats, foxes ecepto, because with such hatred and
evil have homing instinct, that if when the holidays are like are those who yearn for understanding
in making these sacrifices, what are ominous. "Likewise were killed many children, whom buried
alive é dressed well dressed, which buried two by two, male and female: and with every other
service desto buried much gold and silver, as were plates and bowls and jars, pots and cups
for drinking, with all other duties that an Indian usually married, all of which was gold and
silver, and so he buried the children with all These outfits, which were the sons of chiefs
and principal. And while these sacrifices were made, all of the city were great rejoicings
in the town square.

And these days past, the parents of the girl é other relatives went to the Inca's taking you so
woman before him, dressed in fine clothes made of gold and fine silver, which were dressed prisoners
by the top and along the neck, with four gold pins to two feet long each, which typically weigh

é combed dressed. É as well do the Inca arrived was, of their parents and relatives prayed the
new Lord Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, who had by good woman received as such their daughter and
debt, and the new Lord, as he saw it was something that agreement and to him belongs, said the
woman so engaged or for: and then there commanded the lords of Cuzco there were that Received by
the so her mistress: and then the parents of the Lady that gave thanks, é lords of Cuzco's received
as such his Lady, to which, then there arose Viracocha Inca, father of the new Lord, and the
embrace and kissed him on one cheek, so did she é to him, and this fact, amused and donation of
certain small towns around there had their heritage. And then the Pachacutec [93] and new Lord
embrace and kissed her as his wife Women é, é offered him and gave him one hundred virgins, women
for their service: and then was carried thence to the Houses of the Sun, which made his sacrifice
there, and the sun gave her, her butler é on behalf fifty other virgins. É out there, and being
already in the houses of the Inca lords of the city you were to offer their gifts, which served
him much service of gold and silver, such as jars of gold and silver, small and large plates and
bowls é and pots and cups for drinking, And many service yanaconas, who spent more than two hundred.

And
this ANSI done, and being the finished parties, Viracocha Inca said
his son was already time will return to his people, because at parties
and rejoicing that they had done, [is had?] took three months, during
which time he had always been there.

The Pachacuti you said they were each as I liked, and being supplied by Inca Yupanqui everything
you need ANSI with supplies as quel everything else in his village had need, broke Inca Viracocha,
which begged Inca Yupanqui, which provided that parties had in Cuzco, come to find them, and
he said he would do, who, each and when that party was in the city, whenever it came to be in them.
Which Viracocha Inca, from then to ten years the coronation of Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, with
the quill in his village called Cagua Xaquixahuana [94] that is top of the village of Calca,
seven miles from the city of Cuzco, enjoying himself and rejoicing, ill with some disease, which,
in four months that ill this man Viracocha Inca died, who died when eighty years old.

Which, after death, Inca Yupanqui honored him very much, by bringing his body on a stretcher well decorated,
well ANSI as if alive, to the city of Cuzco, each é when that party had, with honor and respect
him to the lords of Cuzco and to the chiefs, ANSI good as if alive,
in front of which package to sacrifice and burn a lot of sheep lambs
é, é clothing, and maize, coca é, é pour too much chicha, saying that
such bulk ate, and that he was the son of the sun, and quest with
him in heaven.

And he made doing too many packages and many, few gentlemen had happened from Manco Capac to his
father Viracocha Inca and so he made, he issued hiciesen some very gallant wooden benches carved
and painted pintaduras where feathers were attached many different colors. And this ANSI fact
the Lord commanded that these bags were sitting in the seats together with that of his father,
whom he ordered that all honor and reverence as to idols, and that he yearns sacrifices were
made to them as such. Which were placed in their homes, and each and when some gentlemen came
to do the Inca was, they made obeisance to the sun, and then to the package, and then came
to do the Inca was and did the same.

For the slaughter of which said packages and appointed a certain amount of yanaconas é mamaconas,
and gave them that land to sow and desto cojiesen for service packages, and ansímismo said
many cattle for sacrifices that anxiously debian you do, and this service and land and cattle
gave é distributed to each package for himself and ordered that great care had continuously till
night and in the morning, to feed and drink to these packs and sacrifice,
for which command and said that they had every one of these a steward
of such servants who are anxious have said: and these stewards ansímismo
é commanded each by itself, then hiciesen songs; who sing these mamaconas
é yanaconas in praise of the facts that every one of these ANSI Lords
did in his day, which ordinarily songs all the time that parties had
sing each service order and those of its show, first starting to sing
so and history and to praise those of Manco Capac: and it craves,
whether such mamaconas é saying the service, how the Lords had happened
up there, and that this order was that they had from there later,
that memory would like that Dell and its antiquities.

Which é yanaconas Inca Yupanqui ordered service to have their homes and villages and farms in valleys
and villages around the city of Cuzco, and that they and their descendants they had Always be
careful to serve those packages, whom he had given and noted. All of which was eagerly made since
then until today, making it hidden and secret, and some groups, because the Spanish do not understand
what it is. And these are stuck in such packages horon, that are here are barns where corn é check
the other food, and some in pots and large jars, and in wall voids, and in this way they can
not bump.

Á which Inca Yupanqui sent packages when ordered craves put in the seats, they were placed on the
heads a feather headbands very Galán, from which hung a gold earrings and this ANSI fact ansímismo
verifications sent them on their foreheads, to every desto a package, some medallions of gold, and
were always two women mamaconas long red feathers in their hands and sticks tied together, with
which flies oxeasen craves [in] the packages sit down, the service which is hiciese é craves
to these [95] packages, were very clean; é é mamaconas yanaconas that each é when that front
desto lump appears to serve and revere them, é any others they might be, should come very
clean and well dressed with all cleaning é é é compliance were front bow desto such packages.
É this manner, made the Lord in this two things that caused their past were taken and adhered to
by gods, and they have memory of them; which made it understood that the same would make after
his days.

Since Inca Yupanqui saw the Lord in the order and manner and history has told you, é no longer
had to deal with building in the city, after you have loose with own, he ordered all the men of
the city of Cuzco and the other chiefs and leading came together in the square, which were
together ANSI. É still there all, said he, he had news about that city had a lot of very large
number of towns and provinces, é for him, I had strength, it was bad to live on very little, I had
thought and is ordered from that city in two months away, to seek, acquire and hold such people the
and provinces to the city of Cuzco, é remove the names that each of these peoples señorcillo
é provinces had the capacity, and have not had but only a Capac, and that it was him, and
that if the case was that walking in such a conquest, he stumbled on some man with whom he
try his hand and held him, he'd still be glad to serve him, for which he had no fear because
the sun, as Vian, was with him for that day had need of a hundred mill men of war, for those two
months they had together in the city that Cuzco, their weapons and
other proveimientos that they were necessary for this expedition.

To which they replied that they were ready to give him the people and serve as her and ansímismo
would do with their people, they begged him to get the wanted to go, é it was their willingness
to give them the space of three months, because they had need for such time to make such people.
