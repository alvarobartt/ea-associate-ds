 I
say just to procure the indulgence of even the most severe, that my purpose in writing and by gathering
the stories is as modest as innocent. I do not propose to teach anything, or moralize, or prove
thesis, or to solve problems, not blame and customs services. The only thing I set out to write
such stories is distracted or have fun in almost forced my retirement old age and my infirmities
condemn me.

I will not deny me that I had fun writing stories, but I keep it to infer and hence can be sure
that he is also fun to read. The stories, however, aspire not only to entertain. If you are
not amused, criticism can not and should go beyond to the point of calling them annoying, and
instead, if anything fun or entertaining, its purpose and aims are met. They are neither do I want
to be but a mere hobby work, when read with, without the slightest offense against God or neighbor,
to achieve the unemployed entertainment for several hours. Those who want to learn something,
have plenty of books to go. To find religion read the names of Christ, to know moral, read the Guide
sinners and to know philosophy, which is publishing the Father Urraburu
in many and very thick volumes.

This is not intended nor librejo deeply touch the hearts of readers. The muse has inspired me (assuming
also that there has been muse) has not been sad or tragic, but joyful
and happy, as suited to console of my real punishment and not to aggravate
weight with other penalties imaginary
