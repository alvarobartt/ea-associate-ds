 

We can not find the etymology of COMINT, but look the other names that we statement with the prefix
taga.

Tagabawa is the name given to the mestizo means Bagobos, Manobo and tagakaolos that by Montano,
are scattered on both sides of the gulf of Davao (Mindanao) near Son River. Bawa means "below
the bottom", referring no doubt to river because those who live upriver from the same region
are called taga-Kaol being the meaning of ka-olo, "part towards the
head, or the origin of the river."

In Mindanao, known also the tagabaloy, a name which may be a variant of tagabeli and tagabulu,
probably originated from the name of Laguna Bulu-an, but here we
would enter in the realm of hypothesis, because we lack (and I speak
personally for me), news topographic and linguists firm enough to
talk about things in Mindanao.

We know that in the language of many of those tribes in the Bagobos,
for example, taga prefix has the same meaning as in Tagalog and wider
still, because there is significance of man who possesses or has this
or that object, preceded by the prefix.

On the island of Paragua, Palawan or live on the coast Moors who came from Jolo and Mindanao
and within some indigenous idolaters, considered Aboriginal struggle with the sea and who call
themselves Tagbanuas. Banu, the voice of Polynesian origin (fenua, "land") means in most of
the Visayan languages ??"land, country and population also." Clearly Tagbanúas is understood that
means "man of the country" or in other words, "Indians." On the island of Panay was formerly called
and also tagubanua tagolabon banuanon and a god who, they said, lived in the fields and woods.
We should note that in this name see linguists two procedures: the
first is used as the Tagalog, using the affix taga, and the second
form with the suffix non Bikol has the same meaning.

Prefix I.

Almost all compounds with the kennel name I belong to most hill tribes Northern Luzon are: Ibalibon,
Ibilaw, Ifugaw, Igorots (Igolot) Ilongot, Isinay, Iraya, Italon,
Itawe.

Ilokano é Ibanag that inhabit the plains, the Ibalon in South Luzon and The Idan in Paragua.

To
find their etymologies will resort to the language spoken by the kagayanes, the Ilokano and gaddanes
that are most important to that region.

The prefix I in Ibanag, a language spoken by the indigenous civilizations that inhabited the regions
Call Cagayan and Isabela, has the same meaning as in Tagalog taga. Says P. Splendor Cave in grammar
Ibanag that 'prefixed to the names of provinces, kingdoms and towns, a patrician names: eg
Ilal-loc, Lal-loc man, I Spain, a man of Spain. "

Ibanag the same name, means "inhabitant of Banaga," which is the name of the river called Grande
de Cagayan. Originally called Ibanag to the inhabitants of the shores of that Aparry river
from which population is nearby the sea, to the region called disseminate,
and more properly from Aparri to Takalawa, a district of Lalo, to
Gataran.

Based on this principle, let us see the etymology of the other names mentioned, noting that,
as we know them today in its Spanish form, we begin by deprive them of the foreign elements that appear
in your build, to consider only an indigenous form.

The italones (italon) lived in the ancient forests that extend to the northeast tip of Pampanga,
being now in the mountains of Nueva Vizcaya and Principe. Language Gadda, heel means "mountain"
in what follows that italon means "mountain." Comes in support of this interpretation of Itaú supply
faucets, strictly itaw depriving them of the termination indicating plural is Castilian, which
is the name of some infidels living in the plains adjacent to the above. In Gadda, voice taw
means "sowing."

Iday, said Blumentritt, which is the name of a dialect of Negritos of Cagayan, however, is
but a variant called Iraya with a tribe of savages, apparently mixed the Negritos and Malays,
who live south of the Kalataganes on the western side of the mountain range Palawan. Daya,
Raya or Saya means "East" and "South" in several languages N. region of Luzon, but in this
case, refers to E. because, although we know that they are to S.
of kalataganes is not the topographical relationship to these giving
them the name but their situation with respect to the Itetapanes.

Here are some Montagnards living in the O. of Isabela de Luzon, west of the Iday and the name
says so, because in Ibanag, Telapan Tatalapan and means the 'West'. The Katalanganes are the
same men who Iraya speak the language these and its name comes from the river on whose banks they
inhabit, name which, in turn, is derived from Talang, a pine species in those sites grows in
abundance.

Commonly called Igorots the savages who inhabit the mountains of Luzon and even other islands, but
in the ancient chronicles Filipino known only to that name Igolot or rather, in true Indian form,
the infidels living in Benguet and nearby Mount Sto. Thomas. Now understood to also appoint the
bloodthirsty savages North of Luzon, but the German ethnographer Hans Meyer and then Dr. Schadenberg,
say should only be so called infidels who inhabit Benguet and Lepanto. The fact is that Tinguian
same as the voice Igorot in the Philippines is used as synonymous
with "savage mountain."

This name means the same as Tinguian 'quiet' in Tagalog root Golota, who composes, means "mountain
range" and though this voice is not the only dictionary Ibanag that form there, you can not say
why that was not known in that language, as known in ancient tinguished voice in Tagalog. It's
called a dialect spoken inibaloy by the Igorots and this voice, in Ilocano, simply means "language
of foreigners."

The so-called infidels Isinays are about living in the western part of the Nueva Vizcaya also known
by the name of Ituyes by province formerly called the county Ituy they inhabit. Its etymology
does not seem very clear: sina, in Ilocano means "segregation separation of persons' voice that
I find acceptable as a radical of the name of tribe when you consider that one of them is called
Ilongot longot formed a word that in Ilocano means "meeting, assembly, aggregation of people."

These
same Ilongots, customs and bloodthirsty savages who inhabit the regions
bordering the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela and Principe, are
also called ibilaos, (Indigenous form is ibilaw), whose etymology,
try as I have done, is for me complete darkness.

The italones that we mentioned before, are of the same tribe race: at least Dominican missionaries
say the peoples italones New High Ecija, belong to the ibilaos and these are also known by the
name of Ilongot.

Another large tribe of Malay race who lived in the mountains of Nueva Vizcaya and Isabela, is Ifugaw
call that appears to be one of the most ancient of Luzon, whose etymology
is explained the Ibanag where we see that iafugw means "island."

Today, all of that race, forming groups called silipanes, quianganes, Mayoyao and bungianes
(names topographic) have been re-concentrated to form the villages and towns of the command
of Qiang.

Is known to yogades (yogad) or to a montañeces gaddañes currently living on the slopes of the Cordillera
Central, the western boundary of the province of Isabela, from the left bank of the Magat River,
river end of the Mercedes, to the jurisdiction Christian peoples Itawes.

The etymology of both names gives us Ibanag language resembles both Gadda, resulting Gadd and
yogad that have the same meaning and origin, only the first is the name of second place and the tribe.
Both radical derived from gad ugad whose oldest form, there also in Ibanag and means "sowing high."
This root, followed by the suffix an, means "Instead of sowing high"
as we saw payaw meant "low sowing or irrigation."

The inhabitants of Gadda, called today so this place name, met in the old by personal names,
which is formed with the prefix yogad i know the meaning of which and the radical equal to gad
ugad we have examined.

Have failed my research on the etymology of other names such as some suppose ILOKO Influenced
by the analogy, derived from ilog 'dweller river, "without noting
that the radical referred to ends with g, and examined by voice k:
i also the word ilog, river, not as in ILOKO, a prefix, but an integral
part radical.

I can not say anything about Ibalon, the old name that was given to the people of Camarines.

Ilamut,
Igorot tribe that resides in the mountains located between Nueva Vizcaya and Benguet, radical
seems formed lamut Gadda, "mixture", meaning perhaps mestizo is etymology
only probable.

Iday is variable yraya already examined.

       Ilan, Illanes, lanos, wool, malanao are names given to certain people
pirates the coast of Mindanao.

Are different forms of composition of wool or lanun name radical
geographical part of that island.

* * * * *

Ma Prefix

In almost all Philippine languages ??contraction May or ma or me is a prefix meaning 'Have,
possess. " With him are adjectives.

Putian, white radical, it is maputi, "that is white ", ie white tamis matamís of having or has sweetness,"
sweet. "

There is thus an infinite number of names that have been applied after the inhabitants of Instead,
as Maguindanaw, Malanaw Mamanuas, &. &.

Maguindanaw is the indigenous name of the island of Mindanao or rather, only part of it. Its
inhabitants are called the same way. Continued Danaw, water and lagoon, and applied this name
to this region around the great lake of Danaw.

For the Moors called Illanes, Ilan Malanaw are also referred to, has the same derivation that
Maguindanaw: lanaw, danaw variant, and the voice Illan, strictly
speaking Ilan has the same i affix origin, used more in the languages
??of the north of the archipelago.

The mamanuas are some infidels who inhabit the Surigao peninsula and the shores of Lake of Mainit
(Mindanao). Fr Jaime Planas Jesuit calls them "black natives of Mindanao" view identical to that
of the Jesuit PJB Heras confirmed by the French ethnographer Mr.
Montano.

The etymology comes to corroborate this view, showing that the name of those black boys Banu
is derived from land, country; mamanua "inhabitants of the country" with a phonetic transformation
of b in m.

A mountain tribe of infidels in the interior of Mindanao, whose district is not known to me accuracy,
or mananapes mananap called in Spanish form. Language of Bagobos, mananap means "beast, animal"
thus explains the concept of these neighbors have those in the same island called Manobo, Bagobo
voice that means "man."

These Manobo are Malay and inhabit the Agusan River Basin from Moncayo to Butuan: also found
in other sites on the island mainly at Cape San Agustin in east coast of Davao and the island of
Sarangani Tumanao or the East. Also is named to the other idolatrous infidels in Mindanao, and
is easy to understand that this term embraces distant tribes to be so widespread and attending
to what it really means.

The Jesuit Father Pastells talks about mangu called infidels living in or mangulangan the proximity
of Cateel (Mindanao) and the upper river Salug. Its name means "men or inhabitants of the jungle.
"

       

A faithless people inside the island of Mindoro are called Manguianes.

In Tagalog, Bicol and Visayan, Manguier means "savage, wild, black infidels", so that the use of
this word is common to a great number of Filipinos, but, however, has only been applied to certain
inhabitants of Mindoro. Originally, no doubt, the name was given only to the that today carry
on that island, but its use in three Philippine languages ??shows
that ngian radical in all these languages ??have a sense now forgotten.

Still exists in Pampanga this radical and means "old", so that we
can deduce that is name mangia applied to men considered old settlers
and as such pushed into by modern invaders in their own language were
called "old."

As it turned out later that newcomers were or were more civilized than the vanquished pushed
into or to the mountains, consider these as feral or wild and appeal made by former extension of this
new meaning. So it is with the voice Tagbanúas, whose etymology we have clarified, "Natural country",
that being the name of infidel Rangers today means "savages Paragua "simply because the idea
of ??'wild' replaces the old meaning voice that was lost with many others.

* * * * *

Ka affix and suffix W

It is common to almost all Philippine languages ??form adjectives
and nouns with the procedure prefixed to the root of the prefix ka
and postpone an.

Names regularly and compounds are referring to place and these have been applied after its inhabitants.
This is true Cagayan, Kalagan, Kalibugan, Katalangan, Katubagan and many others.

Other ways.

Just as we have seen the names applied indiscriminately Tinguian Igorot
and the Infidels that inhabit the mountains, so we found in northern
Luzon as usually the name Kalinga applied to the mountain people of
that region, we read in the writings of the friars report them with
the voice of the Calinguismo.

Some tribes are given to each other and the name of Kalinga The reason is simple: in almost all
those dialects SIGIF "enemy", and as the main occupation of these savages is a constant struggle
of one tribe to another is clear that all called with the same voice:
"enemy", Kalinga.

Non suffix used in Bicol and Visayan as taga also in Tagalog, and so we called buquidnon to a Malay
race infidels who inhabit the eastern tip of the district of Misamis and the Spanish call wild
is really the translation of that name filipino lead. Farmers are being called in Visayan banuahanon
Banu, "land, country."

The Mindanao tirurays call themselves etew rootor, "people upstairs"

(the river), etew dawa 'people down, "the plain, the slopes of the rivers, etew dogot," seafarer
" the coast and etew tuduk, the Highlanders.

The lack of vocabulary of all Filipino dialects I can fruitfully follow full etymological study of the
names of races or tribes, but with this we see that all have the same or identical training.

In Cagayan, live in the nearby mountains and Tubang Naksiping a peaceful infidels called ARIPO.
Removing the final s, which is Spanish plural, is aripa that means Ibanag "Slave."

Researching the etymology of ita, Aeta or tie, names that are in various
Philippine languages the so-called Negroes, has taken the dream to
many ethnographic been busy these interesting island.

A missionary priest said the voice meant "up at the top" and referring to the room chosen by the
blacks on the heights of the mountains.

No say today that this explanation is not founded, but also remember
that others explain their etymology itam warning that means "black
color" in Malay, and as the blacks have right to a name with this
meaning, it appears that no objection to this etymology am what it
means and I so it's worth, the same as the other.

The bold or their crossbred living Porak, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Angeles
and Kapas, receive Baluga name, voice in Pampanga means "mestizo."

Typographical
errors, the ignorance of some writers and other similar cases have
swelled the list of names of tribes in the Philippines, creating new
difficulties to explain its etymology. What matters is not to differentiate
the names of tribes that are not based on reason identity of language:
the groups characterized by the use of the same dialect must be known
by one name and form distinctive ethnographic studies after a base
as strong as the anthropological measurable, it is necessary to form
vocabularies of their languages ??and establish its mechanism or is
your grammar.
