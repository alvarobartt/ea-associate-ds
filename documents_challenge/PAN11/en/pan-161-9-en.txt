  the prospect of the glory that has immortalized by a guide: he
  knew where he was going: the simple sailors who accompanied him,
  no, no beaches that were more familiar of Spain, could not even
  dream of the existence of another world were seen thrown at a
  company that unnerving to all, that Europe all described as madness,
