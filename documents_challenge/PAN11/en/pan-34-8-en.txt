my uncle, had hoped to make health care because he already had another son, the eldest, studying
law at Valladolid. To him, studying third degree in Santander, did the same thing. He felt
no aversion or attachment to any literary or scientific career: all their five senses was placed
on the home turf. This did not tell anyone, but I felt very deeply. On this side had been glad
to career choices made by his father, because the doctor was perhaps the only one compatible
with their aspirations and trends. Furthermore, it could fool you into illusions of boys, and of all

What we have is that these treats, not dislike, I met, I filled, and always left me awake appetite
of nothing but the taste of my taste.

- And what was that thing, may I ask?

- It's here, the native land.

- But what the hell can you find in it in palatable to that point! - I cried then, truly amazed.

-
What's missing in the other - he answered instantly.

- I do not get it - concluded.

- Neither is easy - I said very quietly - from the point of view of
you, so different mine.

- Different - added - according to and under,
for, after all, this is a man who has seen the world than a hole,
hence my surprise precisely.
