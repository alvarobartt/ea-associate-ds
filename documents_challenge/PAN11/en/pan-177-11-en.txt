the archives, we know that in the Middle Ages artists were here notables whose works are lost;
many references, or descriptions of what they did and even in some cases there is the amount that
they received in payment, but the truth is since Don Lazaro Diaz del Valle and Cean Bermudez
until today, few writers have tried to clarify the origins of our painting have done because
they could do nothing thing, rather than shuffling a few hundred names and repeat the same
news. There are many proactively ensure that artists were at that time know where habilis although
learned, how they began to form, and how various trends or ideals inspired. The only thing certain
