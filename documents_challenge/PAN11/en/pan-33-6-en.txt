 And this fact,
will lower the novel and its relatives as the guaca, and come on to the city and bring novel that
straw, and erect, hands: and being anxiously in the city, the novel wear a T-shirt colorful and with
a white list of bottom-up by the shirt, with some flocadura according to the top of the shirt,
and put it on his head a red ribbon with a list of any color, and ANSI standard, descapulario
put it that way in the back, and from there, go to a morning guaca I point out, which is called
Anaguarque and arrivals there, make their sacrifice by giving some chicha and before her a
fire, fire which offered some coca é corn and tallow: and when anxiously outside, relatives
carried this novel, which sponsors almost want to imitate, some big and tall halberds of gold
and silver and now the sacrifice made, tie at the top, in the irons WITH THESE halberds, that straw
in the eager hands are hanging [of] such iron wool that hangs ANSI straw, and being tied ANSI
and this straw, give each of his novel a halberd WITH THESE in their hands, and this has already
been done, to all these novel júntenlos there shall be found and send them From there they ran all
together with their halberds in their hands, as well ANSI were following range of enemies, and
this is from the guaca run up a hill do it seems this city, [t] are there in this site, to
see true and [safe?] how come these gentlemen novice run, and who is he that will END the first
run, and this honor it as their own and give some thing and say that he did as good orejon, é Give
him Guaman surname, which says "hawk", and these such that anxiously extremaren when dried
apricots were made, are known, when the city of Cuzco hath war, rise to the Penoles, as lighter,
é fight with enemies.

And the next day out of the city, and I point out another guaca ansímismo,
which will be called guaca Yavir, which will be the idol of the grant:
and when he is in it, do make a big fire offer to this guaca é é é
sun these sheep lambs, first by slitting their throats, blood which
will be made a mark with great reverence for faces, as it takes to
ear to ear, and offer ansímismo to this fire much corn and coca, which
is made all with great reverence and observance, offering the sun,
and asked where these newcomers, é each for himself, which will increase
prosperity and their cattle, and the look and free from any evil comes
your way.

And it finished, he will be sworn each for himself, before the idol, ternate always careful
to comply with and revere the sun and worked their land, and be obedient to the Inca and always
treat you right and be loyal vassals and not treat treason é that each and when you know that
makes it treason to some Inca, demonstrations and tell him; é that the same will be loyal
to the city of Cuzco, and that each and when the Inca is at war or the city of Cuzco, who
served with his services, and weapons in this war, and who will die Dell and the Inca defense.

And
this jury, the man who abide in the guaca there, before whom the oath so, he will answer in name and
place of the sun and of the idol, who thanks him, and that he craves the right: and that say
that the sun has by property that is auqui [52], which says "gentleman." And this fact, that
such render thanks for this novel around the sun, and then you wear a shirt there too painted
and you put a blanket very painted over, all of which is fine clothes, and hang him ears a
large gold earrings dangling, tied with red thread, and to put a scallop of large golden breasts,
and shoes that fit cattail, put it é head very painted tape, called Pillaca llaut, that you
put tape over Desta a paten of gold, and until there's no waiter
may get, and that if that thing be there forget to put it, was never
able to put in their days.

And this fact, the market tends arms to this novel, é those relatives who go there with him as
sponsors, getting some stripes on the arms with a deep, that you remember and has memory The
oath that there does and worship that she was done. And this fact, ANSI fall together to the
square of this city, I long dresses and adorned as we were, where they will find them all the
lords of Cuzco dresses a long and colorful shirts to give them to their feet, which they have
on their heads mesmos [skins of lions with their faces] [53], and the faces desto lions have in
film speak [54] of his own, which have lion heads ansímismo golden ears: and ansímismo have to
have these gentlemen get on the square ANSI are four drums of gold.

É as novices get into the place, get in the wing to the bottom, the faces towards do the sun rises,
and since has looked forward, knelt halberds craves bring on the floor, each one before him.
And as this is done, the gentlemen who are there, begin their singing and touch the drums,
and after having sung and holgádose, sit in a line as long for all are, and drink every two glasses
of chicha and two ansímismo offered to the sun, spilling before their halberds, and dende little,
get up and sing around her, in which song have to give great praise to the sun and beg his people
and to save and increase his novel; and this song ended, he relapsed into drinking. And this have
to do thirty days from the day you start .-- Y every night in this way are snug chicha, because
their main joy in all their works and things to do, it's okay to drink, and the more drink,
more, sir, because they opportunity to do so.

É ordered these thirty days of age, came together in the square where relatives desto the junior
novels and a favorable answer it there, kneeling E halberd, and when they were in standing, with
hands tomasen the halberd, and so he, stretched out his arms, family members should give them
with a sling on them, that they might report were agreed Desta é party, and that this fact
there were a source to say Calixpucquiu [55], which says "the source of Calix [56] and being
already there, to wash all, to which source they want to go as dark. É ANSI being washed, Hansen wear
other shirts precious, and so they dressed, their relatives stone them with a prickly pear [57],
and every parent, I long as I have stoned with the tunas, they are obliged to provide such novel
certain pieces of jewelry and clothing, and give him ansímismo, desto
finally, to every one of this novel, a sling.

And this is done, every one of these novel must return to his house, whose house is to find
very clean, and very good fire made in it and all their relatives and relatives in it, and
then have to take the four pitchers of chicha they did in the beginning of the feast, which pitchers
have to drink all, and this novel have such imbriagar with chicha so that no [58] makes sense, and
as soon and this longing, hanle to take the room, and where they best they seem good, there shall
bore ears. And tomorrow's another day, go all the novice to the place all together in order
While fighting and ANSI as if to give battle, with their slings in their hands and necks to
bags of networks, which bring many Chinese, and put out as much of a another in the plaza, begin
to battle, which must give battle to the end that they need to understand craves have to fight with
their enemies. In this manner I think it must be these cirimonias, and on this art ordered
triple [in] doing the apricots and not what has been hitherto.

Heard by the Lords what he had ordered Inca Yupanqui, said that was fine ordered and thought,
so there were being put to forward, and to tell them that since when I wanted to begin this party?
He told them that there could be thirty days to begin because that's where do we begin the month
of the year was beginning, and they begged him that because so there had been no order to do
knew the year and the months that had [for good?] signals and the recital of which begun, and the
names of those months. And Ynca I replied that that party after the sun, he had thought of
giving in that order; more, because they invited him to the charms and signs (and) that he wanted
to do that grace: and that at present there was no place for them to account for this, because I thought
identify and sort such months in the other parties in that they all
rejoice é hiciesen their sacrifices, that from thence to ten days,
I would say that the order that had to have é parties they were to
gay and sacrifices that had to ANSI.

And that said, out of their agreement he and the other gentlemen, which were each to his inn,
where began to give orders to their parties, which have heard that from then to thirty days
were to start, which thirty days ago, made his party the way they have heard; dende and then
I continued to do in the way and that, until this year we are of fifteen hundred and fifty-one
years .-- The party and the other that the Lord established, although the wish to remove in this
city of Cuzco, the often hidden or secret they do in villages which are surrounding the city
of Cuzco.

After that were the ten days Inca Yupanqui Messrs. said that after those came together with him
again, which together had to tell them the order that they asked ANSI that would make the year
and months and the more parties that they had to have and keep, Inca Yupanqui told them he
had many years he had imagined the months and time of year, which had found that they were twelve
and I did not think saying a desto twelve months and times thing, but it was good as were going
ANSI and such parties that they had them He was to pose, but because they had asked, he wanted
to ask what (So) and say and declare the parties and the sacrifices that those months were
to ANSI do, they were attentive and the tomasen firmly in mind, that besides this, I look
forward mesmo I had thought of doing a certain thing he called Pachaunanchango, which means "knower
time "[59] - we can presume Relox - by which they and their descendants, and they lost track of the
months, you would understand when the time of sowing, labor é, é
dressing their land.

And ANSI, the lords being attentive, Inca Yupanqui said unto them this coming month, in which
have to make the pears, as I have told you, that's where the year begins, we shall call and
has called Pucuy quillaimi [60], which is our December, and January called Coyquis has time,
and one month called Ccollappoccoyquis Hebrero [61] and the March call Pachapoccoyquis [62] and
as of April Ayrihuaquis [63] and the month of May called Aymorayquis Keel [64]. In this month was
ordered é Inca Yupanqui that it should be another party in the sun very solene, in which hiciesen
great sacrifices in order to quel the earth had given them and corn that she had, and that
since then began to fuck their maize, were to begin the party and last until at the end of June,
and that in the month of June, which called Hatun cosqui quillan, than in December last year
were ordered apricots in aquesta party constituted in the month of June, to dress shirts woven
of gold and silver and iridescent feathers, and can not wait posts
patens é their feathers and gold bracelets, saliesen to this feast,
and that at this event should give an end to their fasting and sacrifices,
since they were sorted apricots until there had been, and there began
to rejoice and celebrate another constituted craves to be had by Simentera
sun, to which party ANSI starting from May until late June, as we
have heard, called and appointed Yahuarincha aymoray [65].

Which sent party that was done in the square is the agora do espital in Cuzco, which is at the
outlet of this city, do call Rimacpampa, to which party had Messrs. dresses out of the city of a red
shirt that gave up feet, in which party ordered it hiciesen great sacrifices to idols, do they
burn many cattle slaughtered é é é food clothing, and in such guacas were offered many gold
and silver jewelry.

As of July was called Cahuarquis [66], which ordered that no party will do him no, most of them
said this month they were to irrigate their land, were to begin é plant their corn and potatoes
and quinoa [67] until the month of September came out é, and August Capacsiquis called [68],
and the month of September called Cituaiquis [69]. This month say that it was Inca Yupanqui hiciesen
two parties, one almost wants to look to which we do in San Juan, because they rise at midnight
and washed until rie day, and have some torches lit, and after being washed, these torches danse in
the back, and throw himself say that any ill health and bad they have. É the other party is [T]
he called the Inca Yupanqui Purappucquiu [70], [é] é ansímismo sent the to do this month, which
he commanded that they should do to the water, the hiciesen E ansímismo sacrifices and these sacrifices
commanded that offered a lot of clothes and sheep and coca, and that in any few herbs and plants that
were in the fields, flowers Dellas favorable answer, all of which commanded offered the waters
in this way: them to take plenty of clothes and cast them in that River of Cuzco in the do the two
rivers meet, that many sheep and a favorable answer ansímismo lamb and to offer them water,
and decapitated in that place do the clothes were cast, and then that would make a great fire there
which burnt these sheep and lambs, the ciniza é of those eager burned, cast into the water at
that very site, and then after that, cast into the river and the
flowers have heard: and after this, he cast them into the water that
lot of ground coca é shredded.

And after that was coming down when the sun set [71], in a site, which was sure standing in a part
where it could be good to see, and so they like knew from that site do it stop, the course
would do when the sun was coming down in that right at the top of the hills, make four pyramids
made of stone or marble, amid the two smaller than the other two sides, and two states altor
each pictures, and section one another a fathom, except that the two small middle became more
together, one to the other half will breaststroke. And when the sun came out, still do a job
Inca Yupanqui stopped to watch and gauge this right, gets out and is on the right and middle
desto two pillars, and when it sets, the same thing, do the turns, through which the common
people I was understanding that it was time, I look forward to planting, as to catch, because
the clocks were four to do the sun came out, and four to do was setting the course do not differ
and movements so the sun does in the year. Erros the Inca Yupanqui in the month to take to come
to one and to our mind the months of the year that craves said, because he took December January
having to make, but at last he learned to understand and give orders to his republic.

After they had done é Inca Yupanqui given orders in the year and months and festivals that he
were to hold, and made clocks, recreating and having loose on the things that you have heard time
and space of two years, which the Lord spent time to stand on its people, because natural and chiefs
who were subject to him they had space and time to idle work on their land that had been in
the repair craves had done in streams the city of Cuzco, they had space because they desired
é é é take time to plant large fields, with which they repaired all meals and provision, with
which they had é to serve and contribute to the city of Cuzco and to the deposits in it were,
it seems rescibia already his services, and any other penalty for both ANSI had idleness he and
others ajuntóse a day with the main city of Cuzco and said unto them already had idleness that
seemed that it was time for the caciques and gentlemen at subjectively should come with their
meals and supplies to the city of Cuzco and bring him all the more people could be, because
he had agreed to make themselves rebuild the city of Cuzco in such a way that was perpetually made
and manufactured in certain buildings he yes I had thought, and that after they were made,
they would see, for which it was necessary lot of very large numbers of people, and that this
was necessary to depart from the city certain gentlemen of the people there on that board with him
were: and then they saw that there wanted to go, because, with those remaining, he had need,
while those who had to go were, of what we do and provide for such a building necessary. É then there
were appointed ten lords, twenty apricots, which departed from there
and were then to the towns and provinces and provide them to bring
what we have heard.
