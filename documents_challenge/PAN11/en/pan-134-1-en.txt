 Did I, gaznápiro, di?

...

He was holding his arm, and each of these sentences was accompanied by a strong jolt. When he
had finished his invective, he left her crying in the corner and
went behind Eulalia who had climbed back to the room to ascertain
the number and kind of havoc executed there.

Meanwhile, D. Bernardo, a very bad mood, not so much by his son's
mischief improprieties by his wife, served soup to everyone at the
table, filling also it's plate and his daughter away.

Upon arrival at Henry said in a peremptory tone:

- Kid, come sit
at the table.

But Henry was Swedish and continued moaning and kicking at times.

- Child! - Shouted D. Bernardo stentorian voice .-- Come now sit at the table!

The boy raised his head and looking frightened father who was staring
him with a terrible expression of anger, began to walk and dragged
reluctantly to the table.

And perhaps it would have reached safely if he did not see the time appear the door to the cause
of the cuffs, Eulalia, who entered the room followed of his mother.

See and feel possessed by insane rage was all one.

- Indecent! I have attached for you! I'll pay all together, recontra! ... I Te Nose trumpet
break them! Metebaza! ... Fea! ... Feona! ... Chula! ...

At being insulted in this way could not help Eulalia jumped like a
beast on his brother, giving this spurt of hair, the wail of Henry,
to feel, did rise again afraid to present.

Dona Martina, that despite his antics had decided passion by him and that was half sorry for
having punished, outraged.

- Listen, fool! Who are you to beat your brother? Are not we here your father and I for that?
Wait, wait a bit, and I will humble myself down ...!

And he turned to his daughter with his hand up, this cautious young man had gone wrong not to
put in safe running around the table, Mrs. Martin could not catch it: at the same time, so
that Colonel Ojeda, sought to make peace.

D. Bernardo was so irritated with tosquedades his wife, who could not say or do nothing, continued
to sit staring at the plate while a swarm of thoughts dark and melancholy associated with
their unequal marriage, he seethed in the head.

Finally, they went slowly calming the spirits who were angry. Doña Martina left to pursue her
daughter and sat at the table, though muttering threats, it also sat looking askance at his mother,
D. Bernardo, making a prodigious effort of diplomacy to overcome its just despondency, fell
into conversation with the colonel. The only broken glass was paid miserly Henry: the authority of the
father and mother, in common agreement, decided to stay without food, for insolence! But, as long
as in Spain punishes a criminal, no lack of commitment to continue to have the case married,
the pleas of Ojeda and Colonel managed to end that sentence was reduced only deprivation dessert.
And the good Henry (who must at least acknowledge that in the midst of raging anger sacase
not the shovel murderer who was in the lining of the jacket) came to sit at the table with
the red cheeks of the cheeks, eyes and noses wet hair fallen over his forehead. I was so horrible,
that his cousin Miguel, pity heartily, he felt a desire heinous laugh
which, of course, tried to contain by whatever means were within reach,
biting his lips, looking at another site, etc., etc. But he wanted
her bad luck that Henry came to understand, by the contraction of
the face certainly, the desire that frolicked in the body, and for
that purpose began to throw a glaring, poisoned.

Michael then was no longer master of himself, and suddenly, in a
moment of silence, let the cloth of laughter, and with him by the
mouth and nose chorretazos the spoonful of soup she had just swallowed.

All faces turned in surprise.

- What are you laughing at, Michael? - Asked his aunt.

- Me, recontra, on me - Enrique shouted desperately.

- Come, silence!
- Dona Martina said face severe with him .-- Do you feel like take
them again?

Miguel does not laugh at you ... Why was laughing, sappy? ...
- Why yes ... I well know ... Because he is a hypocrite! ...

- Silence,
I say ... and eat!

Miguel had been very seriously, realizing that
he had committed a rudeness, and that the concealed by being invited
