 

[224.] In this case, the question is: does a pure spirit can have those representations and conditions
of various kinds, which we call sensitive?

Since then jumps to the eyes that simplicity is not opposed to the sensitive faculty: our soul
feels, however that is simple. In the exercise of the sensitive faculties, the helps the body, but
this help is instrumental, and so not feel the body, as an action exerted through an instrument:
he feels is the very soul, and instrumental action of the body is reduced to place certain conditions,
which is the feeling, influenced by physical or casual. Then the simplicity of a pure spirit
nothing evidence against the possibility of the sensitive faculties: such an argument would prove
too much; and therefore proves nothing.

[225.] From this it follows that there is no intrinsic repugnance
that God communicates to a pure spirit sensitive faculties, whether
of representation, such as those in which we offers the corporeal
world, and are purely subjective, such as pleasure or pain.

[226.] Although these functions in the current order, dependent on certain conditions to which
they are subject the bodies, however, considered in itself, as are a modification of the soul, present
no essential relationship with the corporeal world. It seems then
that would be contrary to the principles of sound philosophy, to say
that the disembodied soul can not experience conditions similar to
those felt while it is in this life
