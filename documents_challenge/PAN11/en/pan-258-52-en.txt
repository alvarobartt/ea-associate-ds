 Given in the town of Tupiza, to March 20, 1781. "

JOSE Reseguin.

Produced this diligence, all favorable effects were expected, because with unspeakable diligence
were many Indian leaders, representing their people, to ensure Commander his most constant resolution
to remain loyal, so that in such a short time the province was entirely peaceful, and without the
immediate suspicion that waiting impatiently the arrival of the troops, to the same tests
and demonstrations of loyalty. Became to work the mines, and journeyed through the streets
and roads without care, he sent la Plata and Potosi the portmanteau of correspondence from the
public, who was arrested in Mojo, and everything went back to take the order after the rebels,
and after some arrangements governance and caution, Reseguin was moving again, the 5th of
April 1781, for the people of Santiago de Cotagaita, where he had done to advance to captain
Savoy infantry, D. Joaquin Salgado, with 50 men to hold that neighborhood, and encourage their militiamen
who had the glorious determination to stay loyal and counteract efforts and persuasions of the rebels,
whose heroic action becomes entitled to a perpetual memory.

Reseguin used only two days on the road, however the league is 18, and be undertaken a strong tertian,
whose accident suffered more than a third of the soldiers and nearly all the officers, neither
of which was an obstacle for him to stop immediately substantiate causes more than 80 inmates who were
in those prisons, learned at the outputs who had made those loyal militia, among whom were some major
heads the conspiracy of the province of Lipes, complicit in the death of their mayor, D. Francisco
Revilla, whom they examined and justified his crimes, was sentenced eleven to death penalty and
the other to prison. Among the first occurred suceoo has a lot of miraculous. One of them,
guilty of two deaths, and in the tumultuous confusion of the doctrine of Tatasi had taken
and abused his priest inside the church, with heavy blows, and several Sometimes he had put
the knife to slay his throat, was found dead the day had been verified in his person the last
ordeal, what part was given immediately Commander, who the evening before he had made the statement,
without notice you indisposition a: and believing that the accident was born of desperation or
some effect of neglect, sent you recognize, what egecutado, they found the arm and hand which
had committed sacrilege, completely emaciated to the bone, as if a skeleton of many years, and
the sleeve of his jacket full of worms: all that aware Reseguin, decided to crash by hanging
and the priest explain the numerous competition was present, the origin and the causes of
that wonder.

Criminal matters concluded, cared Reseguin meaning to the loyal inhabitants of Cotagaita This
would make the Sovereign his loyalty purge, and exhorted them to continue their good intentions,
thanking them on behalf of the King for his distinguished services: which accounted for those
neighbors, along with other Spanish Tupiza and who had delivered throughout the province with the
most expressive demonstration of respectful gratitude hailed their deliverer, and offering direct to
the Almighty the most solemn vows for the happiness of whom I had returned to the peaceful possession
of their former homes and farms. But fearing even those tensions, which had not yet convalesced the
terrifying horror that led in their hearts the ravages and cruelties of tyrants, I led a representation,
for it to stop, which is expressed as follows: -

Representation.

"Officials, residents and inhabitants of this province, and to consider fairly tax VS the sorry
state that have constituted the riots, murders and robberies of Indians some unknowns, have
been introduced in several parishes of this jurisdiction, shedding seditious letters, publishing
edicts and orders, on behalf of the principal rebel José Gabriel Tupac-Amaru: reaching the audacity
of these, to planting nooses in point Stencil, to execute on them to all that, as loyal subjects
and good servers of our legitimate sovereign, not adhere to the ideas of the head of rebellion,
which know at first sight, there are others who yearn for the subversion
of this kingdom, and placed violently in the possession of it.

"But even to the understanding of VS none of this is covered up, news of the patient being egecutar
next gear that meets at the city of La Plata, leaving the province, which is the rampart and
accurate entry of Peru, abandoned to the discretion esponse of the enemy, that minerals located
in the towns of Ubinas, Chocalla, Tatasi, Esmoraca, Santa Catalina, La Rinconada, Lipes and Atacama,
after having killed the judges and leading citizens of these peoples, remain vigilant, waiting
for VS to withdraw the troops under his command, to enter with fire and blood in this town and
elsewhere in the province, making victims rigor, we find it necessary, as good stewards and
faithful subjects of the King Our Lord, represent VS, which is their obligation to protect with
the arms of the sovereign is province, otherwise, the real incomes of tobacco, sales taxes and
e, are watched abandoned, its directors ESPONSE TO loss of life, or put to flight, as also all
loyal, who found without any defense, lack of weapons and ammunition necessary, to join the
army and come into season, we will need to abandon our beautiful homes and property, to preserve
life, however, that the zeal of honor of God, and defend the SM domains, we need to stand firm
containing the raids by the rebels, to lose the last drop of blood. But look at us defenseless and
natural right to preserve the life we ??lead, not to separate us from the service of His Majesty,
and yes to leave the province, leaving refiners and work egercicio of mine, that it will benefit
both the royal treasury, and included in VS troop command, way to their destination, where
the most refiner give proof of our fidelity and love the Sovereign.

"The damage from VS to leave this province, it is his Majesty, for all events is well known as
the branch of taxes is lost annually more than 20.000 pesos, and the fifths and bouquets for
the work of gold and silver mines, up from 50.000 pesos: and regard to branch sales taxes, tobacco
revenue and emails, rather considerable amount pesos. So, so in the reimbursement of real estate,
as in that of individuals faithful to SM will be harmed by more than a million pesos annually,
and is not under consideration, the VS be aware that, should this be the transit, through which
the Mail Buenos Aires to Peru, and wherever located is conducted for the city of Buenos Aires,
and that all trade in the provinces of the earth: so that, this is the only accurate door to
intern all of Peru, because we also have to conduct of food aid to the streets of Potosi and
Chuquisaca, which abandoned this province, were under siege, completely exposed to starvation
to surrender to the enemy.

"The mind of His Excellency. Viceroy Lord must not persuade us that is precisely what VS present
in Chuquisaca, having first a need for greater attention to be remedied, because for these
cases, which are not prevented, we believe given the necessary powers to VS to operate according
to his wise knowledge and military skill had fit.

"Zeal for the honor of God, and worship of the holy religion we profess, is one of the VS items
that should fix the attention, it is noteworthy that the Indian rebels, unabashedly to the sacred
temples and ministers of Jesus Christ, to be thrown to the profanation intrepid of them, as
they have in that town egecutado Chocalla, slaying in the same Don Church Francisco Javier Carbonell,
and this in Tupiza, removing the corpse from the grave the mayor, and cut off his head, and in the
Tatasi seized the priest of that doctrine, and having him on his knees, threatened with a knife
his throat, until by dint of prayers and cries got to let him live, having summoned out of exile to
that doctrine formal, and do not administer the spiritual nourishment
to his parishioners.

"We as infallible immediately to his departure, more bitter the minds of the rebels, following
policies harmful to rise on command, subdue this province, and pregnancy all traffic from it: but
do not doubt that taken care of serious matters VS you need to stay in this province, until
further order of His Excellency. Viceroy Lord, stop the resolution of his motion, or at least
verify if, leave a detachment of troops veteran to guard this jurisdiction, with whose support it
will not be difficult, to the chiefs of this province, the military maintain the best foot,
obedience and service of the sovereign. But if you disregard our strong representation and
causes that we present, abandon, at any time will not be responsible to the King or God of the
loss of this province and abandonment of religion, leaving us with a transfer to this, if necessary
to the Sovereign and Lord Viceroy, which we have fulfilled our part that we are obliged and protest
to make VS responsible for all damages that you continue to SM to
abandon it, keeping it on the day under its protection.

"Our Lord preserve you many years. Tupiza, and March 17, 1781."

Commandant General D. José Reseguin.

Reseguin answered her verbally in the most benign and effective for comfort, and despite their
small number of troops, determined to leave D. Joaquin Soria, Lieutenant infantry regiment of Savoy,
accredited official spirit and conduct, with 25 veterans and Salta: detachment that seemed enough,
and to reassure them, to sustain The expedition, which had prepared those own militias entered
the province Lipes, with a view to prisoners to the main heads of this survey, free the wife of
the late mayor, who still held prisoner, dressed in their use, and in service one of the major
Indian and also to finally secure the peace of those natural disturbances whose hands were
given the province of Porco, which gave rise in Yora, drank and other towns, some restless
spirits, which gave no little care and disclose to the imperial villa of Potosi, that he was
often threatened with being overrun by those insurgents, whose fears were taking greater increase
for military incompetence natural and judicial robes in a Governor, who startled and precavia
more than what was necessary, to the threats directed at her daily rebels in order to keep continuous
allowance until the successful operations Reseguin all misgivings were calm, as it expresses
the same Governor D. Jorge Escobedo, in a letter dated April 9, 1781, in which Minister says
that: "I trust the quiet is restored in these places, because it seems expressed fear that
the first steps has given you: for yesterday, there were other letters that intercede for them
is asking for forgiveness, and drank at this hour may be imprisoned major. "These and other news,
it acquired the Commander assured him good state they were in that immediate and provinces, and
considering them as free from infection that they had introduced a measure of the rebels, determined
to set out the 11th of that month of April, without waiting for the departure of the expedition
of Lipes, by care later called their attention. But it did not take long to know, had had the happiest
success; fulfilled exactly as he had warned in the instructions Don left Antolin of Chabarri,
and whom she appointed Commander and militias Cotagaita Santiago, who led this operation correctly,
playing time all orders that are entrusted.

Reseguin continued marches, forcing allowed him as his weakness, and the many patients who had,
struggled to overcome the difficulties that befell him on this occasion, they were repeated
in all instances that made him sometimes D. Ignacio Flores, for to get closer to the Plata.
Traffic peoples took great pains to give further evidence Loyalty, welcomes you with the most
expressive shows that allowed them the unhappy constitution that had been shortly before. They had
arranged accommodation, the food ready and baggage requirements: be exceeded in the care of
the sick, went out to meet long Indian distance governors, with their second and curacas, with
dancing and music to use, to demonstrate the ease and complacency with which he received: so
that seemed not that country had been any alteration. These circumstances gave him the satisfaction
Silver reached the 19 day of that month, where he entered through the cheers a large village,
accompanied by that commander, and all the officers of militia and many people in the first
distinction, who had come to receive this small number men, covered with laurels, and immortal
glory, I could not delete the course time, nor obscure the dark shadows of envy.

The continued repeated warnings that he received on the way D. Cristoval Lopez, the gigantic
body that took the revolt in the provinces of the Sierra, I did rush gear he could, and being already
in the vicinity of Salta to the troops under his command, took orders Colonel D. Andres Mestre,
governor of Tucuman, so that with all the possible acceleration approaches, considering that 300
men of the militia of that government, intended to serve in Peru, had lost their obedience
to their commander and officers who maneater in search of him back home gift. And also because
I knew that the Indians Toba, allied with the vicinity of the city of Jujuy, trying to invade
and plunder.
