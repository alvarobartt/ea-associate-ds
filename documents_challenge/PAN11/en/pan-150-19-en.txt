 And as this is done, the gentlemen who are there, begin their singing and
touch the drums, and after having sung and holgádose, sit in a line as long for all are, and drink
every two glasses of chicha and two ansímismo offered to the sun, spilling before their halberds,
and dende little, get up and sing around her, in which song have to give great praise to the
sun and beg his people and to save and increase his novel; and this song ended, he relapsed
into drinking. And this have to do thirty days from the day you start .-- Y every night in this way are
snug chicha, because their main joy in all their works and things to do, it's okay to drink,
and the more drink, more, sir, because they opportunity to do so.

É ordered these thirty days of age, came together in the square where relatives desto the junior
novels and a favorable answer it there, kneeling E halberd, and when they were in standing,
with hands tomasen the halberd, and so he, stretched out his arms, family members should give
them with a sling on them, that they might report were agreed Desta é party, and that this fact
there were a source to say Calixpucquiu [55], which says "the source of Calix [56] and being already
there, to wash all, to which source they want to go as dark. É ANSI being washed, Hansen wear
other shirts precious, and so they dressed, their relatives stone them with a prickly pear [57],
and every parent, I long as I have stoned with the tunas, they are obliged to provide such novel
certain pieces of jewelry and clothing, and give him ansímismo, desto finally, to every one of this
novel, a sling. And this is done, every one of these novel must return to his house, whose
house is to find very clean, and very good fire made in it and all their relatives and relatives
in it, and then have to take the four pitchers of chicha they did in the beginning of the feast,
which pitchers have to drink all, and this novel have such imbriagar with chicha so that no
[58] makes sense, and as soon and this longing, hanle to take the room, and where they best they
seem good, there shall bore ears. And tomorrow's another day, go all the novice to the place
all together in order While fighting and ANSI as if to give battle, with their slings in their
hands and necks to bags of networks, which bring many Chinese, and put out as much of a another
in the plaza, begin to battle, which must give battle to the end that they need to understand
craves have to fight with their enemies. In this manner I think it must be these cirimonias, and on
this art ordered triple [in] doing the apricots and not what has been hitherto.

Heard by the Lords what he had ordered Inca Yupanqui, said that was fine ordered and thought,
so there were being put to forward, and to tell them that since when I wanted to begin this
party? He told them that there could be thirty days to begin because that's where do we begin
the month of the year was beginning, and they begged him that because so there had been no order
to do knew the year and the months that had [for good?] signals and the recital of which begun,
and the names of those months. And Ynca I replied that that party after the sun, he had thought
of giving in that order; more, because they invited him to the charms and signs (and) that he wanted
to do that grace: and that at present there was no place for them to account for this, because
I thought identify and sort such months in the other parties in that they all rejoice é hiciesen
their sacrifices, that from thence to ten days, I would say that the order that had to have é parties
they were to gay and sacrifices that had to ANSI. And that said, out of their agreement he
and the other gentlemen, which were each to his inn, where began to give orders to their parties,
which have heard that from then to thirty days were to start, which thirty days ago, made his party
the way they have heard; dende and then I continued to do in the way and that, until this year
we are of fifteen hundred and fifty-one years .-- The party and the other that the Lord established,
although the wish to remove in this city of Cuzco, the often hidden or secret they do in villages
which are surrounding the city of Cuzco.

After that were the ten days Inca Yupanqui Messrs. said that after
those came together with him again, which together had to tell them
the order that they asked ANSI that would make the year and months
and the more parties that they had to have and keep, Inca Yupanqui
told them he had many years he had imagined the months and time of
year, which had found that they were twelve and I did not think saying
a desto twelve months and times thing, but it was good as were going
ANSI and such parties that they had them He was to pose, but because
they had asked, he wanted to ask what (So) and say and declare the
parties and the sacrifices that those months were to ANSI do, they
were attentive and the tomasen firmly in mind, that besides this,
I look forward mesmo I had thought of doing a certain thing he called
Pachaunanchango, which means "knower time "[59] - we can presume Relox
- by which they and their descendants, and they lost track of the
months, you would understand when the time of sowing, labor é, é dressing
their land.

And ANSI, the lords being attentive, Inca Yupanqui said unto them this coming month, in which
have to make the pears, as I have told you, that's where the year begins, we shall call and
has called Pucuy quillaimi [60], which is our December, and January called Coyquis has time,
and one month called Ccollappoccoyquis Hebrero [61] and the March call Pachapoccoyquis [62] and
as of April Ayrihuaquis [63] and the month of May called Aymorayquis Keel [64]. In this month was
ordered é Inca Yupanqui that it should be another party in the sun very solene, in which hiciesen
great sacrifices in order to quel the earth had given them and corn that she had, and that
since then began to fuck their maize, were to begin the party and last until at the end of June,
and that in the month of June, which called Hatun cosqui quillan, than in December last year
were ordered apricots in aquesta party constituted in the month of June, to dress shirts woven
of gold and silver and iridescent feathers, and can not wait posts
patens é their feathers and gold bracelets, saliesen to this feast,
and that at this event should give an end to their fasting and sacrifices,
since they were sorted apricots until there had been, and there began
to rejoice and celebrate another constituted craves to be had by Simentera
sun, to which party ANSI starting from May until late June, as we
have heard, called and appointed Yahuarincha aymoray [65].

Which sent party that was done in the square is the agora do espital in Cuzco, which is at the
outlet of this city, do call Rimacpampa, to which party had Messrs. dresses out of the city of a red
shirt that gave up feet, in which party ordered it hiciesen great sacrifices to idols, do they
burn many cattle slaughtered é é é food clothing, and in such guacas were offered many gold
and silver jewelry.

As of July was called Cahuarquis [66], which ordered that no party will do him no, most of them
said this month they were to irrigate their land, were to begin é plant their corn and potatoes
and quinoa [67] until the month of September came out é, and August Capacsiquis called [68],
and the month of September called Cituaiquis [69]. This month say that it was Inca Yupanqui hiciesen
two parties, one almost wants to look to which we do in San Juan, because they rise at midnight
and washed until rie day, and have some torches lit, and after being washed, these torches danse in
the back, and throw himself say that any ill health and bad they have. É the other party is [T]
he called the Inca Yupanqui Purappucquiu [70], [é] é ansímismo sent the to do this month, which
he commanded that they should do to the water, the hiciesen E ansímismo sacrifices and these sacrifices
commanded that offered a lot of clothes and sheep and coca, and that in any few herbs and plants that
were in the fields, flowers Dellas favorable answer, all of which commanded offered the waters
in this way: them to take plenty of clothes and cast them in that River of Cuzco in the do the two
rivers meet, that many sheep and a favorable answer ansímismo lamb and to offer them water,
and decapitated in that place do the clothes were cast, and then that would make a great fire there
which burnt these sheep and lambs, the ciniza é of those eager burned, cast into the water at
that very site, and then after that, cast into the river and the
flowers have heard: and after this, he cast them into the water that
lot of ground coca é shredded.

And after that was coming down when the sun set [71], in a site, which was sure standing in a part
where it could be good to see, and so they like knew from that site do it stop, the course
would do when the sun was coming down in that right at the top of the hills, make four pyramids
made of stone or marble, amid the two smaller than the other two sides, and two states altor
each pictures, and section one another a fathom, except that the two small middle became more
together, one to the other half will breaststroke. And when the sun came out, still do a job
Inca Yupanqui stopped to watch and gauge this right, gets out and is on the right and middle
desto two pillars, and when it sets, the same thing, do the turns, through which the common
people I was understanding that it was time, I look forward to planting, as to catch, because
the clocks were four to do the sun came out, and four to do was setting the course do not differ
and movements so the sun does in the year. Erros the Inca Yupanqui in the month to take to come
to one and to our mind the months of the year that craves said, because he took December January
having to make, but at last he learned to understand and give orders to his republic.

After they had done é Inca Yupanqui given orders in the year and months and festivals that he
were to hold, and made clocks, recreating and having loose on the things that you have heard time
and space of two years, which the Lord spent time to stand on its people, because natural and chiefs
who were subject to him they had space and time to idle work on their land that had been in
the repair craves had done in streams the city of Cuzco, they had space because they desired
é é é take time to plant large fields, with which they repaired all meals and provision, with
which they had é to serve and contribute to the city of Cuzco and to the deposits in it were,
it seems rescibia already his services, and any other penalty for both ANSI had idleness he and
others ajuntóse a day with the main city of Cuzco and said unto them already had idleness that
seemed that it was time for the caciques and gentlemen at subjectively should come with their
meals and supplies to the city of Cuzco and bring him all the more people could be, because
he had agreed to make themselves rebuild the city of Cuzco in such a way that was perpetually made
and manufactured in certain buildings he yes I had thought, and that after they were made,
they would see, for which it was necessary lot of very large numbers of people, and that this
was necessary to depart from the city certain gentlemen of the people there on that board with him
were: and then they saw that there wanted to go, because, with those remaining, he had need,
while those who had to go were, of what we do and provide for such a building necessary. É then there
were appointed ten lords, twenty apricots, which departed from there
and were then to the towns and provinces and provide them to bring
what we have heard.

Inca Yupanqui and the other gentlemen who were there and were coming out of your visit, were
all over the city about five miles, and [instead] it seemed, sought looked é é do site do hobiesen
saws could be out stone quarrying, clay é, é land for mixtures of these buildings had to wear;
where they found that the site of Saluoma [72] had a lot of very large number of very large
stone and quarries. É seen the Inca and other men who already had there gear and raised and
a lot of very large numbers quarry, and returned to the city, where they gave orders, after arrivals
were, in ANSI so had to bring that carry the stone é, for which they were sent made many very
large amount of thick ropes, ropes of niervos é é sheep leather.

[I] ANSI this was done, the city drew Inca Yupanqui and did make clay figures While the thought
anxiously as the make and build: and then questo was made, arrived at that apricot seasoning
é é time those gentlemen who had gone to make food and bring proveimiento é many people to make
such buildings, as history has told you: and as has looked forward, the chiefs saluted the Inca
in the way that you already digimos, and the Inca intranasal received with love, with which
it seemed that they would rather loose-fitting five day, so was made. At the end of which, Paresce
the Inca would be well to order they will begin to perform, the manufacture of the city, feeling
that such people and craves yet come to rest had the time it enough, and he let the chiefs
everyone gather together his people in a certain campaign and the verifications flat and each
for himself, because I wanted to deliver to all the work that ANSI
had to do, and that the order dalles It had to have.

And being ANSI time of such people, divided his work between such caciques, who sent some rough
hauling rocks for the foundation, and to others that a favorable answer mud which they liked, it
was good and sticky with mud and stone which sent crude to the foundations of these buildings, taking
them out of foundation, which was the foundation and seat from which bumped them with water, to
which he bade them were built of rough stone é sticky mud, so that if water entered through
them, was not a party to undo é eat this mud, because, as I said, at most the seat of the city
were swamps é springs, all of which were taken from springs ordered distributed é so that at
the houses of this city were made for their pipes and sources for proveimiento service and della.

And
likewise to others and would open commanded them to put the foundations
of such houses and buildings of the city, and ordered that would cause
to other stone for building which was to build after these foundations
were ANSI high weight and be who were to be: and to other sent to
adobe clay and sticky earth, in which bricks are cast forth too much
straw, the straw which is after the manner of esparto d'Spain, which
was mixed earth and straw so, that such bricks were well made and
thick, through which bricks are had to build from the work of stone
up until such buildings and houses altor were on and be who had to
carry.

Others ordered a favorable answer, and carry plenty of Alder [73] long and right, giving the
largor and had as have. And likewise ordered that by the time they were made and high buildings
and positions proportion and might have had that for [that] the mixture had to wear ANSI in the
splendor of houses, eager for inside and outside, pegase and does not crack, ordered that a favorable
answer for that time too much about cacti they called Aguacolla quizca [74], with the juice
of which such walls were anointed: and to be the mixture é mixed well mixed with plenty of wool,
was placed in such walls on wetting already have heard of these cacti and that in such a mixture,
if they wanted wool throw, cast them straw, the qual was very much ground, and so he be given such
luster to the walls and buildings.

All this that you have heard being provided, all these things and each, rose those chiefs and
then put through the work of such buildings and ordnance proveimientos so I was sent that to
him this was necessary, and then ordered to go aside Inca Yupanqui all of the city of Cuzco in their
homes, and bring forth out of everything within them had, é pueblezuelos would switch to those
that were there together: and as this was ANSI fact, ordered of such houses were demolished by land.
Where, as this was made plain é é clean [75] he himself by his hands together with the other
lords of the city, by bringing a string, them [76] pointed out and measured with such a string
of solar houses that anxiously é had to do, é Dellas foundations and buildings, all of which
pointed ANSI open ground, and being the supplies needed for such work [brought, involved?],
began to make and build della your city and houses, buildings and houses which were made to
walk in the works and buildings Dell will continue, while the work
lasted fifty thousand Indians é tardóse since Inca Yupanqui commanded
begin to repair the land and rivers of the city and the such do and
build, until all of which was that you have heard and done, twenty
years.

É as the city was made perfects é start, Inca Yupanqui ordered that all major of Cuzco and the
other neighbors and residents of him, were together in some open field: and being ANSI time,
he ordered there the trace of the city and had sent paint to ANSI of clay, and tiniéndolas
before him, gave é é distributed solar houses already built and made as you have heard, to
the lords of Cuzco and to the other neighbors and inhabitants of all apricots which were descendants
of his lineage and the other lords that even he had happened since the beginning of Manco
Capac, villages and sending them to people in this way: The three gentlemen settled their friends
from the House of the Sun down, towards the junta of the two rivers, houses in that space between
the two rivers that were made, and from Casas del Sol down, which sent that site was called Hurin
Cuzco, which says "the low Cuzco, "and the top ends of the point of this, ordered the appointment
Pumap suck that says "lion's tail," in which populated place these three gentlemen, they and those
of his lineage, of them and each for himself began é decindieron the three lineages of Hurin
Cuzco, which is called Vica Quirao lords, and the other Mayta Apu and other Quilliscachi Urco Guaranga
[77]. É de las Casas del Sol up, all that took the two streams up the hill do agora is the strength,
God and handed over to Messrs. relatives propincos é descendants of his own lineage straight
línia sons of lords and ladies from his own debt and lineage, for
the three lords of the Houses of the Sun sent down to people, according
to already have heard, were the bastard children of gentlemen, although
they were of his lineage, which had strange women there in their nation
and of low degree, to which children ANSI incurred, Cconcha Guaccha
call them, which means "come from poor people and low generation;"
and those such, although the Inca children are called ANSI, é are
not taken or complied none dest, ANSI men and women, the other lords,
but by a orejon of others common.

Because they will know that the Inca who craves is Lord, a woman principal: this [no] debt has to be
poor, and this such a woman must be the principal and debt, sister or cousin hers, to which
they call women Pihuihuarmi [78] and by another name Mamanguarmi, and people common, as such
principal wife of the Lord, call when craves to come say hello, Pocaxa (?) Intichuri capac coya
guacchacuyac [79], which says "Child of the Sun and one queen friendly to the poor, "and this lady
that had to be father and mother Mr. é straight debt Inca without which she would race or Concha
Guaccha board, which is what we have heard. And this this woman received the Inca by his principal
wife the day he took the fringe of the state and insinia real, and anxiety in children who had this
lady that was appointed Pihuichuri, which says as it were legitimate children, and more desto was
lord of the state and legitimate heir; and that if the case was that the Inca died leaving that
such a child who could not govern, they did so [80] Lord, and brought them the tassel on his
head, but this just was nursing, called him to é such child Huayna
Capac, who says "boy king," although they build the name, not understanding
which means, [they say] that rich young man says, because they will
know, that layer being season, says rich and Guaina boy says: and
if I said this name Guaina layer, say lad rich, but says Guaina Capac,
with c-season, says boy king.

And so he built another name mesmo who do not understand, he says youth [81] Viracocha it means
and we have said God, because this name appointing them to say é must was the Maker: and as the
Spanish might come to this land and they would see people very foreign to his being, as the
story below you will, call her to all and to each itself, Viracocha, and wanting to build
this name seemed that they were understanding speaking, to think and imagine parábanse veering
in that language means "shortening," and car says "sea," all of which declared and said he
wanted to say "butter of the sea," and "Sea foam," which is not to say it, but God himself.
And so when the Spanish came to this land, they called this name é had to be gods.

É back to our history, such a child to this señalábanle their tutors and governors, which govern
the whole time they saw was not of age to rule, and that if the Inca, after have received to
this female, or before this one, fifty women had other sisters and unpaid debts, because they
desired was his custom to have all her sisters by women, those children that these had not
been inherited by this her any, if not the son of the so Pihui, legitimate wife, they say.
And if this case was that the Inca did not hobiese in her children, or the so pariese daughters,
in this case the state was finally the day Inca, the eldest son who craves hobiese been in any
of the other women her sisters or debts, as they saw that this showed itself to be and law enforcement
officials will and capacity to govern his kingdom é republic: and if it was exactly as it
should, chose from among their brothers who they thought best that could govern, é é to this
that this that gave the so-é married his sister, the way you have heard, for so his father
had been in such Pihuihuarmi or woman main to which they were respected é, craves the Lords
of the city of Cuzco as other lords of the earth, as his leading
lady that é queen of them all.

É back to the purpose of sharing the city and houses of it, the distributed Inca Yupanqui in
the way we have heard, taking it to other houses and it craves saw that solar enough for him.
