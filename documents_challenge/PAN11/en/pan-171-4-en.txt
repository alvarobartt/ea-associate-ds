 I was going to sunrise. In the red furrows larks flew with the joy of
living another day, and the naughty sparrows perched on the windows yet closed, pecking wood,
telling the inside with its cry of drifters used to cadge 'Up, lazy! To work the land, to eat us !...»

In
Toni's shack, known all around for Pimento, had just entered his
wife Pepeta, an animated creature, whitish and flabby flesh in his
youth, undermined by anemia, which was nevertheless the hardest working
female entire garden.

At dawn he was back in the market.

Got up at three, loaded with baskets Toni picked vegetables to close the night before between
oaths and vows against a naughty life in which both have to work, and to grope for the path,
guided in Dark as the good child of the garden, going to Valencia, while her husband, that
good boy who cost so dear, still snoring in the hot students, well wrapped in Carrion rugs marriage.

Those
who bought vegetables in bulk to resell it to this young woman knew before dawn and was in the
market of Valencia, sitting in their baskets, shivering under the
thin and threadbare shawl.

I looked with envy, not realized, those who could drink a cup of coffee to combat the cool morning.
And with the patience of a beast submissive waiting to give him money for vegetables that had
been set in their complex calculations, to keep Toni and bring the house forward.

After the sale ran back toward his cabin, hoping to save as soon as one hour way.

Came back in office to develop a second industry: after vegetables milk. And pulling the halter
of a cow blonde, who had hit the tail as loving Satellite a playful
calf, returned to the city with his wand under his arm and tin as
to serve customers.

La Roche, and dubbed the cow for his blond hair, bellowed sweet, shuddering under a burlap trappings,
hurt by the cool of the morning, turning his eyes wet towards the
hut, he stayed behind with his stable black, relaxed, in which straw
smelly thought with pleasure of the dream unfulfilled.

Pepeta the herding with his staff. It was getting late, and they would complain about the customers.
And the cow and the calf trotted through downtown Alboraya Road,
deep, muddy, deeply furrowed lanes.

On the slopes side, one arm in the basket and the other swinging,
spent endless cigar beads and spinners of silk, all the virginity
of the garden, going to work in factories, leaving with the flutter
of her skirts a trail of chastity rude and rough.

Fields scattered by the blessing of God.

After the trees and houses that blocked the horizon as the sun peeped huge red wafer, horizontal
casting golden needles forced to cover their eyes. The mountains in the background and towers
of the city were taking a rosy tint, the puffs that rowed by coloreábanse sky as skeins of silk
crimson ditches and puddles in the road seemed fishiest fire. It sounded inside the barracks dragging
the broom the clash of crockery, all the noises of the morning cleaning. Agachábanse women
in slopes, taking the basket next to the laundry. Jumped on the brown paths rabbits, with his
devious smile, teaching, to flee, heading for the pink buttocks the button-shaped tail, and
on piles of manure blonde, cock, surrounded by his cloqueantes odalisques, uttered a cry of
jealous sultan, with the ardent pupil chins red with anger.

Pepeta, insensible to this awakening he witnessed daily, continued
their march, more more quickly, on an empty stomach, aching legs and
undergarments impregnated a sweat of his own weakness and poor white
blood, that perhaps escaped during for weeks, contravening the rules
of nature.

The avalanche of hard working people that was heading to Valencia filled bridges. Pepeta passed
among workers in the suburbs who came to the lunch bag neck slope,
stopped at the octroi of Consumption to take his ticket - a few coins
that all ached on the soul - and went through the deserted streets,
cheering the cowbell de la Rocha with badajeo pastoral melody, sounding
to the sleepy bourgeois with green meadows and idyllic pastoral scenes.

He

had the poor woman parishioners scattered throughout the city. His departure was a convoluted
journey through the streets, stopping before the gates closed, a knock here, three and ringing away,
and always, then the shrill, sharp cry, which seemed impossible could arise from its poor and
satin chest: "The lleeet!" Jug in hand down the maid disheveled in sandals, with swollen eyes,
to receive the milk, or the old caretaker, still with blanket that had to go to the Mass of
the morning.

At eight o'clock, after serving all customers, Pepeta was seen near the neighborhood of Fishermen.

As
also found in the office, poor orchard went bravely into the dirty alleys, which seemed dead at that
hour. Always, on entering, felt a certain uneasiness, instinctive repugnance weak stomach. But its
spirit of honest and sick woman known to overcome this impression, and continued on with some
pride vanity, a pride of female caste, comforting to see that she,
weak and overwhelmed by poverty, was still superior to others.

In the closed and silent houses came the breath of cheap debauchery, loud and undisguised: the smell
of spicy meat and rotten, wine and sweat. Through the cracks of doors seemed to escape the brutal
breath and sleep after a night landslide caresses of fierce and drunken amorous whims.

Pepeta heard his name called.

At the door of a ladder beckoning a good girl, bare-chested, ugly, no other charm than a youth about
to disappear, the eyes wet, the twisted ribbon, and cheeks blush stains from the night before:
a cartoon, a clown for vice.

The styling, pressing his lips with a gesture of pride and disdain for the distances it was
quite clear, he began to milk the udder de la Rocha inside the jug out to him the girl. It
did not take his view of the peasant.

- Pepeta! - His voice wavering, as if it were not certain that was herself.

Pepeta raised his head, fixed his eyes for the first time in the slut,
and seemed to hesitate.

- Rosario!

... Is that you?

Yes, she was, I said with sad nods.

And Pepeta immediately expressed amazement. She there! ... The daughter of parents so honored! Shame
on you, Lord ...

The harlot, by custom of the trade, tried to accommodate with cynical smile, the gesture skeptical
who knows the secret of life and believes in nothing, the exclamations of shocked styling.
But the gaze of the eyes eventually clear Pepeta embarrassing, and
lowered head as if to mourn.

No, it was not bad. He had worked in factories, had served as home to a family, but finally
gave her sisters example, tired of being hungry, and there he was, receiving sometimes affection
and other blows, until they burst forever. It was natural: where no father and mother, the
family ends well.

Of all his fault the master of the earth, it Don Salvador, sure to burn in hell. Ah, you thief!
... And how he had lost whole family!

Forgot Pepeta cold and reserved attitude to join the outrage of the girl. Truth all true, this
guy was to blame greedy. I knew the whole orchard. Good God, and how you lose a house! So good
that Barret was the poor guy! If you raise his head and saw their daughters! ... They knew
in the garden that the poor father had died in prison in Ceuta For two years, and as to the
mother, the old wretch had just suffer in a bed Hospital.

The twists and turns the world in ten years! Who had told them to her and to her sisters, used
to live at home and queens who end up that way? Lord! Lord! Libradnos a bad person! ...

Rosario was encouraged with the conversation seemed to rejuvenate with this childhood friend.
His eyes, before dying, sparked by remembering the past. And your booth? What land? Remained
abandoned, right? ... This liked: busting, which is the Holy hiciesen the sons of Don Salvador
rascal! ... It was all I could comfort her.

I was very grateful Pimento and to all the folks they had prevented other work that you enter of
right belonged to his family. And if someone wanted to grab something, well known was the remedy
.... Pum! A shotgun that break the head.

The girl was whipped up, shining in his eyes sparks of ferocity. Revived in the harlot passive
beast accustomed to the beatings, the daughter of the garden, which is born from the shotgun
hanging behind the door and holidays and aims to delight the smoke of gunpowder.

After speaking of the sad past, awakens curiosity was wondering Rosario all there, and ended
in Pepeta. Poor thing! Everyone could see she was not happy. Still young, age revealed only clear
those big eyes virgin, dupes and timid. The body, a mere skeleton, and blonde hair, color of sweet
corn, and appeared gray to handfuls before thirty years. What life gave Pimento? Ever so drunk
and fleeing work? She had sought, by marrying against the advice
of everyone.

Good boy, yes, he shook everyone in the tavern Cup on Sunday afternoon,
when he played the trick with the most handsome in the garden, but
at home should be an insufferable husband .... Although In truth,
all men were equal.

If you know it! Dogs that were not worth is worth looking at them.

Daughter! And what was the poor deteriorated Pepeta! ...

A booming voice came down like thunder tomboy through the gap in the
ladder.

- Elisa!

... Upload milk soon. The Lord is waiting.

Rosario began to laugh herself. Now called Elisa: Do not you know? Age requirement rename office
and speak with an Andalusian accent.

And mimicked with rustic grace the voice of the invisible tomboy.

But in spite of his joy, was quick to withdraw. He feared the above.

The booming voice or The Lord of the milk could give something bad for his delay. He climbed the
ladder faster, After much to recommend Pepeta that ever pass through there, to remember together
the things from the garden.

The weary bell rang de la Rocha over an hour through the streets of Valencia. Released the withered
teats to milk the last drop of tasteless product of a poor grass
leaves cabbage and waste, and finally undertook Pepeta back to his
hut.

The poor peasant walking sad and pensive under the impression that meeting. Remembered like it was
the day before the terrible tragedy that engulfed the Barret with whole family.

Since then, the fields over a hundred years ago the ancestors of the
poor working labrador had been left by the wayside.

His cabin, deserted, without a hand merciful to cast a patch to the roof and a handful of mud
cracks walls, was sinking slowly.

Ten years of continuous flow together had managed to ruin that people do not take notice already
on it. Pepeta it had long had not stopped his attention to the old shack. This interest only
to the boys, who, inheriting the hatred of his parents, he plunged into between the nettles
of the barren fields to mow the abandoned house with stones, breaking the timbers of its closed door,
or blind with dirt and stones that opened well under a very old vines.

But this morning, Pepeta, influenced by his recent encounter, he noticed debris and to stopped
on the way for a better view.

The Barret fields, or rather for her, "the Jew and his unholy Don Salvador heirs "were a blur
of misery amid the fertile garden, worked and smiling. Ten years of neglect had hardened the
ground, drawing from its neglected innards all parasitic plants, all the thorns which God has created
for the punishment of the farmer. A dwarf jungle, tangled and misshapen spread over those fields,
with a wave of foreign shades of green, tinged here and there by
mysterious and rare flowers, the kind that only arise in the ruins
and cemeteries.

Under the foliage of the jungle tiny and encouraged by the safety of his lair, grew and multiplied
all sorts of nasty, spilling into neighboring fields: Rough-backed green lizards, giant beetles
with metallic shimmer shell, spiders short-legged and hairy, even snakes that glide immediate
ditches. There living in the heart of the beautiful and neat plain, forming separate world, devouring
one to others, and even cause harm to the neighbors, they were respected with a certain reverence,
for the seven plagues of Egypt seemed little to those of the garden to throw on those lands are
cursed.

As Barret lands would never be for men, were nesting in them bicharraco
disgusting, and the more the merrier.

In the middle of these desolate fields, which stood out on the beautiful
plain as a stain of dirt in a regal cloak of green velvet, rose the
cabin, or rather this, falling, with straw cap of gutted, teaching
through the openings pierced the wind rain and its rotten wooden ribbing.

The walls, scratched by water, showed their raw clay bricks, no more than a very slight white
spots that exposed the former whitewashed. The door was broken underneath, gnawed by rats, with
cracks that cut from one extreme to another. Two or three windows, completely open and martyred by gales,
hung from one hinge, and were to fall at any moment, just blow a rude gust of wind.

Sorry to ruin that mood, squeezing the heart. It seemed that the left were CASUCO to shut out
ghosts in the night, who were inside screaming to people from murdered, that the whole bush was
hiding under a shroud of it hundreds of corpses.

Horrific images was what inspired the contemplation of these abandoned fields, and highlighted
even more dismal misery when contrasted with the lands near, red, well maintained, correct full
of rows of vegetables and seedlings, to which was the autumn leaves
transparency caramel.

Even the birds fled from the fields of death, perhaps for fear of
the animaluchos that rebullían under brush or by sniffing the breath
of misfortune.

On the broken thatch, if anything could see was the fluttering of
black wings and treacherous funeral feathers of crows and kites, which
were shaken mute the laden trees of joyful and playful fluttering
PIID, remaining silent the garden, as if there were sparrows half-mile
radius.

Pepeta going to move forward, toward his white farmhouse, which peeked through the trees some fields
beyond, but had to lie still on the high side of the road, that he
should a cart loaded advancing stumbling and seemed to come from the
city.

Her feminine curiosity was excited to notice him.

He was a poor farm cart drawn by a bony old nag, which helped in hard bumps a tall man who was
walking next to him encouraging him with shouts and pops whiplash.

Labrador dressed, but how to wear the scarf round his head, his pants corduroy and other details
of his suit, which was not betrayed in the garden, where personal adornment has gradually been
contaminated by the taste of the city. Was a farmer in some remote village: kidney may come
from the province.

On the car amontonábanse, forming pyramid to higher than the poles, all kinds domestic objects.
Was the emigration of an entire family.

Consumptive mattresses, straw mattresses scandalous stuffed corn husk, esparto chairs, pans,
kettles, plates, baskets, bed green benches, all piled on the car, dirty, worn out, miserable,
smelling famine, to escape desperate, as if the march unfortunately
after nipping family heels.

At the top of this mess three children could be seen hugging, which provided the fields with
wide eyes, as explorers visiting a country for the first time.

On foot and behind the cart as watching for anything out of it fell, a woman and a marching girl,
tall, slim, slim, it seemed daughter. On the other side of the horse, helping when the vehicle
is stopped in a bad way, was a boy of eleven years.

Its exterior betrayed serious child, accustomed to struggle with poverty, is a man at the age others
play. A dirty little dog panting up the rear.

Pepeta, supported on the back of his cow, they looked forward, ever possessed the most curiosity.
"Where would these poor people?

The way that, tributary to Alboraya not going anywhere. Extinguished in the distance, and exhausted
by the myriad branching paths and trails that gave entrance to the barracks.

But his curiosity had an unexpected ending. Jesus!

The car left the road, crossing the dilapidated bridge of logs and earth which gave access to
the cursed land, and is got by Barret fields, flattening their tires
brush respected.

The family remained behind, saying with gestures and words confusing
the impression that caused him misery, but straight at the wrecked
cabin, and who takes possession of what is yours.

Pepeta not want to see more. Now I really ran to his hut. Anxious to arrive before left to the
cow and calf, and the two beasts continued their march calmly, as who does not care about things
outside the barn and has insurance.
Pimento was lying on one side of his hut, smoking lazily, staring
at three sticks smeared with lime, put in the sun, around which fluttered
some birds. Occupation was a master.

Upon seeing his wife come to
the astonished eyes and poor chest heaving, Pimento changed positions
to hear better, recommending that does not approach the wands.

Let's
see, what was that? Have you had stolen the cow? ...

Pepeta, with
emotion and fatigue, could barely say two words together.

"The land
of Barret .... An entire family .... Iban to work, to live in the
barracks. She I had seen. " 

Pimento, bird hunter with league foe
of labor and terror of the contoured, could not impassive gravity
retain great man at such unexpected news.

- Recontracordóns! ...

Got
a jump straight weighed and human muscles, and began to run without
waiting for further explanation.

His wife saw how he ran cross country
to a bluff to the lands immediately cursed. There he knelt, lay on
his stomach to peer through the reeds like a Bedouin lurking, and
after a few minutes he returned to run, lost in this labyrinth of
paths, each of which led to a hut, to a field where men hunched by
shone his hoe like a flash of steel
