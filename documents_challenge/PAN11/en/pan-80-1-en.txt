 Quickly
he took the letter in his hands at which he soon recognized Melissa's handwriting. It seemed written
on a leaf that had been torn from an old notebook with the effect of preventing any sacrilegious indiscretion,
it was closed with six wafers.

Opening it almost tenderly, the teacher read the following: "Honoroable Sir: As you read this,
I will have fled, never to return. Never, never, never! Can you give my beads to Mary Jane and my
Pride of America (a chrome defaced snuff box) to Florinda Flanders? Alhough, I do not have anything
to give to Sophia Morpheus. You know I do it for what I love most. Do you know what sovereign
means in my opinion: Well, this: That it is detestable.

That is all, and nothing more freom your respectful servant today - Melissa Smith." Having read this
strange letter, the teacher was thoughtful. He waited until the moon raised his bright face above the
mountains and lit the path that led to the home school, hard bent
with the comings and goings of small feet of the learners and then
he was more satisfied as he tore the letter into small pieces and
scattered it on the ground.

The next day, at dawn, he rose quickly, the road opening through
ferns that seemed like palms, while through the dense thicket of pine
forest, his approach scared the rabbit into its burrow and aroused
the protest of some grumpy crows, who had been up all night.

He then reached the summit where the jungle once found Melissa. There he found downed pine branches
but an empty throne. He approached the area again, looking something like a frightened animal amid the
crisp pines. He hastened away from the tree branches and looked up into the extended arms of
the fallen monarchy but now with his reliance placed on any of the foliage there as if it were a friend.
As he, the teacher, climbed to the old nest, it was still warm, and as he looked upward with his darkened
eyes to the linked branches, that seemed to be on hold, he beheld Melissa.
