  keep their hats all spectators There standing in the parterre and
  is on the right and left between the wall and chairs, custom did
  not seem extremely polite.
  

  There are many good cars Milan public, regular hotels reading rooms,
  theaters, tours, good cafes and beautiful women.
  

  The Austrians, of whom speak little, because I extol the just
  remember, patrolling day and night on the town, ring their swords

  In Milan, were addressed to me at the poetic and heroic unfortunate
  Venice. I left Milan to Treviglio iron line, an hour way: there
  I took a bus that took me three hours to Cucallo, and thence
  to Venice railway, using nine hours.

  
  
  The stations of the railway lines that start in Milan, are poor
  and poorly made: to go up to the coaches needed show your passport
on the road calling ten or twelve times within the same cars as far
along.

  
  
  Around Milan are admirable: I have seen three different lines,
  and all over the countryside flaunts fresh, and enriched with
  a profuse vegetation. From Milan to Treviglio not found any
  people of importance: Cucallo at Venice, are the cities
  of Brescia, Verona, Vicenza and Padua, all except the last, to the
left going to Venice from Milan.

  
  
  The first is found Brescia, a city of forty thousand inhabitants,
  situated at the foot and on a mountain: I saw one of step, has
  very nice appearance, and many elegant towers. Between Brescia
  and Verona, we present the very pretty Lake Garda thirty miles
  of extension, the largest in Italy, from through which steam is excellent
trip to Trento, Tyrol and several other points
