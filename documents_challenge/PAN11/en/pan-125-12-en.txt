 

And back to history, says one of the three quel, we have said called Ayar Cachi was so brave and
had such great power, with the sling removed, or throwing throwing punches rocks, cutting down
the hills, and sometimes pulling up, they put the stones near clouds, which, for the other
two brothers were seen, weighed them, thinking his disgrace was not even in those things, and
so passionate with envy, sweet begged him with soft words, but rather full of deceit, to re-enter the
mouth of a cave where they had their treasures, to bring a cup of gold that they had forgotten,
and to beg the sun, his father, give them chance that they might lord prosperous land. Ayar Cachi,
believing that there was caution in what his brothers told him cheerfully was to do what he had
said, and there was well finished entering the cave, when Two other charges on him so many stones,
which apparently was no more, which last, say them very true that the earth shook in such a way
that sank many hills falling on the valleys [22].

So far have the apricots on the origin of the Incas, because as they
were of such great presumption and made so high, they wanted it to
be understood to have this pass remanecido and be children of the
sun, where after, when they praised the Indians with great renown,
called them Wide hatun apu, intipchuri!, which means in our language
to say: Oh very much Lord, son of the sun!

And I for me I have to believe this is due questo pretend, shall, that as in Hatuncollao Zapana
rose, and elsewhere other captains did the same thing brave, quest remanecieron Incas, some three
brothers had to be brave and courageous and who hobiese great thoughts, some people WITH THESE
natural regions, or come on the other side of the mountains of the Andes, which, finding gear,
and conquer would gain the mastery they had, and yet this could be what is told Ayar Cachi and
the other being charming, it would cause by the Devil to do what they did. In short, we can not draw
from her questo otherwise.

Well after Ayar Cachi was inside the cave, the other two brothers agreed with some people that
they had arrived, to make another population, which they named Tampu Quiru, which in our language
will mean teeth or palace chamber, and so, you understand orchestras populations were not large
or more than some small forces.

And in that instead were some days when they had heavy and have thrown himself to his brother
Ayar Cachi, which call themselves Huanacaure another name.

Continuing the relationship that I took in Cuzco, apricots say that after having Quiru Tampu
settled in the two Incas, passing many days without it, neglected and more see Ayar Cachi, saw
him coming through the air with large feathered wings painted, and
they very fear that his visit caused them, wanted to flee, the more
he quickly took away that fear, saying: "Be not afraid nor acongojeis,
I did not come but it begins to be called the Empire of the Incas,
so let, let the population that you have done, and go below to that
you see a valley, where they later found Cuzco, approaches what has
to be worth; porquestos are suburbs and of little importance, and
that is the big city, where sumptuous temple must be built and be
so served, honest and popular, quel sol [23] is the most praised,
and because I always I have to pray to God for you, and be party to
briefly attain to great lordship quest on a hill near here I'll stay
the way and manner you see me, and always will be for you and for
your descendants hallowed and adored, and heis Guanacaure call, and
payment of the good works that you have received me, I pray to God
I always adore and it make me altars where sacrifices are made, and
you doing this, you shall be in the war helped me, and the signal
that from now on you have to be estimated, honest and feared, will
horadaros ears the way that now you will see me.

"And then this This, say they found him with ears [24] of gold, which was round as a moans.

The
brothers were terrified of what Vian, were as silent, not talking, and finally, after the
agitation, said they were happy to do what he commanded, and then haste is went to the hill
called the Guanacaure, which from that time until now had as sacred; and on top of the Volvo to
see Ayar Cachi - that who the culprit must be some devil if this is something they have in
truth and God permitting, under false pretenses WITH THESE them to understand their desire, want
you to worship and to sacrifice, most attempts Quél Quesada, - and I turned to speak, saying, was proper
bolrra them to take the crown of the empire or the who were to be sovereign masters, and who knew
how in such an act be done for armed young men to be gentlemen and be held by nobles. They answered
that the brothers and had first said that all his orders would be fulfilled, and obidient signal,
together hands and heads bowed, I made the mocha, or reverence, to best understand; and apricots
because they claim that here was taking the bolrra and being armed Gentlemen, pornélo here,
and will serve to avoid the need to turn in forward to repeat, and puédese have the tasty and
very true story, because in Cuzco Manco Inca made the supreme bolrra or crown, and there live
many Spanish who were present to this cirimonia, é I've heard to many of them. It is true that the
Indians also say quen time of the last kings was done with more solemnity and meetings with
people prepared and wealth so great that can not be innumerable.

Apparently, these guys ordered this order to be bolrra or take the crown, and say Ayar Cachi
in the same hill Guanacaure dressed out of this sort: that was to Inca be dressed in a black camisole
day, no necklace, a colorful paintings, and in the head with a tawny braid be given some laps,
and covered with a blanket tawny long been out of his room and to go to the camp to catch a straw
makes, and must take to bring it all day without eating or drinking, because it's fast, and that
mother and sisters Inca whatever, must be spinning at such a rate, which at the day itself were
spinning and knit four dresses for business he himself, and have to fast without food or water
which in this work we were. One must be dressed desto T fawn and white blanket, and the other
must be the blanket and all white shirt and the other has to be blue and flocaduras cords.
These dresses have to put whatever the Inca, and fast the time has established which is a month, and
to call this fast zaziy [25], which is done in a room in the palace real fire without seeing
or have intercourse with woman, and these days of fasting Ladies their seed must be very great
care to do with their own hands too much of their chicha, wine tanks made from corn, and have
to wear clothes richly. After spending time of fasting, which comes out to be master, carrying in
his hands a silver halberd and gold, and goes to the house of an elderly relative to where you
have to be shorn hair; and wearing one of those clothes out of Cuzco, where he makes this
event, and go to the hill of Guanacaure where we say Quest's brothers,
and made some cirimonias and sacrifices become where it is prepared
to wine, where they drink, and then leaves the Inca to a hill ANAGUA
appointed, and since the beginning of runs away, because they see
how light will brave in war, and then bringing down from some wool
attached to a halberd, a sign that when you walk in fighting with
their enemies, must try to bring the hair and heads of reach.

Fact they were going to mesmo Guanacaure hill to fuck up straight straw, and he had to be king,
had a big bunch of it, of gold, very thin, even, and it was another to hill called Yahuira
[26], where he wore another of the clothes and such, and head was coming down or llautu braids
called Pillaca, cheese as a crown, below which hung ears [27] of gold, and on top put on a bonnet
and headband feathers sewn, they Puruchuco call [28], and the halberd tied a long golden ribbon
that reached the ground, and breasts wearing a golden moon, and in this way, in the presence
of all those who there were, killed a sheep, whose blood and flesh divided among the more major
for the eat raw, in which meant that if they were not brave, that his enemies eat their meat
from the fate that they had eaten the sheep that was killed. And there they made a solemn oath,
to his custom, by the sun, to sustain the order of chivalry and the defense of Cuzco die, if
need be, and then opened the ears, making them so great that has a Dell moans each round, and done
this a heads ponens fierce lion, and return with a roar at the plaza of Cuzco, where he was
a great chain of gold, which encircled the whole, being supported by posts of silver and gold
in the comedy Desta square dancing and they made very great parties in his own way, walking
those who were to be men covered with the heads of lions, I have said, for that would imply
brave and fierce as are those animals. Putting an end to these dances, they are armed gentlemen,
and are called dried apricots, and have their privileges, and enjoy great freedom, and are worthy,
if elected, to take the crown, the fringe forests, which when given to Mr it must be the rule,
are major holidays, and joins a large number of people, and which is to be emperor has first to
take his own sister to wife, state Becausethe lineage does not happen in real low, and makes
the zaziy large tanks fast. And in the interest of these things happen, because the Lord being
held in the sacrifices and fasting does not come to understand in private business and governance,
was law among the Incas, that when any fallescia, or was given to another crown or tassel, which
could indicate one of the leading men of people and had mature advice and great authority to rule
the entire empire the Incas, as the Lord Himself during those days, and to this that he was
permitted to have hablalle guard and reverence. And this is done, and received the blessings
in the temple Curicancha receives the tassel, which was great and came out of llautu he had in
his head covering his to fall over his eyes, and this was played and revered sovereign. And
at the holidays were the main men who had more than five leagues sent Quellos and parescia Cuzco
very great wealth in gold and silver, and precious stones and feathers, encompassed the entire
large chain of gold, and the admirable figure of the sun, which was all of such greatness, weighing,
to certainly what the Indians say, more than four million pounds of gold, and if she did not tassel
in Cuzco, had the Inca named a joke, without your lordship indeed [29] and thus is not counted
Atahuallpa king, but as it was so valuable and killed so many people, was obeyed for fear of
many nations.

Returning to the Quest in Guanacaure Hill after he said Ayar Cachi hobo them the way they were
to have to be knighted, The Indians, who, looking against his brother Ayar Manco, told him to
go with the two women of the valley that you There was, where he later founded the Cuzco, not
forgetting to come to make sacrifices that place as he had first prayed, and as this hobiese said,
so he and the other brother became two stone figures, which showed men have sizes, which have
seen by Ayar Manco, taking their wives, came to where now is the Cuzco, he found the city, naming
and calling out Manco Capac dende, which means king and lord rich.

I Reídome what I have eScript these Indians, I tell my what they escriptura told to me by him,
and before that nests remove a lot less alone. Then as Manco Capac hobiese seen what had happened
to his brothers, and came to the valley where now is Cuzco, looking up to heaven, that pedia
apricots say with great humility the sun that will encourage and help in the new population wanted
to do, and that turned eyes towards the hill of Guanacaure, pedia do the same to his brother,
who already had and revered by God, and looking at the flight of birds and the signs of stars
and other wonders full of confidence, holding it for certain that the new settlement was to
flourish, and he be della taken by founder and father of the Incas that she had to reign. And
so, in name of your Ticiviracocha and sun and other gods, made the foundation of the new city, the
original and the beginning of which was a small stone house thatched Manco Capac with their wives
did, which they named Curicancha, who wants fencing gold say, where was that after so famous and
so rich temple sun, and that now is convent of friars of the Order of St. Dominic, and tiénese
certainly in questo time by Manco Capac Inca to, had in the region of Cuzco Indians in quantity,
but as he did not bother me a bad or no, did not prevent the stay on their land, formerly
rejoiced with him, and so, Manco Capac understood to make the house and said, and was given
to their religion and worship of their gods, and was of great presumption and who represented
great authority.

One of his wives was barren, never undertaken, in the other [30] three sons hobo and a daughter,
was named the greatest Inca Roca Inca, and daughter Ocllo, and the names of the other two more
have neither say that the eldest son married his sister, to whom was it they had to do to
be loved and not hated the natives, and other big things. At this time, it had become powerful
Hatuncollao descendants Zapana, and tyranny wanted to take all that region. As the founder of
Cuzco, Manco Capac, hobo married to his sons and associates of his service some people with love and
good words with which magnified Curicancha house, after having lived
for many years, died being very old, and we were made the obsequies
with all sumptuosidad, failing which made a package for reverencialle
like a son of the sun.

CAP.

Although he could write what happened in the reign of Inca Roca Sinchi [31], the son the son
of Manco Capac, founder of Cuzco, in this place, I left, thinking the front would have quen confusion
to know entirely how it was taken into the governorship of these gentlemen, because ordered a few laws
and other others, and thus put a mitimaes and other fittings men of war in areas prescribed
in the kingdom's defense, and because they are all things great and worthy of memory, and for
the republics governed by large lawyers and men, desto take notice, and each other devise admiration,
whereas as in barbarians and had no letter was found that a certain know that hobo and in
government and in subduing the land and nation, because under a monarchy Obey a man who was
only worthy to reign sovereign in the Inca empire had, which were more than two hundred miles
and miles of coastline, well, not to vary that that some say that certain Dellos constituted
what one and others another, in which many vary natural, put in this place that I understood
and I have indeed, according to the dello relationship that took in the city of Cuzco and the
relics that we have been WITH THESE all things in Peru habemos walked. Do not look to the letores
that in making this I leave the order that the book should be leading, so that they understand
more clearly what sets, as stated, and this will very soon, not wanting
to do small things to count, you always run away, and so, I will continue
to treat herself the reign of the Incas and succession of them, until
the death of Huascar and the Spanish entry is over.

Y I want you to know that this may read, that of all the Incas, who were eleven, three left bastantísimos
including for the governorship of his lordship, who have not just dried apricots of loarlos,
and these are not Paresce in both conditions as in the trial, which are Huayna Capac, Inca Tupac
Yupanqui, his father, who Inca Yupanqui, a father and grandfather of another. And also it can
be assumed, that because these were so modern that the kingdom is filled Indians who knew Tupac
Inca Yupanqui, and he walked in the wars, and his parents heard what Inca Yupanqui did at
the time of his reign, could be these things, views [32] almost eyes, have more fire power
to tell, and what happened to the others Gentlemen, your proxinitores, dello have long since
forgotten.
