 Bringas aware of this craving Carolina, launched with all the vigor of his mind the cry
of eureka. He would be the versifier.

"I, madam, I ...»-- stammered, barely containing the artistic fervor
that filled his soul.

- It's true ... You do know that like many
other things.

You're so clever ...

- What color is your hair?

- Now you see it - "Mom said opening, not without emotion, a box that had been candy, and it
was blue and pink tank funeral memories -.

You see what braid ... is a beautiful brown.

- Oh, yes, proud! - Uttered Bringas trembling with joy -.

But we needed a little blonde.

- Rubio? ... I have of all colors. You see those curls of my Arturín that I died three years.

-
Rich tone.

Is pure gold ... And this blond?

- Ah, the hair of Joaquin. She was cut to ten years. What a pity!
It seemed a painting.

It was a pain to put the scissors in his head that incomparable ... but the doctor did not want
compromise.

Joaquin was recovering from a sunstroke, and his face was barely
visible etiolated in that sun with hair.

- Well, well, we have two
shades of brown and blond.

To sing it would not hurt a little black ...

- We will use Rosa's hair.

Daughter, bring me one of your additions.

D. Francis took, not excited, but ecstatic, the mane that was offered.

"Now say something stammering ...-- -. Because you see, Carolina ...
I have an idea ... the I watching.

It is a cenotaph in the field funeral, with willows, many flowers
... It is night.

"

- What night?

- I mean, to give melancholy landscape of substance, it should put everything in some darkness
... There will be water there, there, far away, a tranquiiiila surface, a polished espeeeejo
... Do you understand me? ...

- What is it?, "Water glass ...?

- A lake, lady, one, kind of bay. Mind you: the willow branches extend
well ... as if it dripped.

Through the foliage is hard to see the disk of the moon, whose pale light audience the tops of the
distant hills, and produces a temblorcito ... Are you?, A temblorcito
on the surface ...

- Oh, yes ... water.

Understood, understood.

What happens to you ...!

- Well, madam, for this nice effect would take me a few gray hairs.

- Jesus, gray! ... I giggled trouble you for one thing we have so about ... You see my harvest,
Mr. D. Francisco. I would not want to provide you in such abundance these moonbeams that it needs
... With this addition (Taking a long and hearty.) gray hair will not cry you by ...

Brinker took the white lock of hair, and with the others, oprimiolo all against your chest spasm
artist. He had, oh joy!, Two-tone gold, clear and shiny silver, ebony and sienoso brown and
romantic that it had to be the dominant note.

"What we expect of the righteousness of you - Carolina said, hiding the distrust with courtesy
- is that in no case enter into the work that is not our hair. Everything hair has to do with
family. "

- Lady, for Christ's sake!

... "I think you can adulterate ...?

- No ... no, if you do not say ... Is that artists, when they are driven by inspiration (Laughing)
lose all idea of ??morality, and so to achieve an effect ...

- Carolina! ...

He left the house a good friend, feverish and tembliqueante. His epileptic condition of the artistic
gestation. The work, recently embodied in his mind, and with intimate announced rebullicios
I was a living being, and developed potent pressing the walls of the brain and exciting nervous couple,
who had unexplained sensations of choking to breath, to hormiguilla epidermis, a restless
limbs, and being all impatience, fear, I do not know what else ... At the same time his imagination
was given away in advance with the image of the work, already appeared kidding, throbbing, complete,
finished, in the shape of the mold to be. Other times one appeared to be born in parts, hovering
now a member, then another, until all appeared in the entire kingdom of light. My patient
saw the cenotaph of mixed idealistic orders of architecture, the
angel weeping willow with its branches hanging ruefully, as drivel
that you fall into the sky, the flowers all over the floor enamelled,
the terms remote lake with all the sadness and lunacy ... Interrupting
this beautiful vision of non-work cream, flamed in the brain of the
artist as wisps mode (natural add something as funeral), some ideas
atañederas budget work.

Bringas the caressing, by providing care that practical man who did not rule on spasmodic him
the uneasiness of the great creation. Mentally counting, said:

"Shellac: Two and a half reales. A pull all five will spend real ... Florist tongs, as the ones I have
are a bit thick: three real. A very clean glass: real and a half. Four pistils dozens of very tiny,
unless you can make hair, which I will try: two and a half. Total: fifteen reais. Then comes the
most expensive, which is the convex glass the framework, but I use the embroidered dog of my cousin
Joseph, giving a hand glitter. Finally, with glitter, convex glass, hanger and unexpected
... come to matter all about twenty-eight to thirty real. "

The next day was Sunday, he set to work. Not liking any of the designs funeral monument in his
collection had resolved to make one, but such was not the card by the invention, composed, with
parts taken from different works, the whole securely locked previously described. Willow came
to the tomb of Napoleon in St. Helena, and the angel pouted the mound had been placed in the
Escorial for the funeral of a Women's Fernando VII, and the background was taken from a grabadito
not know what tome Lamartinesco that he was a pure syrup. Finally, the flowers harvested in
Bringas garden of an illustrated book on the language of those who came from the library Dona Candida.

This
preliminary work took the artist drawing an average week, and was so pleased him, he had granted
to himself in the silence of false modesty, ardent congratulations. "It's all so typical -
Pipaón enthusiastically telling the smart - which seems to be watching still waters and the rays
of the moon making it as a light tickle ...».

Bringas stuck on the drawing board, and put the glass up, adapting and fixing so that no one could
move.

This done, the rest was pure work of skill, patience and neatness. Was to be expressed with
hairs stuck on the upper surface of the glass all lines of the drawing underneath was, really tricky
task because of the difficulty to manage something as subtle and elusive as the human hair. At
least the main lines bad, but when it came to represent shadows, lined by more or less fine,
the employed artist series of hair cut to size, which was carefully gluing with shellac, hot
streak to mimic chisel steel plate or boxwood. In very fine inks, Bringas was extreme and subtilized
his art to become what microscope. He was an innovator.

No capilífice had discoursed until then to score points hair, picking this with scissors to
get little bodies that appeared to molecules, and paste then these
points near each other, never together, so that would imitate the
point of intaglio.

Used for this very fine brushes, and even birds feathers edged with saliva; and then minced
on a glass hair, was taking each point to put in place, previously smeared with paint. The combination
of tones increased the tangled verbosity of this work, since for harmonic results, it was appropriate
to put here brown, black beyond, by this other part blonde, gold angel hair, silver in all that
was below the jurisdiction of the moonlight. But all that blessed triumphed. And why not, if
your hands seemed to not touch things, if vision was like a lynx, and her fingers had to be
fingers of the breeze that caresses the flowers without ajarlas? ... What a devil of a man! Would
been able to do a string of grains of sand, if you put it, or reproduce the cathedral of Toledo
in a hazelnut shell.

The entire month of March took him in the memorial and the willow, whose leaves were sprouting one
by one, and in mid-April was the angel arms and head.

Many saw this wonder quedábanse captivated by the originality and beauty of it and put a D.
Francisco between most eminent artists, ensuring that if he saw such a extranjerazo work, some inglesote
rich type that usually come to Spain in search of good things, give a cheer for her of money
and would lead to countries who appreciate the works of genius. Bringas had his workshop in
the hollow of a huge window overlooking the Campo del Moro ...

Because the family lived in the palace in a second floor rooms that serve shelter employees
of the royal family.

Enthralled with the work of hair, I forgot to say that back in February of 68 D. Francisco was appointed
first officer of the Municipality of Real Heritage with thirty thousand
pieces of salary, medical manor, pharmacy, water, firewood and other
advantages inherent in the vicinity regia.

Such canonjía realize the aspirations of his life, and will not change
his position so that Thiers high, safe and respectful to the chair
of the Primate of Spain.

Embittered his satisfaction the voices that ran in that year 68 convicted whether or not there
horrific conditions, and fear that the so-called revolution finally broke out with a bang.
Although the idea of ??finishing of the monarchy always sounded good in the brain of man as an
absurd idea, sort of as the imbalance of the planetary orbs, where in a café or gathering heard
predictions binge, blind ads or gloomy comments about how bad they were the government and
Queen, came a shiver, and his heart contracted until brought to an, in his opinion, the size
of an acorn.

One hundred and twenty four steps needed to upload D. Francisco Women's ladder for get from the second
floor patio of the Palace, which is flat with the third being a true city, set on the magnificent
ceiling of the royal abode. This city, where alternate peacefully aristocracy, middle class and people,
is a real republic that the monarchs have corona, and set into its vast circuit, keeps samples
of all different kinds of people. The first time D. Manuel Pez and I went to visit in his
new Bringas home, we were lost in this labyrinth where neither he nor I had ever entered.
Stepping its first site, entering the ladder of Damas, a goalkeeper with three-cornered hat, after
the descent take us, indiconos the way we had to continue to give the our friend's house. "They
twist you left, then right ... There is a ladder. Then down again ... Number 67. "

That if you want! ... We walked through the hallway of red tiles, which I call street or alley in
its magnitude, being lighting in some areas with gas burners and the angles and turns it does.
Here and there we found spaces, which no doubt called squares, flooded with sunlight, which
came through big holes open to patio. The light of day, reflected by the white walls, penetrated
along the walkways, alleys, tunnels or whatever call them, are lost and fainted in them, to
death in full view of the red gas fans, that fluttered trembling
within a circle and smoked under a brass canopy.

Found ourselves everywhere paneled doors, some freshly painted, faded
and moth-eaten other, numbered: but in any discovered the figure that
we sought.

This saw pending a luxurious silk cord, removal of the upholstery palace, in that a frayed string.
With such a sign accusing some fix and clean homes, other disorder
or lack; and pieces of carpet mat poking out under the doors also
told us aposentación something special in the interior.

Unoccupied homes found ourselves with cobwebbed doors, rusty gates, and some holes covered
with wire netting blowing broken bringing us the mist the air stays cold lonely. In certain places
we went to neighborhoods seemed abandoned, and the vaults of unequal height sad echo returned
sound of our footsteps. We climbed a ladder, go down another, and I think we turn up, as resolved
to seek for ourselves the lucky number, not wondering any passerby preferring the pleasure of
exploration effort as mysterious places. The idea of ??losing not annoyed us much, because beforehand
savored the taste hand out at last port without the help of practical and by virtue of our own topographical
instinct. The labyrinth us appealed, and on, on forever, we were soon lit by the sun and by
the gas, describing angles and more angles. Here and there on some open ventanón terrace we corrected
the defects of our defeat, and looking at the dome of the chapel fijábamos orientábamos us and
our true position.

"Here - Pez said impatient - you can not come without a blueprint and navigational compass.
This should The wing of the South. Look at the ceilings of the Hall of Columns and the stairs
... What moles! ".

Indeed, large pyramidal shapes lead lined showed us the big roofs in which the bottom surface
are Volatín Bayeu Angelone.

At best, always walk, we were in a confined area that received the
light of skylights in the roof open, and we had to go back for departure.

Looking outside the correct mass of the castle, do not understand
the irregularities that made people in its upper floors.

Is that over a century there has not been done more to modify a troche and early distribution
Moche, walling around here, opening there, condemning stairs widening some rooms at the expense
of other, turning the street into housing and housing street, boring
walls and closing gaps.

There are stairs that begin and no end; lobbies or squares that are
whitewashed room ceilings were lower.

There lofts where once there were rooms, and rooms that were once
a graceful staircase box.

The snail is found at various points, without knowing where they
are going to stop, and doors septate, hollow with chicken wire, behind
which is no more loneliness, dust and darkness.

A place where we Pez said: "This is a popular neighborhood."

We saw a half dozen boys soldiers playing with paper hats, cane swords
and rifles.

Further, in a wide space and lit by large picture window with bars,
ropes to dry clothes on us forced to lower his head to keep going.

On the walls are not painted dolls missing or improper registrations. Not a few doors of the
houses were open, and through them saw cooking with steaming pots and borders the shelves edged paper.
Some women washing clothes in large coffers, others were combing
out of doors, as it were, in the middle of the street.

"Van you lost" - told us that big boy was holding a yellow cloth wrapped.

- We search the house of D. Francisco Bringas.

- Bringas? ... ya, I know - said an old woman who was sitting next to the big gate -. Here nearby.
You have no more to go down the spiral staircase first and then make a U- back ... Bringas,
yes, the sexton of the chapel.

- What are you saying, ma'am? We seek the first official of the Administration.

- Then it will be down on the terrace. You know you go to the source?

- No.

- Do you know the steps of Cáceres?

- Nor.

- Do you know the chapel?

- Do not know anything.

- And the chorus of the oratorio? What pigeon?

Result: did not know any part of that labyrinthine village made of corners, Burladero and surprises,
fancy architecture and mockery of symmetry. But our inability not gave up, and reject offers
of a boy who wanted to be our guide.

"We are on the wing of the Plaza de Oriente, to wit, in the opposite hemisphere that lives our
friend - Fish said with some emphasis geographic character of Jules Verne -. Resolve to move
to the West Wing, for which we offer insurance counseling through
the dome the Chapel and the ceiling of the staircase.

Once possessed of the body of the West, we be foolish not to give
the house Bringas.

I'm not going back over here without a good map, Compass ... and provisions of mouth. "

Before leaving for this second stage of our journey, we look for the beautiful ventanón overview
of the Plaza de Oriente and the part of Madrid that since there is
discovered, with more than fifty domes, steeples and bell towers.

Philip IV's horse seemed like a toy Teatro Real a hut, and the upper surface of the cornice
of a wide bridge Palace over the precipice, where he could run comfortably not suffer vertigo.
Below from where we were the pigeons had their nests, whom we watch rush into the deep abyss of the
Plaza, in pairs or in groups, and super fast then curve up to perch on capitals and moldings.
Their lullabies seem so inherent to the building as the stones that
compose it. In the infinite hollow mountain that lives made the savage
republic pigeons, occupying it with regional and uncontested dominion.
They are parasites that live between wrinkles in the epidermis of
the colossus. It is well known that care nothing for the revolution;
or that free air, or that secular rock is nothing that disturbs the
domain augusto these queens unchallenged and incontrovertible.

Walk.
Pez had acquired in the geographic notions Verne booklets, they are
missed practical and every step I said, "Now we are on the south ...
We necessarily find the passage from west to our right ... We can
go down without fear of this second floor staircase Spiral ... Well
... Where are we? You do not see the dome, not a sad lightning. We
in the dark realms of gas ... Then go back up by this other step that
comes at hand ... What is this? "We are again in the East wing? Yes,
because looking the courtyard through the window, the dome is our
right ... Believe me, this forest chimneys cause me dizziness. I seem
to navigate and that all this mass tumbles like a boat. On this side
seems to be the source, because women come and go with pitchers ...
Ea, I I pay, I ask practical, I do not give a step further ... We
walked more than half a league and I can not with my body ... A guide,
a guide, and take me out of here soon. "

Providence deparonos our
salvation in the person of considerable Garcia's widow Grande, which
suddenly seemed out of one of the ugliest and most rusty doors saw
that on our side.

How we rejoice that encounter, I must not say.
She, however, it seemed unpleasantly surprised, coma person who does
not want to be seen in improper places hierarchy. His first words,
spoken in fits and mixed with formula greeting, he confirmed my thinking.

"I
beg you not pass, because this is not my home ... I've installed here
temporarily while they arranged the room below where it was the general.
Is this a horror, a terrible thing ... His Majesty insisted that Palacio
had to settle in and I could not refuse to it ... "Candidita I can
not live away from you ... Candidita, come with me ... Candidita,
have everything up empty ... "Nothing, nothing, for the palace
