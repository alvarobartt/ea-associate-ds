 Reflected after all, with maturity and resolution who asked
the critical circumstances in which it was, that pastor facilitóle 200 mules he asked, and made
a bet on the post Morara, distant three leagues Moxo, highway Potosi, and at the same time meant
he could not alter all orders to continue their march, to join with Flores and save the city of La
Plata that was so carefully by the blockade that made him suffer the Indians, under the leadership
of the two brothers Cataris, whose loss would be responsible for their detention, without any
delay and said some items, for occupied by roads and pregnant women to step forward because
it is addressed, with order to observe the movements of the enemy, with some distance and
concealment, sought certification of the true intention of those troops. Full of confidence
and reinforced something with them, believed that shortly before they had no recourse but
to escape, was launched the same evening of that day, March 16, and field Moraja all appearance
of the night at the camp, taking precautions to avoid the serious risk that threatened him everywhere.
He put the tents, campfires, and dinner with the troops soon, and end of the day again ordered
to take refresher mules I had anticipated, leaving the camp with only 20 men in charge of a
veteran official was moving with great caution and silence, and they left right at the Suipacha
town of La Plata Road, took the left, who led Tupiza, preventing the officer was in the field,
take care with accuracy and security, remain on fires, and pass the word all night, also leaving
the order, so that before the new day dawn broke camp, and follow in his footsteps with the luggage
and baggage he had left.

This movement was performed with both order and military prowess, which eluded the careful vigilance
with which they watched the rebels, who were shocked to the first
lights the next day, not knowing how, and where they had disappeared
Reseguin.

Tupiza Moraya far 10 miles of very rocky road, half slopes and gullies, and half of the deep
ravine, where a river drops to wade many times, and as two leagues from that town, it is inevitable
a narrow half a quarter of a league that can not go more than two men in front, and sides
have steep crags of extraordinary height, forming a winding alley, well adapted to a small
number containing male and resist the most numerous army. Indians were not ignorant of the excellence
of that position, as experience has shown that knowledge and skill for the election advantageous
situations, reason why he had chosen to oppose the first resistance the troops of the King,
considering that when they reach it, they would be tired to overcome obstacles, which by degrees
grew, and as they approached, because the natives the way, we added on this occasion the river
flow, which in some fords spent with hard work and no little danger, heightened by the darkness of
night. Overcome with diligence and record all odds, came to the natural troop strength to that
art could not add circumstance, which is recognized by certain items that were formed of the
Spanish fugitives were practical ground, and found it empty, and continued progress, not without
some shock, because when it was in the middle of danger, there was a snap of the sling and some
stones were hurled from the top. All were suspended, believing they had been felt by the enemies,
but the commander, encouraged his resolution, turned and said, "and the danger is inevitable,
what matters is to leave him soon." And fueling the pace, he commanded all to follow him: in
fact, managed to cross the narrow without resistance, and go to another more spacious ravine where
he had already taken place for the imagination to justified hopes for a happy success. No instant
Reseguin miscarried, and making high met his extensive training by the regular effects of the pass,
extended his his forehead allowed him as the greatest width of the road, divided the 200 men
who had five divisions, four of a kind, under the command of veteran officers, and most was to theirs.
Each one said a villager, to be directed and bet on the spot noted, and after talking to his
soldiers with courage, representing its obligation, who were to observe the order, obedience
and resolution in the act, dubbed the care and silence to go to Tupiza. Came to this town at 4
am on day 17, and sent immediately surrounding the games, which occupied the entire circumference,
so that no come out of it, and with it came through the main street and headed to the main square
but until then he had felt his neighbors or the rebels who were delivered sleep with more
confidence, and by the contempt that made the small number of troops which threatened, for
the distance at which they were the preceding day.

His first care was to ensure the main leader Luis Laso de la Vega, which set by himself lived
in the house, calling his name, to which he replied bitterly, because it was uncomfortable,
but reproduced from the outside that was in great danger, because were already very close to
King's arms, stood up, half-dressed and appeared in person at the door with a blunderbuss in
hand. But beating the action, stood a visit to see that expected, lacking movement, even to give
impetus to trigger regular effects causes to the traitors of the
magnitude of his crime, to the Judge, who await punishment.

Siguiéronse prison without halting its secretary, Fermin Aguirre, sugeto Spanish and not of common
birth, who for the ambitious fantasy of having appointed Viceroy of that province, embraced the
seditious party, and others who were decorated with several titles, to divide the husband
of the four that had been proposed rule: and exhalation as a visiting its troops commanded all near
the village, at two miles away, who managed to secure to the other accomplices of the mob.
So, afternoon were 100 inmates in the prisons of the main and most had distinguished themselves
in this conspiracy. Were taken by the commander after all precautions and Orders convenient
to make a sorpesa, and those required to resist the rebels, if they tried to invade the town,
as stated, to liberate their leaders. Placed double advanced guard, chose the church to make
a last stand, ordered rounds, appointed patrol, ordered the accuracy of the service, and increased
their vigilance and care in proportion increasing their risk. Militia called Suipacha people,
who were by the King and Tarija, reinforcing the few relics that had remained faithful, and before
unfair that they could recover the terror instilled by arms of the Sovereign, the resolution
of that operation, the unexpected imprisonment of their leaders, and of all the circumstances action
as occurring in particular, named items to avoid the damage that followed on all bounds of the province
that were moved, and that the rebels committed atrocious cruelties, forcing the inhabitants to come
fugitives Spanish, to welcome the shadow of the newly arrived troops. Diary was helpless widows
and orphans afflicted, that by abandoning their farms, and home comforts, they met in Tupiza to
Commander exposes his sufferings, with the loss of his parents, husbands and property which I had
taken the rigor of tyrants, aggressors, who egercitaron their barbarism, with more excess elsewhere
in the minerals we took, Ubinas, Tatasi, Portugalete and Great Chocalla, insulting to the priests,
desecrating the temples, and committing the most sacrilegious deaths in them, large theft, shattering
the mills, and destroying the work mine. Reseguin Oíales affably, consoled them all with tenderness,
and looking ofrecíales for them, as a parent beneficial for their children, promised to restore
them their property, and shed the last drop of blood in its defense, and for such a just cause.

The
sedition of this province had some circumstances, which is more frightening to the general
that undergoes in Peru, and could have given much care, unless it been cut so timely progress. The
principal author and head of her, Luis Laso de la Vega, was caste cholos, more Spanish than Indian,
and was serving sergeant as those militias, whom was accompanied by a bold and some special
genius that they made a distinction between his own. This wicked, favored by the mayor, D. Francisco
Garcia de Prado, corresponded to his benefactor with the greatest ingratitude, forging this
plot, to usurp the command of the provinces of Chichas, Lipes, Cinti and Porco, taking advantage
of fermentation that had caused the edicts and measures of main commissioners Tupac Amaru rebels,
and other movements, which also forced the mayor to collection of some ammunition, and to assemble
in Tupiza militia regiment of that name, cholos and mestizos compound, which served Laso,
who was called to his ambitious and daring thoughts, March 6, taking
the spot of the journal, to touch the spirits of his fellow soldiers,
who were soon to be seduced, and shaking the reins of obedience, began
dictating to them how excesses will and suggested to the leader egemplo
which followed the Indians and the village surrounding, growing in
such turmoil acceleration, which disappointed Prado of any fruit they
produced their persuasion and authority, had no recourse but to seek
asylum in his house with some of their own.

Besieged in Laso it with a flood crowd, vainly tried to break his horse sometimes favorable than
it had to be on the run and run the risk that at moments grew, but their efforts were useless
watching to find out, decided to defend until ultimately favored the doors and windows of
your house, from where it started to fire at the crowd that had surrounded him, which made
the same way; lasting the confusion until midnight, when dead and some other tired and weak to continue the
defense, the rebels managed to burn down the house, and blow up the spare powder that had collected
for munitions that troop, and dropped a canvas wall penetrated to corral the Indian Nicolas Martinez,
and found her dazed in a corner mayor, approached to him and promptly beheaded him, and he
drank much of his blood. Could have been saved if undertaken in advance would escape, as well as advising
some sugetos intentioned, but it was less sensitive die than abandon their interests acquired
at the expense of general discontent, which put him in that state and situation.

After the assailant released the death of his mayor and others who accompanied him, entered the
rebels at home, inasmuch as it had been ransacked, and during the night made many excesses and disorders
in the population and its surroundings, as in the estate of Salo, where Indians encouraged
by the example of Tupiza, plotted against its owner, D. Paxsi Salvador, whom was beheaded and
captured the substantial assets she possessed: through which and others of like nature, Laso rid
of that could cause sugecion sugetos, and now free from this obstacle, he thought only the domain
to ensure that proposed. It headlined Governor and Captain General of that province by Tupac Amaru,
by issuing without loss of time, his secretary Aguirre, circulars and announcements for all
the jurisdiction in which ordered, under the severe penalties, join him to contribute to the defense
common, shake the misrule and oppression in which the magistrates had placed the customs, excises
and other branches of finance, again established. The parish priest of villa, Dr. D. José Dávalos,
tried to dissuade them from the principles and quiet, using the most humble supplications and
efficient trades, but did not get more than permission to give burial to the bodies, whose
diligence practiced with the greatest piety, was not enough to contain such tensions, which lost
the obedience and respect to justice, they soon also lost in the Lord's house, entering it as a
portion riotously Indians filled with rage, they dug up the corpse of Prado, and cut off his
head, took the audience de la Plata, as declared some, or his Inca, according deposed others.
The truth is, the Indian governor of the town of Santiago de Cotagaita, who had remained loyal to
the center of the rebellion, sought and gave him burial in the church
its people with all due solemnity, and turned to the Indians that
led to suffer the punishment he justly deserved such a criminal offense,
but this example, neither the repeated measures practiced by some
neighbors honest, prevented all parties submit to pay obedience to
the usurper, the chiefs, governors, second and curacas, ensuring support
their ideas to sacrifice their lives and property for freedom.

Such was the state in which they were those provinces, when the commander D. José Reseguin came
to them with their small number of troops. The weight of such grave care, and the crowd obstacles
he encountered and that at times were increased, were not enough to stop him nor to intimidate,
rather, knowing how convenient it was not losing a moment in such Occasionally, immediately gave
the highest activity to the remedy of so many grown evil, constantly seeking the most appropriate
and effective remedies to prevent them.
