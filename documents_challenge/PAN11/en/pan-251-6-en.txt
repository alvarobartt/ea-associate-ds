 

Incessantly praised, cheated and stole to the good prince, and each put his hand like qual to
contention in the treasury. The chief minister of finances of the island of Serendib was this beautiful
exemplo, and all the underlings imitate him with fervor. The king, who knew, had moved several
times minister, but had never been able to move the accepted style of dividing the income real into
two unequal parts, the smaller one for his majesty, and more for their managers.

Good King relied Nabuzan his need of the wise Zadig. So many things you know, told him, do not
would know how to stop me with a treasurer who does not steal from me? " Yes indeed, "replied Zadig;
a sure way to pick you know one that has clean hands. Delighted the king asked him, giving him
a hug, as would. No more, "replied Zadig, which aim to Bayle to quanta the dignity of treasurer,
and that baylare lighter, more men will infallibly well. YOU ARE laughing at you, 'said the
king, so by diverting some of choosing a minister hacienda! With more than ready to give whatever
antics in the air has to be the most integrated and more able administrator? I'm not saying
it is to be the most able, "replied Zadig, but I do assure you is that undoubtedly has to be
the most honest. Such was the confidence with Zadig was saying it, that persuaded the king to possess
some secret knowledge supernatural administrators. I do not like things supernatural, he said
Zadig, and I have never bear with patience and men who do miracles, or the books that the mint,
and if you want your majesty allow me to do the test, will be convinced that my secret is so easy
as a single. More Nabuzan was astounded king of Serendib, to hear that the secret was simple,
that if I had said it was miraculous. Okay, I said to you, do as you please. Dexadlo be that
this test will earn more than what you think. That same day he sent a proclamation through name
of the king, who all aspired to employment quantos chief minister of the income Nabuzan his
sacred majesty, Nuzanab son, should come to light silk dresses to the antechamber King, the first
day of the moon's crocodile. Came to the number of sixty-four. Were musicians in a room immediately,
and arranged for a bayle, but the door was closed of the room, and she had to enter through a gallery
quite dark. Came a uxier to drive one after another to every candidate in this passage, where
you only dexaba few minutes. The king was advised, had actually put all their treasures in
the gallery. Quando suitors came to the hall, His Majesty commanded that Bayle, and never had
baylarines seen more moles or with less ease; all went head descends, the backs knees, and hands
attached to the body. What scoundrels! Zadig said in voice descends. To one swiftly moves, head
up, looking serene, the right body, and firm knees. What man so well, what sugeto honest! 'said
Zadig. He gave the king a hug baylarin to this good, and made him his treasurer, all others
were justly punished and fined, because while it had been in the gallery, each one had filled
his pockets, and could hardly take a step. Pitied the king of human nature, contemplating that
sixty baylarines four and sixty-three thieves were thieves, and given to the dark gallery running
title of temptation. Persia had been impaled in the sixty-three magnates; in other countries, had
appointed a court, which had consumed three times the costs stolen money, and had not put a
penny in the royal coffers, in others, would have justified fully, and would have fallen from grace
the lithe baylirin: in Serendib were condemned to increase the treasury, because it was very
Nabuzan item.

Was no less grateful, and gave a sum more quantiosa Zadig that nunra
treasurer had stolen neither the king his master.

Zadig value of this money to send him to Babylon Express report on the fate of Astarte. In giving
this order, her voice trembled, he rushed the blood towards the heart, is covered with a dark
veil their eyes, and stood on the point of death. Departed the post, board violates Zadig, and
returned to the palace, where without seeing anyone, and believing I was in his room, gave
the name of love. Yes, the love, the king said, that just question, and you have guessed the cause
of my pain. What a great man you are! I hope to teach me to know a strong woman, as I have done to
find a disinterested treasurer. Returning Zadig itself promised to serve in his love as he had done
in real estate, but seemed the most difficult undertaking yet.

CHAPTER XV.

Blue eyes.

My body and heart, the king said to Zadig ... Hearing these words could not help the Babylonian
to terminate his Majesty, and say, welcome Ouanto you have not told my soul and heart, because
we do not hear more voices that are in talks of Babylon, or read books do not address the heart
and soul, written by authors who have neither of them; but forgive me, Lord, so continue. Nabuzan
continued: My body and my heart are prone to love at the first of these two powers has plenty
of satisfaction, that I have a hundred wives at my disposal, all beautiful, obliging, obsequious,
and voluptuous, or pretending are with me. However my heart is not so lucky, because I have
had the most experience that flattered the King of Serendib, and they do very little appreciation
of Nabuzan. Why not I say that my wives are unfaithful because I want to find a like for me
own, and she turned a hundred beauties possess. Tell me if my hundred sultanas is a who really
loves me.

Zadig answered the same thing about the minister of finance. Lord dexadlo to my office; but
first let me have all the riches that were exhibited at the gallery of temptation, and do not
hesitate to give you a good account of them, and not lose a jot. The king gave him broad powers,
and chose Zadig humpback thirty-three the most ugly Serendib, thirty-three pages of the most
beautiful, and thirty-three of the most eloquent and strongmen monks. Dexóles power to all
toilets introduced in the sultanas; Hunchback gave to each four thousand gold coins to give away,
and the first day were all happy. The pages that had no other gift that you make your person,
take two or three days in getting what they requested, and had more difficulty in leaving his
non bonzes; but after they surrendered thirty-three devotees. Witnessed the king of all these
tests by giving a lattice in the chambers of the sultanas, and was stunned that their one hundred
ninety-nine wives surrendered to his presence. There was one very young and very novice to the qual
had never touched his majesty: arrimáronse to it one, two and three humps, ofrecréndole twenty thousand
pieces, but remained incorruptible, laughing at the idea of ??the humpback they thought their
money made them more beautiful. Presented themselves the two most beautiful pages, and they he
said that the king seemed nicer. Bonzo Acometióla then the most eloquent, and then the more
adventurous: at first I tried to talkative, and could not understand was the merit of qual second.
Everything is put at the heart, said: "I shall not transfer or the gold of a hunchback, or
to the beauty of a page, or to the arts of a Buddhist monk, and I wish to anyone but Nabuzan; Nuzanab
son, waiting for him to me appropriate. King was arrested in joy, love and admiration. He returned
to take all the money that had bought the humpback good chance, and gave to the beautiful
Falida, which was the name this beauty. With him gave him his heart, he deserved to spare, because
it never looked brighter and more youth flowery yours, never beauty that was more worthy of
pledge. It is true that history is not silent than to misspell a courtesy, but confesses that
Baylan as fairies, sing like sirens, and talked like the Graces, and was full of skill and virtue.

Adorábala
Nabuzan beloved but Falida had blue eyes, caused the most dire qual
misfortunes.

It was forbidden by an ancient law of Serendib, who fell in love with one of the women who Greeks later
called BOOP, and to more than five thousand years had passed this bonzo the supreme law, by appropriating
to himself the lady of the first king of the island of Serendib, for so that the curse of
the blue eyes had made fundamental law of the state. All classes of states made strong representations
to Nabuzan, and publicly stated that arrival was the fatal catastrophe of the kingdom, which
was filled to the extent of the abomination, threatening event that an accident of nature, in
short, that Nabuzan, son of Nuzanab, was in love with two blue eyes tear. The humpback, the
monks, the contractors, and the black-eyed bad-happy tainted the entire kingdom.

Universal discontent encouraged to savage peoples living north of
Serendib to invade Nabuzan good states.

Subsidies requested his subjects, and the monks who owned half of state revenues, were content
to raise his hands to heaven, and refused to take their money out of breath treasury to the
king. Beautiful singing prayers in music, and dexáron the barbarians ravaged the state.

Dear Zadig, "Take me out of this horrible predicament? said to him
in piteous tone Nabuzan.

With much taste, "replied Zadig, the monks will give you money quanto distributions. Leave the
land where have raised their palaces and defendais no more than yours. Nabuzan did so, and Quando
monks came to lie at his feet, imploring his assistance, he answered them King with a superb
music whose lyrics were prayers to heaven, praying for conservation of their land. Then the
monks gave money, and happily concluded the war. Of Thus blessed by his prudent advice, and the
most important services, had Zadig brought the irreconcilable enemy of the most powerful state,
sworn in loss The monks and Oji-black desacreditáronle humpback and settlements, and we did suspect
the good Nabuzan. The services that the man does remain in the anteroom, and suspicion enter the
cabinet, according to Zoroaster. Every day new charges were, the first is repelled, the second
makes a dent, the third wound, and the fourth killed.

Scared Zadig, who had put the issues on the rise of his friend, and
sent her money, no thought more than part of the island and go in
person to know news of Astarte, because if I stay in Serendib, he
said, I will impale the monks.

"But where shall I go? Egypt I'll be a slave, according to Saudi appearances burned and hanged
in Babylon. With all necessary is to know what became of Astarte: Partamona, and troubles that
I intended my luck fatal.

CHAPTER XVI.

The bandit.

On arriving at the borders between Saudi petrea of ??Syria, and to pass along to a strong castle,
left him a few armed Arabs. Saw himself surrounded by men who shouted: Give it up, all quanto
bring ours, and your person belong to our master. In response took Zadig the sword, so did the
young man who was brave, and to the lifeless dexáron first Arab that had rammed: doubled the
number of enemies, but they are not discouraged, and resolved to die in the fight. Víanse two men
defended themselves against a multitude; little contest so unequal could last. Looking from
a window the owner of the castle, Arboga named, the wonders of value to Zadig, charged him esteem.
Baxo therefore and came in person to restrain the sujos, and freed the two walkers. Quanto for
my land problem is mine, he said, not less than that encounter strange land, but you seem to me as
courageous, that I was exempt from the common law. Made him into the castle, ordering his troops
to treat him well, and wanted dinner that night with Zadig.

Was the master of this castle one of those Arabs who called thieves, the qual-thousand atrocities
used to do some good action, robbed with a furious rapacity, and gave lavishly: fearless in action, in
a good mood in the treatment of life, drinking at the table, good Quando had drunk humor, and above
all without any overlaps. Gustóle much Zadig, and the conversation which encouraged the banquet
last long. Arboga finally said to him: Aconsejoos you to take the game with me, you can not
do better, not so bad the office, and one day you can become what I am. Can you tell, "replied
Zadig, since Quando exercitais so noble profession? From child, "replied the master. It was
an Arab servant very clever, and could not get used to my state, desperate to see that land
belonging equally to all, I would not fit to me the relevant portion. My faithful old sentence
to an Arab, the qual said to me: "Son, do not despair, know ye that in ancient times had a grain
of sand that ached to be an atom stranger in a desert walk, he became a diamond, and is today
the most precious jewel in the crown of King of the Indies. Given me so much blow that answer, that
being grain Sandy Diamond I venture again. I won the first two horses, I joined with colleagues, I went
down shortly in the state of stealing caravans little flooding, and so was to reduce the disproportion
that I had to others. I participated in the goods of this world, v indemnified me with interest:
tuviéronme much, I became Mr. bandit stole this castle took him by force. He wanted her off the
satrap of Syria, but was already so wealthy that had nothing to fear: I gave money the satrap,
and preserve the castle, and enlarge my land, adding to them the charge I gave the satrap of treasurer
of the taxes paid by the Saudi petrea the King of Kings.

I made collections, and was relieved of payments.

Desterham sent here the great Babylon, on behalf of King Moabdar, to a satrapilla for hung. Quando
he arrived with the order, I was informed of everything, I hang on His presence the four persons
who brought them to tighten the noose around his neck, and asked quanto then you could invoke
the commission to hang myself. He replied that could gratification up to three hundred gold
coins, and I made do with evidence that would win me over: bottom bandit created him, and today
is one of the best and richest official that I have, and if you want me to believe, you will do
the same. Has never run better time to steal, since Moabdar has been killed, and who walks
in Babylon repite. Moabdar was dead! he said Zadig: What has been done the Queen Astarte? I
do not know, "replied Arboga, I do know, is Moabdar that went crazy, which was dead, that Babylon
is made a den of thieves throughout the empire in desolation, which
can give good shots, and I for my part I taken some Ballant
