 Every time fixed in the soil one
of her little feet, frightened frogs in the grass were hidden, and gave great jumping, splashing
in stagnant water. The noise was the water, Frogs duck it was the only thing that interrupted
the strange silence that reigned around.

Poldy, by hasty and curious instinct, he walked by the banks of the lagoon to the site where
the tower looked like. And being already very close to him, suddenly saw an object that although
she was not shy, I was a nervous shaking, for being so suddenly and when least suspicious.
He was a portly white stork, who left behind the tower, and without the slightest fear, but
gentle and serene, it came up with step Poldy slow, grave and majestic. Occasionally shook
his head from side to side with a graceful coquetry. When was closer, took a few hops, extended
and long wings flapped as a sign of joy, and repeatedly opening and closing the red peak, was
a son very similar to castanets. Turning then to walk more slowly and with some hesitation,
as if respect him contained, kept walking toward the bird pilgrim Poldy, and stopping every
two or three steps as if waiting for the permission to get to it.

Poldy understood the intention of the bird, not fear anything because he was considered harmless,
but missed that show him as loving and as resolutely as long strides as he strode spandrels came
to her as if she were an old friend. Would you have known and dealt before and did not remember
then? Poldy sought in vain by all the deepest and forgotten breast of his memory some vague memory
of that knowledge and treatment. Was not the least trace even the slightest trace if any have
ever had. The same could be seen than ever stork Poldy had met because, although could not quite
express in any human language but only casta√±etazos resonant with its peak, slow of gait, their
frequent stops and each of the looks that way to her brown eyes seemed to mean interrogation
Poldy and supplication, as if to say: charming Countess, may I see I close and treats? There was
also in a stork do not know what the exotic: a weird way of being, well similar to that note
in a traveler of distinction, came from very remote countries, with whom by that stumble and
struck up a conversation without thinking or intending, and only because of sudden and mysterious
sympathy.

Poldy undoubtedly sympathized with the stork. I fell in grace and earned him the will to compliance
respectful and friendly, so the stork gently looked at her. Admitted, back in himself, knew
the stork treat people as they deserved, and that naturally was endowed with exquisite good
manners, but because parenting is not learned, but rather should ease called fine or refined touch
of world.

Finally, Poldy acquiesced to treat the stork without anyone present and not knowing who was
or how many quarters did, she gave also to her a few steps, and reached out and pleasing in
his head touched. The stork was left was stroking and satisfaction and caresses those noble taste
caused him, squinting eyelids as if asleep and gently rubbing the long neck on the cover of
the lovely lady. It passed the hand down the neck of a stork, lowering it to the width crop,
all covered with abundant and white feathers. Then he realized with surprise that the stork had
there, suspended ribbon very subtle, a small piece of silk fabric,
which flexible and crowded, was very little bulk.

Poldy could not resist the curiosity or the desire to seize defeat
from that pledge.

Soon So broke the tie bar through the garment hung the bird's neck and was with the garment in her
hands.

It is not known if frightened or angry then the stork which might consider stripping, removed
the lady suddenly, spread his wings, flew, soared into the air and finally out of sight.

Poldy was embarrassed as if he had committed a theft villain, but
in the end, dismissed the scruples, thinking that she had had no intention
of staying with the garment and was ready to return the bird if the
bird came back to it and somehow the claim.

Poldy unraveled after more than a meter of ribbon was wound into the fabric of silk, giving
form of ball, and unwrapped the cloth, which was the color of apricots, was written in it with very
black ink in strange lines and several tiny letters. She looked at them and the Remiro, but
in vain, because no one knew. Though he knew and exploited moderately disciple of his brother,
Count Henry, could not quite intently to determine which alphabet language and those symbols and
words belonged.

He suspected, however, that registration silk fabric were in Sanskrit,
a language he studied assiduously and enjoyment of his brother Count
Henry.

III

Poldy the castle again spurred by curiosity and eager to decipher
his brother he what the web said.

Lunch with very good appetite, and then, while the widowed Countess asleep after lunch, as was
his custom, he went to the library with her brother Henry told him about the bird mosquito,
taught him the silk fabric and begged translate what he had written it.

Count Henry confessed that he was well versed in the language to translate
Valmiki suddenly the verses, as undoubtedly were verses there were
in the fabric, but requested time and promised her sister have an
exact translation of all on the same day.

Indeed, just hours after the count sought Poldy, took her back to the library, and triumphantly
showed him the verses and translated.

- Do not know what to think, he told his sister. Sometimes I imagine that the stork came from
India, where spent the winter, and the verses are the work of a Brahman,
or Nabob Rajah well illustrated, and sometimes, I suspect that it
may be a learned countryman of ours who wrote the verses and who hung
the cloth on the neck of the stork to tease the one who find.

- What
end - Poldy said, was to propose a countryman of ours with that cheating?

I not yet know the verses, but I assured that the author lives on the banks of the Indus or the Ganges,
and not on the Rhine or the Danube. Let's see ... read.

- You'll see and you'll find some inspiration in the verses more European
than Asian.

Compositions are three: two very short, and one of these two seems
modeled on four lines of the Prologue in Heaven of Faust.

The coincidence is unlikely.

    And, although not impossible, I find strange
    and suspicious that a brahman read Goethe
    and imitate him.
    

- Come on, read the verses without further preface.

- The verses say:

    I wish to heaven the brightest star;
    I call this land their fullest; And no
    love near or distant love Touched
    my heart quieted.

- True, "said Poldy, the verses are very similar to those of Goethe, unless the poet self says
what it says Mephistopheles of Faust.

- Well, hear these others who have not stopped metaphysics which Christian
mysticism by Tauler style of the teacher or Eckart:

Without wings
and without light the human mind In vain in search of the ideal is
released; But the will goes boasts The immensity of eternal hope.

-
That's true, - said Poldy, and the same can happen to an Indian, a
Christian.

In India since ancient times, so I've heard, mystics as deep as Germany. Moreover, in all countries,
must have been thinkers and poets to imagine and express that could penetrate and come up with
a love that never goes up and enters the rationale by subtle and large it is.

- I will not argue. I agree that a Brahman may have composed the song that just tell translated.
Maybe I in the translation I have rendered a European look in the original does not. Hear now the
final composition. The poet falls in it lifts mystical, and folds and human as any earthly love with
love and sensuality inspire women. Something, however, is still in the composition of the mysticism
of others. It's like a small piece of the Song of Songs, or better say the Gita-govinda, whose
compliments, tenderness and material descriptions can be interpreted by otherworldly style and
transcendent. The composition in this case also has a uniqueness that has neither the erotic
romance of the Hebrews and the Indians. Crishna Solomon saw, heard and touched beautiful and love
your friends, but this poet or touch or see, or hear his, if not the imagination with vague uncertain,
and in such a manner that it can live on this planet in another very
remote, and the same may be our contemporary, to be born the last
forty centuries or even be waiting another forty in the world of ideas,
before it reaches the day of his incarnation and its occurrence among
people of our caste.

- Very curious is what you tell me, but it is
not original or new.

It's so hard to be new and original! Do not you love Elena Faust, who lived 2500 years before
he was born? Is there no Arabic or Persian tale, where a Muslim prince, who lived two hundred
or three hundred years after Muhammad, is madly in love with some queen or princess of Serendib
or Sheba, which flourished in the days of Solomon and was Sulamita rival?

- All that is true, but even more vague and indeterminate Mrs. thoughts of our Indian poet. The Muslim
prince in love with the rival Sulamita had found and admired the portrait of her father's treasure,
while there is no picture or is there any indication through which to glimpse or have any idea or
notion of his lady, the author of the verses I have translated. Hear them carefully.

- I'm all ears.

    Count Henry read thus:
    
    Where are you hiding, my beauty,
    they do not get to see my eyes, As I dream of my fantasy Full of
grace, free of anger?

    
    
    Come do the Kokila sweet gurgles
    Do pay the lotus aroma in the wind Come see my longing wish And understand
you my understanding.

    
    
    You're not dreaming, you really are;
    Do not pretend these spells soul, Although most beautiful women Yours
will call the immortals.

    
    
    In the pure light in your eyes
    Love lights your darts gold and your lips are sealed ballot box Source
of their pleasure and treasure.

    
    
    Ora reside off the ground Ora show
    up in another age, For the three worlds in rapid flight I will go
looking for you.

    
    
    Bright pearl, though hidden In the deep
    sea are, I find you know, it's my life For me des exalted prize.

Poldy heard the verses carefully and discussed them with his brother and even tried with apparent
critical coldness, giving some merit and pointing out their many flaws. What she concealed and
not revealed or his brother or anyone, was the swarm of assumptions and dreams verses that arose
in his imagination. Already contained writing them an elegant look young brahman, not far from his
magnificent villa, in green bower, on the fertile banks the Kausik√≠, as composed in his own palace
Ayosia Crown Prince of Kashmir or any other of the kingdoms and countries that described the
ancient epics. But the author of the verses was a contemporary of her and looked her end by
the disease and passion that tormented him.

Loved or rather wanted to love, nothing worth seeing around him of his love, and looking away,
blindly and without guidance the rare and precious thing that deserves to be loved.

In the depths of his soul Poldy pondered much on this, and wove and
wove countless stories, their feeling beautiful, with which she delighted
in secret without telling anyone, not even the old governess Justina
who was his confidant.

IV

Engolfad√≠simo in their studies, Count Henry had no will or understanding
but to continuance.

In other matters of life was always subject to the understanding and Poldy will of her sister,
whom he loved greatly. Prohibiole it to speak with one of the meeting of the stork, the verses
and the translation, and Count Henry obeyed and I stopped everything.

Poldy did not want his mother to know of anything. The Dowager Countess was a lady endowed a positive
spirit so prosaically, would certainly have destroyed all his speeches the poetic assumptions pipe
Poldy had risen and that in no way wanted She nobody tear down.

The widowed countess and Zaheri also accused his daughter frequently, calling it extravagant
of dreaming, hallucinations, a staunch enemy of the wise and reasonable,
and reckless unattainable ideal persecuting and absurd.

If the widow Countess of thought and ignoring Poldy the success of the stork, did not they
think and what would not say if he knew?

Poldy not return, then, to talk about him or his own brother, as if his own brother ignore, or as
if she had the pretense that he forgot.

Alone, then, and freely, Poldy be included as they desire, the author of three poems. Already assumed
in Varanasi, and Delhi, and Calcutta, and elsewhere in India, but always noble, young and beautiful,
and Kshatriya or Brahmin, if not a prince.

The unknown character suffered a mental illness similar to Poldy. Symptoms were contempt and
disgust for his surroundings, and the vague desire for a good remote, dimly layout and a half
vanished in the mists and vapors of a thousand dreams.

Poldy discarded by vulgar and foolish belief of his brother, a German
scholar had Sanskrit verses composed for entertainment or to show
their expertise.

For her there was no no doubt: the verses were the work of a distinguished young gentleman from India.

Poldy
We often went further in his bold imagination. She did not believe that the bird mosquito that
had appeared to him had the slightest resemblance or the swan Leda nor the white bull of the brave
daughter of Agenor, but might not be an instrument of the stork a great sage, perhaps a genius
or a fairy, whose powerful suggestions had obeyed coming to visit? Who will dare to limit the extent
possible? If we were not to believe only what we understand, only we would believe anything.

Sometimes
came to the memory of Poldy a story of the Thousand and One Nights, and delighted to boast that
what she had spent some resemblance to the story. In the more elevated regions air, met one
night a fairy and a genie who were flying in opposite directions. There he talked and confided that
the fairy came to visit and leave the most beautiful sleep Prince was in the world, and that
genius, from the other end of the earth, came to contemplate and admire a beautiful princess also
asleep in his bed virgin there in the recesses, elegant and perfumed
boudoir of his magnificent palace.

Genie and Fairy proposed that Prince and Princess to meet, fall in love and marry, and the media
to turn to do up the mess of that history. Poldy, while smoothing much the supernatural, and
modesty, for the skepticism that is so characteristic of the century This, he suspected that
everything that happened could very well be quite naturally something that coincided with the oriental
tale.

She had heard and had even read recent works dealing with Theosophy, which is ? In India, some
scholars called Mahatma, which force and regular introinspecci√≥n Honduras examination in itself
be able to acquire great and rare find secrets of nature, by virtue of which perform actions
that look miraculous, but are not. Would not it be perhaps the author
of three poetry mahatmas any such business that Poldy had guessed,
he had interviewed mentally, he had taken with her and ? to communicate
their views and send infuse his lines without much surprise, half
had used the bird natural√≠simo mosquito, which takes proper condition,
nothing of witchcraft and other evil arts, to spend the summer in
Austria and winter India
