WHICH TEAM IS CECILIA

In the abode of the Belinchón had begun
preparations for wedding.

First, very reserve, Dona Paula Nieves did come to the embroiderer,
and held a long conference with her behind closed doors.

Samples are then asked to Madrid. A few days later, that lady, accompanied by Cecilia and Pablito,
made a trip to the capital of the province, in the family of the house. The spook of Dona Petra,
sister of Don Feliciano Gomez, who went by Rua New alighted while Dona Paula and her children, she
observed the valet pulled the car a portion of packages, it wanted pieces of cloth. Enough
so that everyone knew Sarrió at home of Don Rosendo is already working on the computer of the
eldest daughter. Dona Paula, provided reason, had a suffocation. Snow blamed. It protested that
he had not left word some of his lips. Dona Paula insisted. Cried the embroidery. In short, a disappointment.

Well,
everything had been discovered, no mufflers, and hairs to sea. Constituyóse in back room, which
overlooked the street Caborana, workshop or office linen under senior management of Dona Paula, and
immediate Nieves. It consisted of four officers the two daughters
of the house as household chores are allowed, and Venturita it Cecilia.

It was a boisterous youth, which, active work did not stop talking, laugh and sing all day.
