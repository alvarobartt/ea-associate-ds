 So nervous was the man, that it uncovered
what should be covered, and hid that which enjoys the light of day. There he took out rosaries, scapulae,
a bundle of pawn tickets rolled in a piece of newspaper, pieces of horseshoe picked up from the
streets, animal or people's molars, and other knickknacks. With the search finished, Benina entered,
already back from her task, which she had taken care of so quickly, like she was taken from and
back on wings by the angels of heaven. The poor woman came suffocated from the quick running in the
streets; she barely could breathe, and her sweat covered face emanated
fire, joy from her eyes.

"They have given me three -- she said while showing the coins --, one in quarters. I hadn't small
luck that Valeriano was there; that if the mistress was there, Reimunda,
it would be difficult to get two and change out of them".

Answering to the happiness of the old lady, Almudena, with a face full of joy and triumph, she
showed a quarter between her fingers.

"I found it here in her chest... Grab it Tigo. -- Oh, what luck!

Could she have more? Search well, son. -- it doesn't have more.

I moved things around her chest".

Benina tossed the clothes around the drunkard's clothes hoping to
see a coin jump out.

But nothing jumped out other than two hairpins, and some bits of coal.
"She doesn't have any more".

The blind man kept talking, and by the explanations given by the
character and customs of the big woman, he could understand that if
they had found her sober, she would have given them the quarter just
by asking.
