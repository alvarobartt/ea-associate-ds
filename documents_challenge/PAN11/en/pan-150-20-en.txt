 

COLLECTION OF THE TREASURY.

Funds raised in the Philippines suffers from certain vices that removed, as it is easy, would give
a successful outcome and increase revenue to the treasury. Indeed, the progress of the fundraising
Indian tribute is reduced to charge more or less stringent than are the ministers of public
finances to the mayors and managers of such collection correjidores and This is done by computations
that these mayors go to that office. This adheres to Thus, the same as for trial accounts,
to the ancient instructions rijen in the matter with this or that small modification readopted
as it seemed, according to Messrs. subdelegados superintendents of public finances, which have
varied according to opinion and concept that each has formed. The more strict or moderate their
compliance given their mayors or correjidores subdelegados is the second extreme, and all this
does not happen a charge routinely made wrong and what they should charge, was taken after their
accounts for what they have done and due to perform, the first thing we demand strict, and obrándose
in the latter according to the particular circumstances of each case often seeing that some
mayors to absolve them what uncollected charges, and others were condemned to their payment
because they were not so skilled to justify any cause because it claimed, when in my opinion
no one can authorize the acquittal of the non-charged, excepting the death of a taxpayer, or
the passing of this from one province to another, only ones that
can support them absolve: all else is intrigue, deceit and falsehood.

This anomaly makes clear about how easy it is for correjidores and mayors to defraud the Exchequer
care is not said to be disappointed, but it's easy to happen, and reform to be very simple
at this point, nothing more just and according to it, because the main purpose of the collection
must take the place safer and more clear that is susceptible, and the proceeds put in the best
custody, being unable collectors can not even try the smallest concealment, it is clear that
the more assured is the fundraising, and the greater the care custody, the greater and more
satisfactory than the results will be derived either. This is so look for the modest tribute
from the Indians and mestizos, and the most grown up of the Chinese, office and principal object
in which the mayors correjidores and occupy all his attention, therefore formed to fill the
position, as to have funds available for its traffic and shops, which is the second and main
point of their occupations, as noted, all others care for their jobs are as secondary or accessory,
and we are not strictly binding. The administration of justice, grooming and city police, the
composition and repair of roads and bridges and other public works, everything is looked at
General-with little or no attention, they always engaged in receivables, to cover their position
and acquire funds with which to gather cargo and forwarded to Manila, taking their profits
and increase his fortune many times without noticing the means of doing so, everything else gets
very little attention. Authorized to trade instruction to the state by paying a modest return
for this privilege, entitled pardon to trade, clear and therefore they do with the treasury
funds they collect and administer, using his authority, that some or most of the time used
to cause humiliation and outrages, for if it were not so impossible a mayor would sacase correjidor
or some say the amounts taken out in the short period of three or six years that are provided.
From here, it derives the great vice of these revenues, to wit, that these employees dedicated
to their private businesses, public disregard the destination, using those filling his authority,
to the detriment of the people and damage to the Indians and national interests, it seems, in
the manner with which today are managed, for mainly to form the heritage of the mayors and
correjidores, if their speculation go wrong and if wrong, to cause irreparable loss to the
Treasury. A proof of this Truth is the accumulation of expedients that there is always in
court over accounts of procedures against mayors and correjidores, some failed, and others with long lags
so been administered, and all these debtors to the Treasury. Remove at once to the judges that
trade provinces, and the treasury will earn much, not least for its oppressed peoples authority,
so those who only see their mayors, and disclosed by a parent correjidores its well and good,
dedicated exclusively to fulfilling its ministry, which it served provided the Indians all
the happiness and abundance that they can enjoy if they reform the court system, as indicated
in part on the administration justice, because the circumstances of peoples, their population
and rising wealth so as required and to destroy the obstacles to the development of such interesting
objects in any extent.

For more urjente convince you of this need, it suffices to know that
just by being appointed sugeto correjidor a mayor or, as is believed
rich, and even in Spain, mainly in Court, has spread the voice enough
to be mayor of a province of the Philippines to become rich: much
has this to exaggeration, and fully in practice there are many sad
disappointments but it is also true that some, not many, who had nothing,
to be administered a province three or six years, fortunes have risen
thick, it may be deducted as fill the duties of his employment, and
as justice to the people entrusted to them, and how they have handled
public funds.

In view of this demonstration, the supreme Government of the Metropolis will deign to take into
consideration the grounds that it exposes to proceed as soon as possible to the reform, the
principles of justice as well as the circumstances require so interesting for industry.

But it is noted that having no rule without exception, anyone who has been mayor or correjidor
in the provinces of the Philippines may be complaining, because nothing is said in particular against
mayors or correjidores good, there have been, and will there are very good and industrious;
but also on the contrary, and there was terrible, because men are not always ones, and such
as they should be for himself and his fellow: but let this matter, that already been treated and
has returned to play here, because mayors and correjidores collected and given part of the national
treasury, and move on to dealing with employees, contributions and
rents.

Here is precisely where it is essential to relieve the author of this report, such as begging, any
indulgence for protesting as his mood does not hurt in the slightest the character, views and
opinions of any particular employee, for his plan only reduces to express the momentum that
rents could be, and indicate that with the gradual increase employees who have those offices
here twenty years if it continues, very soon not be sufficient revenues to meet Treasury salaries,
pensions, retirements and other charges that is overloaded with this
purse, and impoverished as well as the country, and it is necessary
time to deal with this damage and cut so as not to expose himself
undergoes the dire consequences I could bring, and that few will stop
to see them.

§. III.

EMPLOYEES.

Taking the trouble to compare the payrolls that existed in the Philippines in 1820 with those that
exist today, of course it will have doubled or perhaps tripled, but so is more Espedito and current course
of business, so the number of employees should be reduced to the
purely accurate and necessary, and that hotbed of course cease of
them, which under the dictation of pensioners with three hundred pesos
a year, have sent there to await placement even to many who should
be learning ..... what they mind knowing, but not so imajinarios obtar
jobs to the issuing of its placement for those countries, which have
burdened the public treasury, not be useful in a long time those who
come to exploit.

Add to this that after a job cow is provided in the Peninsula, the
most often without attention to scale, merits and services, and any
known disgust that this must cause, and how badly served are jobs
until the time EXPERIENCE and teach new graceful as when there were
ignored.

Could cite examples, but this would be my intention to leave and
hurt people in any way belittle my soul is nothing of his character
and concept.

I agree it is a prerogative of the supreme government provision of jobs, but the of pure grace, such
as heads, but this government, that the epithet of just that gives you to be real and effective,
it seems that sometimes, if not all, the scale should consult employees, although the services
of each one, and that its greatest merit, ability, knowledge and higher category is the rise,
pass, only means of entering the noble emulation among employees of all kinds, the administration
is conferred to the more deserving in every respect, and revenues were well managed and directed,
and obtained building that are susceptible and in the Philippines until the day it can be
said that estate is in its infancy, or is something up by nascent and ancient routines and
is modified only by the greatest number of hands that now occupies.

On the other hand, the abundance of workers as unnecessary and which taxes to the Treasury, are
other damages of no less consideration: such are the cluster of unoccupied
jente so little conducive to the public tranquility, that always exist
in all offices escedentes, aggregates and supernumeraries for a vacancy
occurs, there are a hundred to whom place of effective with obvious
prejudice to the scale and the worthy sons of the Spanish, who are
also creditors to attend them according to their ability and merit,
and history of their parents, demand policy principles of public convenience
and rigorous justice, and finally in this part is to say that if the
administration of public finances has to be good order to be observed
and the potential savings, much more in the present times shortages
and hardship for the busy-state, neither will be achieved by increasing
employees every day, always unnecessary, and having an excess number
of aggregates, which upon affect the scale of numbers, amounts of
body absorbs annually for salaries they enjoy.

Another reform in this part and not least is that pensions are not granted some in the Peninsula,
payable from the funds of the Philippines, and to withdraw granted: something there are already ahead on
this, but not everything should be. In good time for the viudedades, retirement and pensions
of those who have served and died in the Philippines are paid as fair for their boxes, but
these people, if they come to Spain, in justice should come with them pensions, with the corresponding
low value difference of the currency. This I seems a trifle, is the first step in establishing the
economies to be made at that Exchequer savings claimed by the circumstances, which of them
will be cut old introduced in this part of abuse.

The decrease of employees to the purely accurate and necessary, is another cardinal basis economic
reforms and, if considered at their true worth the sacrifices that people make they contribute
with their sweat to pay the charges state, because these terms reduce possible, is to relieve the
burdens of the people, and enrich the nation.

§. IV.

CONTRIBUTIONS.

The tax or personal contribution of the Indians, though very moderate, can not be increased
in any direction without exposing the government to great evils, because, being infinite number
of poor Indians, or who earn only their livelihood, to this part
of whom would be large aflijiria a surcharge of contribution: later,
and when he has given some impetus and promotion to the class of owners,
and when the property is found distributed in many hands, it advisable
to increase the tax you pay now with a lot of inequality in respect
of the trade of laborers and artisans.

The payment of this contribution is usually made in kind and in cash, or both, and this brings harm
and severity of consideration, so the quantity and quality of what is received, such as costs
and damage to transportation and storage. A retributive account finance offices in Manila on
this Jenera of operations, has indicated reliable results the Government to make a determination
at this point, but anyway must proceed from the principle that when government employees perform
such Jenera traffics in free trade, he always loses because their agents are bad administrators,
who lack the calculation and knowledge of market prices and other
attending circumstances and always attend private traders in business
own.

Well not be denied that the mayors in their provinces as Barangay heads in the people responsible
for immediately collecting tribute from the Indians, have influenced
some thing in the need to switch the payment of tribute money to sort,
to some and others better their business, but in my opinion this is
not only the cause that has introduced such a system collection detrimental
to all, because the Indian is not so dumb or innocent ceases sell
their agricultural production to whom the pay is greater than the
price Tariff, under which he received in kind by the heads and mayors.

The cause principal has become almost necessary and indispensable
this switching, and that directly work course to the detriment of
the Indian, and some against the public treasury, is the lack of a
coin only peculiar colonial Philippines, as do all other European
possessions of the Asia, whose need, as well as the benefits of all
sorts that would bring, will be discussed in separate paragraph, according
deserve.

This vivificaria domestic trade, would facilitate the payment levied,
and would encourage other indirect contributions established.

Indirect contributions by stagnant incomes in the Philippines, are most analogous to the nature
of some people, who generously provided fertile ground for his all necessary means to their
food, become objects of primary necessity superfluous joys to life. It must, therefore, a constant
maximum promote good governance and administration to rectify the of these indirect contributions,
especially that of snuff and wine, not only because they by itself
sufficient to thoroughly cover all the burdens of state in all areas,
but because in the case of a war and total lack of trade, will the
Government is firm support of its existence, and not to give ear to
the month featured and proposals of those who in good or bad faith,
or at least ignorance, working for free from stagnation to the Islands.

Ultimately,

it is noted that these contributions are not interim jeneralicen by all Archipelago provinces
subject to the Spanish rule, so as to extinguish the focus the large contraband always resides
in the provinces exempt, and to adopt reforms necessary for better administration and development,
products in the Exchequer must be quite disproportionate to the consumption of large population
of the islands, as can be inferred and known by what they say then trying to snuff on the income
of Philippines.

§. V.

INCOME OF SNUFF.

The income that keeps the islands, which can not be subrogated to another, and that well-established
and administered and yields would produce incalculable benefits, the income of the snuff. Three million
and a half, all without exception of sex or age of snuff consumers, and each of which matched
the classes and a very low calculation can be adjusted Strong consumer four dollars a year
per person, would produce a tax of fourteen millions of dollars, that out of the land and the
arts to give the same time a great trade promotion. This calculation is not a paradox, is a practical
reality and truth, for snuff use is as a first necessity for the Indians, who may object to this
form the same calculation would be formed on the consumption of bread in Spain, or on another
article of greatest need, if any.

The snuff of the Philippines for their quality, and according to the
taste and national consumer opinion and strangers, took the first
place, after Havana, among all classes of tobacco grown in Asia and
America, and the price advantage that constantly keeps Manila snuff
markets in India, China, Batavia, Marianas Islands, Cape of Good Hope
and other points over all other sources, justifies this concept, as
well as the swollen rights that most of these arrangements have been
recharged.

So also for quality offered special that plant, a vast and important article of commerce. However,
state the reasons which prevent nswers get the benefits as tight and as branch branch of commerce.

The
establishment of this income in some provinces of the islands and not others, especially in overseas,
on the island of Luzon, three kinds of causes serious damage. 1st Failure in the treasury of the contribution
of the tobacco-free villages, whose privilege also maintains unequal and unjust condition among
subjects from the same government. 2D The lack of consumption in the provinces of the tobacco
smuggling causes abundant free provinces are in favor of the easy transportation by sea and
the extent of the costs not populated on the island of Luzon, which favors both landings. And
3rd Increased costs in much fruitless in the protection of the sea
makes the rent.

This damage is so obvious being on the day subject to tight a little less than half of that
population in the Philippines income produces only fourth or fifth of what a reasonable estimate
was to produce.
