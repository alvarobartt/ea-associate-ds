 You
come to me ... me I have not ever needed to know what books I know. They do not want follow my
advice, sir! The books are useless in the new towns like ours. Rozas to overthrow the books were
not required, to make the 1853 Constitution, were not necessary and is the best constitution
in the world. I am a lawyer and I have enough Darnasca to learn my profession. The notion of right
is lost as is further want to know the texts. The same policy! We are not prepared to govern
Hamilton, Madison and Story. Good sense, that's enough! Yes, gentlemen, good sense enough! I, for
example, but do not read newspapers, and journalism, gentlemen, is like the pelican feeds their
children with their own blood. Have you ever been in my studio, Don Ramón, is not it? Have you been?
Well! What books have you seen? Collections of newspapers that I have written, yes: the collection
of the Beehive, The Sword of Damocles, Regeneration Porteña The liberty cap, etc., All the
papers that I have been editor. "Well, eh? ... I needed some time fishing out about the penguins
on the Patagonian coast when I was minister, what have I done? ... Sword of Damocles to ...
record collection In 1853 or 54, I find the article I wrote about fishing for these molluscs
...

- But, doctor, do the penguins are not birds? - Observed my uncle.

-
But do not fly, Don Ramon, and are essentially maritime and fishing
rather than hunted; why is that classed among the molluscs, and thus
I designate in my article of the Sword of Damocles.

And as I say fishing for the penguins, say parliamentary government; we are talking about the benefits
of the bicameral system ... You see the result has given us in the nation and the province ...
We have gone back, gentlemen, we have regressed twenty years, our first act of government should
be back to the camera only and not numerous.
