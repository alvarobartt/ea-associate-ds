 Operations troops
of the Viceroyalty of Buenos Aires will give us chances of finding other specimens of this
nature, which has been miraculous check the pacification of these kingdoms, and the mighty hand
of God Almighty wanted to keep under the soft domain of our August Monarch, D. Carlos III, Christians,
the just, the magnanimous and most gracious of Sovereign.

Lost that day the rebels as they had in their camp, they took many mules horses, cattle of all
kinds, furniture, effects, and in particular the food, which had stockpiled for some months: fled
scattered everywhere who escaped from the action, and the army of King, the day he went to the
village of Azangaro, capital of the province this name, which also was empty like the others,
and only found it to Lieutenant the priest, who informed the General had been obliged to consume
the consecrated, profane fearing the rebels, because they had tried many times to take his
life and steal the jewels of the church. Was sent to camp half a league, to take center Paruro
columns and Cotabamba, who had come to that neighborhood two days earlier, and Soon to be learned
from a prisoner who Cristoval Diego Tupac Amaru and his nephews retired with the troops that followed
them, turned away from the town of Puno, after having fought four consecutive days, and that
all the night before and that day, had passed close Paruro column, which was far only the body
of the army as a league. Immediately sent to the Commanding General was informed of the regiment
of Colonel cavalry of Cuzco, Rocafuerte Marquez, who a short time he returned with D. Isidro
Guiasola, his second in command, who commanded since the first one was hurt, D. Manuel of
Castile, and both of them certified to be true because the prisoner had said.

Guisasola reprimanded by the general of his negligence in not having
been part of a new so weighty, apologized to different excuses inconsequential,
which gave enough credit to arrest him and put him in martial, as
rightly deserved, for there was doubt reason, that the tyrant and
his nephews Cristoval Diego achieved the leak, which would still have
surely if the commander and his troops had been completed column monitoring
and activities that were necessary at times so critical.

Do not let it be practiced by some errands for his capture, because they learned news also
for answer, that those rebels had stayed that night at the ranch of one of his confidants, was
far only league and a half from the camp. Left on his follow up 11-1/2 at night Col. dragons,
D. Gabriel de Aviles, a detachment of 200 men, but were useless their errands, and had stayed back
confirming the main rebel in the same place indicated, and that without doubt would have been
arrested if he had pursued the column of Paruro as it should.

At dawn on the day immediately, started the Commanding General, taking the path of Putina, with the
intent to make every effort to meet the chiefs of the rebellion, but That same afternoon he
learned from a prisoner, who followed another direction, and having also varied the next day,
failed to be certified else was useless to follow them, because they retired rapidly to the province
of Carabaya, nearly abandoned all his, and that poorly were followed by 100 persons of both sexes,
but still showing, would not submit to continue rebellion with commitment
and consistency, told the villagers along which, columns were about
to get some lions, tigers and other wild beasts that devour the army
Spanish, getting to these barbaric fantasies, the fools of those unhappy
I believe unfortunate countries and lend a blind obedience.

It also heard the same time, several prisoners who were uniform answer to the General Relations,
the Indians of the provinces of Chucuito Omasuyos and Pacajes, still the site of town of Puno,
and that had reduced to such terms, which was close to surrender.

With this news it was decided, that a detachment of 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 Indians Anta assistants,
in charge of the Army General Staff, D. Francisco Cuellar, to receive up to double shifts
for Carabaya province, not only in order to pursue and seek to arrest the traitors, rather than avail
himself of the Andes, but also for to punish those infamous provinces, which have been among
those who have hated, most stubborn enemies of the Spanish name. Paruro provinces and Chumbivilcas,
continued still in their riots. A highlighted contain D. Manuel Castilla, mayor of the First,
and D. Francisco Laizequilla, chief justice of the second, so that they went without waste
of time to pacify the troops themselves, who served in the military: and Major General with
the rest of his determined aim to Puno with the aim of freeing that
town of conflicts in which they were, and to acquire secure state
news City of Peace, Ponds and other provinces of the Sierra, whose
fate ignored entirely, to have the rebels closed the steps and have
intercepted all communication with them.

Having started with this endeavor Ocalla field that night, in which the proximity Father was found
dead Fray Jose Acuna, religious Order of Santo Domingo, conventual Cuzco, and manager of the
estates that have this religion in those territories. The next day the army continued the march,
and the half hour was seen from a plain dilated the high mountain of Puquina Cancari, almost all
of stone, and so steep that not rise more than a trail so narrow and difficult. As they approached
the van, dragon soldier, who was once the general, warned in a ravine, located front, recognized
as two or three Indians, but some residents believe that would be valley, ignoring the leniency
with which they were treated, had participated in that rough, fear of deserved punishment, he ordered
them not to harm or annoy anyone, and went on to a ayllo, which was about a quarter of a mile:
whose neighbors who would as about 80 of both sexes, went out to meet troops of the King, and kneeled
down in front General, with many tears they asked pardon their crimes.

Condescended to his pleas, and commanding them to present all the sacks of potatoes which he has
to supply the army, I was very little bread, giving it the would be paid in good faith, to
their fair prices in their own presence. At this time, D. José Maria Acuña, commander of the
column Cotabamba, arrived at full gallop to give notice to the General, who had been obliged to
halt the rear, near the mountain where he had just spend the rest of the army, because the
Indians that were in it, had had the audacity to toss and precipitate gauges to the troops, however
their number did not exceed 100 persons of both sexes.

With this notice was for 80 rifle, to punish this daring, indeed unexpected, the sight of the whole
army, and ordered to suspend the march, fell the same General cavalry regiment of Cuzco, to surround
the hill on his lap, and prevent none of those daring escape rebels. But they were far from
being intimidated with immediacy of the troops who were heading to the attack, remained obstinate,
without thinking rather than to die or to defend the post, which dealt with the utmost boldness
and audacity, favored stones both very high, which put them to shed, ignoring offers of forgiveness,
them to an officer Cotabamba troops, whom responded with fury, that before wanted to die than
to be pardoned. Inflamed this barbaric troops resolution, attacked with the greatest ardor, and they
were giving to the crest of the hill, where is it any longer was impossible to escape from the
hands of his opponents, many a desperate party elected of the falling down, plunging from a height
of more than 200 yards to shatter before to surrender, and the remaining asylum sought by the concave
of the rocks, where they made recent efforts to defend, without taking
the least notice of the repeated voices our soldiers shouted, offering
forgiveness again, sorry for the situation where they were.

But nothing was enough to diminish that ferocity, and it was necessary to some of us with evident
danger of their lives looking for, to get them out of deep caves in which they had been, where
they were left to rip, rather than surrender: and there was a rebel, who won the third of the rifle
to the soldier who was chasing him, he struggled boldly with intent to cast him down headlong,
and they have been achieved by the rugged terrain, if not a colleague speedy help. Thus continued
the defense until they died all who had the temerity to undertake it, which fact will be very doubtful,
to those by distance or by the wrong concept that had been so far the Indians of Peru, can not make
a sound mind that despised value their lives, to sustain terrible sedition.

It was already approaching the army near the town of Puno, and for news positive of his situation,
determined the Commanding General to dispatch a self D. Joaquin Antonio de Orellana, who commanded
in it, among other precautions, "said he, going to all diligently to help him with powerful forces,
and to advance the state news that was the town of Juliaca. But then the march got in, and found
no the response was not until night, when he was already camped six leagues from distance, where
he became an officer of the garrison of that town, with your response commander, in which she
participated by 12,000 sites still be Indians, who followed the Tupac-Catari flags, those who
fought with more tenacity, and that his troops were tired by the repeated assaults they had
suffered and declined. Moment he had feared perish with all his soldiers and neighbors at the hands
of the besiegers, as they had made efforts to render them by force or by famine, but had gained new
strength, and had the most comfort with the news of the proximity of the troops of King, manifesting
from after the demonstration to give due thanks to the Almighty, for a happiness that not expected,
he told the rebels with a peal of bells and repeated bursts of the artillery and light fittings.
But these, far from feeling the accident, taxes novel by an Indian deserter, had done the same
demonstrations of joy, with their boxes, speakers and repeated revelry, shouting to the besieged,
that the king's army had just arrive, and leave mandated by the Inspector
General of the kingdoms, D. José Antonio Areche, was in his favor
to punish them for the many Indians who had died, and then would verify
Joseph Gabriel Tupac-Amaru had acted under orders of his Majesty,
whose expressions were only the effect of political cunning that the
caudillo Tupac-Catari and their captains had seduced and deceived.

General made the mood to spend that night two miles from Puno, submitted to before their eyes
the next day very early, and having enough time for the operation that you agreed to practice,
and take steps as may be necessary, but at two in the Later he had notice that the rebels had
again assaulted with intent to pass the sword all his defenders, before it received the relief
they expected. Aceleróse progress and At 4 pm they found the army in front of the villa, and
saw the ground General As he had been informed. With the presence of troops stopped the enemy
King action when, retiring to a mountain once, quite high, and the army camp on his lap for being
late, and be very weary soldiers of the march, with resolution to attack the next morning, to which
end she was warned to Orellana, who at the time observations began the attack, would make a departure
to the garrison, to cut off their retreat. When they were taking all measures to verify, came
to camp on Orellana magistrate, accompanied by many officers, and joyfully reported that the
rebels had forsaken his situation that night, and was admitted, it had divided into several
pieces, each following a different direction.

Expressed with the greatest demonstrations of joy thanks, and said it would have retired and
left the village, if the mayor of Arequipa, Baltasar Semanat, I would given the help that he
had been asked to do so without the risk of being intercepted. It also shows the priest D. Casimiro
Rios, a native of Puno, who was imprisoned by the Rebels on the road to Arequipa, drawing his escape
the precipitation with which the rebels had retired. This said, who commanded the army of
the rebels an Indian named Andrea Guara, as Catari general, who to persuade his subjects that
his escape did not result the presence of Spanish troops, led them
to believe the field by be lifted very sick leave to heal his homeland.

In this way the constant freed overlooked defenders of the town of Puno, which therefore time
site had been a stubborn, refusing to attack the rebels from both parties; that is, those harassed
by the Chucuito, which followed the Apas Julian, surnamed Tupac-Catari, under the title of
Viceroy of Tupac-Amaru, and the other of the efforts of Indians in the provinces of Azangaro,
Lampa and Carabaya, which under the orders of different warlords, and even those of Tupac-Amaru
Cristoval Diego, sought with dogged bad record held that town and sacrifice to their fury the
lives of its inhabitants, whose commitment to I encouraged the consideration, that this barrier
removed, is entirely at your disposal dilated those domains, and in them was no longer the King
another city that of Peace, which also saw in his hands, provided they could meet the strength
and espugnacion devote his hard, as they had already begun: graduating this company the only
one they needed to strengthen its tyrannical dominance in every province of the Sierra, as we shall
see later, because now it is necessary to go back some steps to take Since its inception the
site of Puno, and the reasons that forced his Corregidor, D. Antonio
Orellana, to form the project of resisting the rebels in that small
space: resolution moves that just deserves to posterity, in order
that the constancy, loyalty and spirit of the vassal, and others who
accompanied him, as stimuli to imitate an action that is all the more
admirable, as it were not satisfied even the slightest knowledge or
principles art of war.

Reported the atrocity committed by José Gabriel Tupac-Amaru with its mayor, D. Antonio Arriaga,
the provinces and Chumbilvicas Cailloma course had given him obedience, and trying to seize
the other, that of Lampa, D. Vicente Ore, eager to drown in principle the violent fire of rebellion
which began to be experienced as more close to that of ink, issued the corresponding call
on magistrates of Azangaro, Carabaya, Puno, Chucuito, Arequipa and La Paz, for one to help with the
attempt to all the efforts that were possible, and to dispel the ideas of rebellion. Together,
thus the forces in the capital of Lampa, and appointed commander
of all D. Francisco Davila officer who had been a Marine, was discussed
that D. Antonio de Orellana march with his men the people of Ayabirí
to reinforce that important since it is reputed as a border: but at
the two-day retreat was ordered, along with 100 men but which led
his orders, as indeed verified, restoring again to Lampa.

At the same time escaped the same Order to Colonel Azangaro militia, and Lieutenant Colonel Lampa
those that occupied him with some troops from their respective provinces, but these represented, giving
some considerations to support his opinion remain in it. Notwithstanding the foregoing by those officers,
realizing that it was absolutely forces necessary to collect a point to act in concert, and
with free of them, they repeated the orders that without loss of time practicing than previously
had ordered them but when they received was so near the enemy, who could not check withdrawal without
confusion, many falling into the hands of the rebel, and juntándosele others either with the
vile idea of ??following his infamous flag, or to ensure their maximum, trusting in the offers that
had published.

This event shocked no little courage, and determined to put together a council of war, resolve what
was to egecutar, considering the situation in which they were, and benefits collected by the rebel
Sangarara and other places, and he had also fallen in Ayabirí hands, the greater part of gunpowder
and bullets that had been stockpiled for defense. The Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel of the
regiment of militia cavalry did Lampa also present on this occasion, that its militants were also
suspected by the effect had caused in their hearts the artificial lure of the promises of the usurper;
and met all these circumstances, it was the party to withdraw the people of Cavanillas what is
not practiced, owing to the aforementioned militias would not meet, either espressi the grounds, or
because, possessed of fear, obey disgusted that provision, and implemented
only those Chucuito Paucarcolla and led by their mayors, Orellana
and Moya, who came to Lampa, Carabaya Azangaro and the people above,
from where they came from the last three for the city of Arequipa,
requesting the help that Ore had asked beforehand, and the first two
returned to their respective provinces militia troops with them, where
they remained some time with the resolution to defend: but knowing
that Tupac Amaru was the capital of Lampa, suspicious of the Chucuito
movement of its provinces, which were already very restless, retired
to Arequipa, and even Orellana.

Harassed by the cries of neighbors who wanted to save their lives and property, was compelled to
seek a safe haven, to 12 miles away from that town, and wait with less shock that I had requested relief,
accompanied only by the few who were fully determined to continue, hereby removing the occasion
those provinces that may attempt to redeem their interests pardon suspicious, with the attempt
to arrest him, for delivery after the leader of the rebellion as requested.

Verified its determination on December 11, 1780, after being released by the way, Joseph Gabriel
Lampa had gone through, and that his army was heading to long hours towards Puno. Command before
carrying it out, bring all neighbors who stayed, and encouraging their expressions as he could,
he hastily called it bore the highest fidelity to our rightful Sovereign, and to guard against
sedition and deceptions of the tyrant, and they left secured the few weapons they had, so it does
not take possession of them the enemy, left without waste of time towards the Sierra, where it remained
until acquired news, that after of many ravages and outrages committed in the Province of
Lampa, and left secretly order to their own provinces, to burn it and surrender it, had fallen
unexpectedly to the provinces of the viceroyalty of Lima, with the troops that followed him,
thinking they would be and such other serious reasons, that slowed the relief they had asked
the magistrates Peace and Arequipa, and to restore the obedience due the nine provinces had embraced
the infamous party rebel, determined to pass in person to Arequipa, to overheating instances, to
ensure that aid as he had requested.
