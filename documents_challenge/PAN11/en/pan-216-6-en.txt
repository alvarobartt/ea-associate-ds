 In 1837 was provided in another particular lawyer. The Audit of War Marine
and also was served a few years by another magistrate, and although in 1830 the auditor was war
appointed by the King, and took charge of his office, not the Marines who, but suffer mistake, even
today plays the same magistrate. It should be noted that these destinations assignments have
decent, and have great emoluments by reason of fees, and one and others, the salaries of ministers,
have enjoyed these at once, when they have served these jobs. The court of dead and missing
property, an institution that should be preserved and give her best, as we shall tell you
the reasons be expressed in a separate paragraph is another position that turns among the magistrates
of every two years [4], and this court is matters of importance, but that is a lot or a little
bump your organization, it is certain that There are far behind him, and that their course
is in the extreme slow, do not observe the law signal is sent every week day to see these fights
[5]. A former top joint Real Estate (discontinued now) attended as member of the regent of
the hearing, and failing the senior judge or minister oldest: the infinite expedients that knew,
and whom he output was to give a preference, occupying more than you can say, and much more,
since in this kind of business is accustomed always leave with more caution and care, the immediate
financial liability they caused, and the particular circumstances of being the only lawyer who
was involved in their decisions the minister of the audience, convince certainty to any of the
above, and that obviously went into them warily. Currently, the top joint finance litigation is
composed by three ministers, under General-president of the local deputy superintendent Finance
[6], and its business, but as many as the top joint of the former do not give in to gravity. The
hall call justice, which is the second known instance of the court appealed more cars and
audience of the day, also up three ministers, and in view of fiscal of civil, it's become,
hear and rule on such cars, which expedients, processes or causes, for some three names to fit
you, yours are bulky and complicated by nature and lots of points to embrace, and are therefore
subject to occupation and severity; and though not much, also distract and occupy the same business
when still in progress are room visits or calls from PC board that comprises Mr. regent or oldest minister
in a civil attorney, where as for advice, referral for consultation counter greater when you like.
A board of auctions also attend the ministers and civil attorney, who is also heavy and irksome
occupation. Finally, a lord judge rotated annually in the office of judge of sororities and
fraternities, and another is an advisor to cross what is the oldest generals, who with the tax commissioner
and civil, comprising the court of the bull, and I have some gratification but small. Another is director
of the Monte Pio, another guard, another judge of slavery and freedom, another judge of hospitals
and nursing homes rides and married expulsion to Spain [7] being separated from their women:
law fall obsolete as many good laws, another is a judge of protocols and lower courts, and in all
these units is occupation, as no shortage of issues and different business and by necessity all
the progress must be slow and even late, and they that are themselves or any serious complication.

The prosecutors, in addition to the duties of his vast tequios ministry, which are very large
and complicated (as it is common for any fiscal proberbio resists that office five years fulfilling
as it should), they call upon themselves the protection of Indians
and Chinese, reduced nothing less than to make themselves (and privileges
that those are) the defense of their people, and business even when
run over by a person believe that they have not been to do justice,
benefiting (and make it easily) to the tax shelters, and occupy, and
not a little at times, for nothing but detract from their important
work to the gentlemen of the prosecution when they seems no reason,
and right when you are.

Now if for a single room of a regent, five ministers and two prosecutors are also of their regular
duties so many charges and fees of such gravity and occupation as well is, how it is conceivable
that speedy justice is administered in any field? It is impossible whatever may be desired in this
particular interim is not removed with a strong hand all these barriers, rather each one alone
to hinder and delay, which can not subject to calculation, the progress of judicial affairs.

For
although there are more, not less serious, because this is a natural
obstacle, although it could removed somewhere, never will be entirely,
at least in many years.

More than half provinces are overseas, compared with the capital Manila, located on the island
of Luzon or New Castile, in many of these trips are subject to Monzon, that is, while specific
station or to come and return to their ports, and although the establishment of postal raised
throughout the Islands as set forth in 1837, to affect anything, it will be little or nothing,
because the islands do not take interim flight required to have vapor prosperity crossing
in the archipelago [8], this obstacle, natural in itself, cause delays
and delay that can only remove a new plan and plant Fixed municipalities
and, that is what expresses the end of this matter.

ยง. III.

OF THE MAYOR AND CORREJIDORES.

Demonstrated the many serious obstacles to the administration of justice in the Philippines which
is so early is desirable to the higher court, or is second-and Third, it is manifest that
mediate the most serious in the lower courts, for though much different to the statements, they
are no less serious and worthy of attention the government and those,
and the Corps colejisladores consideration in his day, to seek to
remove them as soon as that can be, and given the special law for
our overseas provinces, are taken into account and what the Government
has failed to do, is refine the work, and are completely removed,
starting a new but similar progress and characteristic of the progress
of those provinces, and provide them with consummate rejeneracion
perfect for a bouquet as important as the question, and draw from
it the fruits of all and corresponds crave.

They are most unhappy in the provinces of the Philippines in the lower courts to give them speedy
justice for what they are before the hearing of the territory, because if this many serious
attention and weighing on their small number of ministers is in itself a serious cause of delay,
given the provinces to lay correjidores mayors and (most military), and all dedicated mainly to
the care and promotion of their interests through trade, and applied to raise funds, whose
collection is at his office, to them advance their fortunes, in an act of justice but do not
take part or interest, so generals, Thin offering the actions required to sign the signature,
for all proceedings generals is sorted by address by counsel, to which end the causes go, lawsuits
and processes to Manila for advice, in consequence of the provinces there are no lawyers established,
excepting those two or three that are immediate to Manila.

Criminal cases are formed first a summary is called, the mayor [9] the town where the event occurs that
motivates, instructing the first dilijencias, the more times or almost every language of the
country, not knowing the Castilian, and four taken ill statements to the defendants, if any, reports
to the mayor or correjidor. This at fault reviewed and approved interpreter, and to be imposed
on what has been written has since then the car, sending those dilijencias translated into Castilian
by an Indian either understand something of our language, and continues with the same or another
that entitles Indian interpreter summary statements that you think, and with the same ignorance
in practice trials that started the mayor. Are not these items and the most apropos eligible to begin
a case? As happens so neither more nor less so happens, unfortunately.

In the state that looks like the mayor or correjidor, provides another
order of referral of acted for a lawyer from the capital, in view
of this and advise him to dictate the procedures and dilijencias as
justice, with which business that is already forgotten, until return
performances with opinion of counsel, and sometimes tend to spend
many days and even weeks and months, only to expect a timely occasion
to refer the summary to the consultant until vessel or passenger has
to carry, and this is already on the delay that is unsafe; more often
be witness to all in court.

As the summary forms usually with many defects, court leave and return to Manila, and thence to
the province several times, until the assessor, the mayor or correjidor mayor and understand
each other, usually with great difficulty and labor, and always with the consequent delay in
proportion to the distance of the province. Meanwhile many essential dilijencias lost or become irreparable
and useless for the delay, and as in the investigation of criminal acts that no progress in the
first dilijencias, rarely come on later, is very rare to see a summary inquest well-educated.

Finally declared, after due difficulties, enough to proceed, courts promoters are not prosecutors
or defense counsel are able to ask the cause each according to his ministry, and to every motion
that inmates or prisoners often presented The Indian defense, or any other incident that occurs,
the course is suspended and then adviser when opportunity: lately, do not disturb more in
particular, where If sentence is pronounced with counsel and with the delays everything else,
and given and published, the case is sent to the hearing, where prosecutors to request usually
return to the province to reform defects, and even some annulments,
with which can not administer justice, or to practice some interesting
dilijencia was omitted, and still can be useful.

Now, the sight of this tiny little sketch and a story of how a criminal case Will there be any
doubt that it is defective and the substantiation of the heavy and slow of necessity be the administration
of justice? I think not, but if anyone doubted this indeed, can express their doubts, which
practically may be met with enumeration of cases in which I myself have been a consultant, not
a single province, but several.

There are happier and brief civil litigation, although the parties as directed by lawyers,
and well supplied with their motions (many I have done), to seek to activate, and countering
musings of litigating in bad faith, do not get it, and the reason is because they know that
ask the judge to advise and stopped the business, and cars adviser to Manila when has occasion:
then are endless litigation in the first instance, because they come and go Manila to the province
several times, and many of them to issue a not, that knew very well it promoted what would happen
so, but in the meantime annoy his hand, and if in possession of the thing Litiji, enjoys it
and enjoy, and which has blessed: incalculable damages that are caused, as well as being so palpable
that the delay and large extravagance for those who demand justice,
and the facility to hinder the who want to retain the alien, because
it will promote the natural obstacles, as said, and those derived
from the mayors and correjidores lay, these could certainly disappear
if these destinations are served by lawyers, and as regular as it
sounds, and many would stop worse, as indicated.

ยง. IV.

OF THE MAYOR AND OTHER ITEMS CONSIDERED CORREJIDORES OUTSIDE THE BRANCH OF JUSTICE.

Hitherto only mentioned these employees as dependents of the judiciary, it is necessary also
considered as heads of finance in the provinces, and say some things about it, monstrosities
that even though they appear, are only realities, because here it is referring only things
as they are, without exaggeration, or other defect or defect.

Correjidores the mayors and the Philippines, in addition to the judicial functions meet civil government
and defense of the people, that is a mockery of our political leaders and commanders generals, and collection
and administration of the tax paid by Indians, the Spendius of bulls and stamped paper, or are the
employees of the treasury function, which is to say, raise, managed and distributed, and over
whose fault will talk to the finance deal.

For our purposes in what is now dealing with, suffice it to say that the provisions in municipal
and Fixed with three counts that embrace these jobs of justice, and
civil government finance, will only be made to merchants, because
those positions do not expect other remuneration, promotion, award
or reward that the benefits he gets from his administration and trade,
and consequently their own interests and increasing their wealth of
deals only, and need the right away and conscientious performance
of their obligations principals.

Enjoy strong twenty-five dollars a month when provided by the governor of Manila, Real and fifty being
appointed [10], and pay the Treasury a modest remuneration for pardon, as there is called, you
can trade, that is, licensed to deal trade a judge, a political boss and a mayor, as such may be
called the mayors correjidores in the Philippines and the responsibilities
of their jobs.

From the moment they are appointed mayors or correjidores, buy your boat domestic trade or
cabotage, and some even to the exterior, which bear effect of early exit in the provinces to
which they are intended: certainly involved in facilitating Spendius
and collect their products from the people who govern, to provide
employment his ship, and drive shipments to Manila, and this, as mentioned,
is their main attention and his first care.

Funds for the asset jiro and engage in trade after taking office, should say the meet in Manila
to a conventional interest for the rest of his team and exit, then paid to those who collected
outside the public treasury, and with the same who follow his trade as long as they remain
in their posts.

A system Fixed municipalities and produced as monstrous and irregular, however, in its inception
some benefits to the Islands, because in the midst of the great fault
is on them of capitalists, many agricultural products and crafts of
the provinces had not been encouraged, and would not settle even if
the mayor had not speculated on them to trade.
