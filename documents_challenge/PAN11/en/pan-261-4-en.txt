 Of course, you were not, but who takes the very beast of the error? Neither
had been born then. For you see, after that Mar√≠a Adela Rule raised by about two years. What
I can tell you is that the raising cost him much distress to mother. Montes de Oca agreed to
pay two ounces of gold to dad for the rental price of Mary Rule. I suspect never served because
he is a bad payer. Hallo, therefore, strange, incomprehensible, Montes de Oca you pass an allowance Vds.
Do you not know its origin?

- I do not understand, "replied Cecilia doubtful.

- I mean, "said Leonardo, if you know the reason, reason, or whatever,
the why he spent the counter to your grandmother.

- I do not know,
or rather, since I have not ever find out.

- You know and do not
want to tell me.

I read in your eyes.

- Mal reader you then.

- I deny standing tiptoe Montes de Oca passed the counter on their
own.

- I also deny.

- Ah!

See? You know and I negabas.

- Vd. I asked that.

You asked me if I knew the origin or reason for the allowance, and
I'm still fasting.

All I know is that Montes de Oca was spent on behalf of a friend
...

- That you know.

No? Leonardo interrupted.

- In sight, said Cecilia half.

Your name.

- Ay! That is left for the curious reader.

- Say it, say, he urged the young man taking his hand.

Not want to know out of curiosity, but for something that'll tell
you later.

- Vd. known as their hands.

- Who, then?

- His father
you

- My father!

Leonardo said amazed at the revelation.

Is it possible that my father carried pertinacity ....! (He caught himself and added then:) Are you
sure?

- Surefire.

- How long have you known him?

- Ugh! Since I was little.

- How do you know?

- You saw it on the
streets. Each time he stumbled. When I least expected it overhead.
He would brave and told me many things: he was made a Mataperros,
lost, badly brought up, and was going to make me catch on the soldiers.

-
Did you know his name then?

- No, not know until much later when
I had become a woman. Me has not been his friendship with another
mommy. From Corpus to San Juan, used to talk through the window, always
me.

- What's it say?

- Not good indeed
