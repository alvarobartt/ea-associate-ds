 The location was demarkated by the two crowned ridges, and their
peaks, which left between them a gap descending from the East from the Bardales. Within this gap
lay an excellent strip of arable land, covered with hooded colossi
contradanza and the lush green velvety textures of boronales prairie.

This lush and fertile land also held the ordered rows of dried corn stalks, not yet cut down after
their full harvest.
