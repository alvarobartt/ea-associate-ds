 Sent extraordinary new Commander of the Peace, asking some Relief of people,
weapons and military equipment with which to securely hold their resolution but only got her answer,
considering that they had not yet come into his hands awaiting instructions, I could not get out
of that city, or provide other species relief that they will be assisted by the neighboring provinces,
or retire in the most convenient, if your tasks are not sufficient to maintain the province
and honor Sovereign's arms.

Then found myself Lampa immediate provinces, and Carabaya Azangaro involved in painful confusion,
the rioting, robbery and death, who committed them José commissioners Gabriel Tupac-Amaru, treating
them with unprecedented cruelty, and using whatever means they dictated his tyranny to swell
his party, not only recruiting the Indians, but also collecting livestock for their livelihoods, and
usurping the royal tribute, as your order egecutaba D. Pacoricona Blas, chief of the village
of Calapuja, to reinforce the army of the tyrant that was on the city of Cuzco. Also made sure
the other hand, these same commissioners tried to attack the town of Puno, and continue to the
espugnacion the immediate Chucuito, to seize more than 300 quintals of quicksilver, which
had in those royal coffers to promote immediate minerals. All these circumstances waving Orellana's
heart, but at the same time he stated in his determination, eager prevent such unfortunate and
extraordinary evil. Full therefore these thoughts, and love and zeal for the interests of
SM, did not hesitate to sacrifice in their service. With this plan delivered the orders to get
ready all his people, even some from other provinces, who sought safety under the cover of
his, and after the magazine found was all forces in 130 rifle, 390 spearmen on foot, and 140 cavalry,
84 armed men with swords and 80 only with sticks and slingshots, which made up the total of 824
men.

Verified these first steps, and complete the number of spears that had mandated in the same province,
and also prepared the other things that seemed essential followed the prudent conduct of joining
all those who composed the main part but militias, and to the priests and priests, whom he said
his thoughts out in search the traitors who raided the provinces and particularly the immediate
Lampa. Gave them News of weapons, ammunition and troops and militia who had at his command, representóles
the benefits and advantages that could be expected for the receipt of that province, and recovery
others, if Heaven deign to bless and prosper their healthy intentions, and concluded begging give him
their opinion, and you represent all the problems that they considered fair, to vary it if it was
accurate. All compliant and willingly acceded to his ideas and approved the determination that
they had said, offering to sacrifice their lives in the just defense of the fatherland, for
which, taking advantage of good disposition in which all were out to war, gave orders for
the march, and in spite of the discomfort station that offered rigorous water, checked out of
the town of Puno, on the day February 7, 1781, without stopping in the river floods, which opposed
short no difficulties his step the following day, between the towns of Paucarcolla Caracoto,
in which post ended to be certified was true that the Commissioner of Tupac-Amaru roamed the villages,
divided into three pieces, and that the former was located near Saman, Taraco and Pusi. Since
then decided to go catch him, and followed their march to the river of Juliaca, who commanded the
cavalry wade across, intending to attack the rebels suddenly; but suspended, for having advised
the priest of Taraco, that the Indians were passing Saman river, which was about six leagues.
This notice is addressed him with 24 riflemen and 60 lancers, but when he had already been
rushed with the news that acquired I was in Juliaca. Without pausing a second ship sent the
few soldiers who had, and at two o'clock in the morning came to end up passing that river flowing,
and was immediately in search of enemies, who favored the dark of night, had withdrawn at a
greater distance. Walking followed five leagues, because the mules could not pass and horses, and
this line reached a piece of 52 rebels at 6 am, to whom summoned him to surrender Nicolas
Sanca cruel, with title of Colonel of Tupac-Amaru, caused those riots, but they responded
with insults, calling them rebels and rebels and then rushed furious: Dare they paid, leaving
everyone dead he undertook.

Among the papers that he found, had some original proceedings and testimony, which had fought
the traitor Tupac-Amaru, led to expedite the recruitment needed, that prevented the punishment
of the pastors and other clergy who opposed his orders: and also
found a letter from a mayor, who quoted the chief justice of the province
Azangaro, as the rebel, to stay together in Chingora, Andres Ingaricona,
also commissioned to gather the Indians of the peoples of Achay, Nicasio
and Calapuja all incorporated with the said Nicolas Sanca, rushed
troops to the body of Orellana, while passing the river of Juliaca:
novelty him back immediately for the rest of his troops had found
and crossed the river, and careful of that reunion, proposed hinder
any cost.

With this design, directed his march toward the town of Lampa by Calapuja, forcing him to go
this route the cries of a woman, who represented violence suffered many in that town, by a party of
300 Indians, governed by Ingaricona. But he practiced for more steps, then could not discover, or
the situation, nor the whereabouts of the Indian rebels, and decided to spend the night in
the plains of Surp, in whose camp was able to declare it a spy, sent to punish him after with some whipping,
who confessed were located at the top of the mountain, called Catacora. Without waiting for more
news, moved off to find the enemy, and he found little time occupied the eminence, flaunting
their flags, which fluttered ceaselessly accompanying demonstration of continuous shouting and
confused, but soon abandon that position, to climb to a more eminent, which was the bulk of its
troops.

Orellana searched in vain for the climb, because there was no sidewalk or any side that allowed
the access to the top of the mountain that had bet the enemy, whose difficulty is increased
with heavy rain and hail that experienced for some time. Knew the difficulty and was maintained
with some circumspection, until it was necessary to indulge the bodies of his troops, who asked to
effectively guide them to attack. In effect, divided their musketry in half, marching in different
directions, relying on the rocks to get closer to the rebels, with less risk of throwing stones
with obstinacy with slings. The riflemen and a few soldiers armed with swords, engaged combat,
and full of fire fighting, moving hastily to greater bravery, but few not to be confused and defeated
in the eminence of the crowd that awaited them.

Let them fall Orellana in action, and went in search of others to persuade them, representing
to the laudable example of his companions were not enough efforts to pawn, and wary of a unfortunate
accident with the approach of night, he had to play the withdrawal, which took place without
further loss of two men falling down. He had five serious injuries and many other slightly, and
the same Orellana received a blow of stone, which after to have broken the lower jaw, went to
hit you in the chest. The Indians had many wounded, 30 dead, with loss of some loads of little
consideration, and yet that was not achieved greater the advantage of us this day, took the
contrary the darkness of the night to go in search of Colonel Sanca, who after having abandoned
delivered to the flames the people of Lampa, came to camp with his people to some hills eminent
that is located just ½ mile from the field of Orellana.

With this news deemed useless and dangerous to continue their efforts, and determined to go back
to the Balza Juliaca, to serve not only to the insults that are brought against the province,
but also to maintain fidelity to the Indians of that village, and to those of Caracoto, Cabana
and others, who stood, even by the King. During the march was vehement indications chief of
the infidelity of Pacoricona that followed him, whom he seized and secured lead, and, having
halted in the vicinity of Chingora, warned that the summit discovered the Indian mountains
divided into two pieces, and the one going to the Balza Juliaca, inferred that tried to seize
them to cut off the retreat. To avoid this, set in motion, eager to attract them to a meeting
if they tried object, and approached the town of Coata, where I could find the number of Balza
was needed to move his troops and making them part of tilt at the
place where it fell the Indians retreated to eminence, where the strongman
who ruled asked the reason why the chief was driving Pacoricona prisoner,
being innocent, and then summoned secure his freedom, and given the
person of Orellana, because otherwise inevitably would experience
ruin.

They paid a few who left the asylum eminence, the boldness of his master, and following the proposed
idea, continued the march to camp in the plain of Ayaguacas, where they spent the night on the
arms, the care given the immediacy of the enemy.

The chief of Caracato, driven by their loyalty, said the order he had received the Indian Colonel Sanca,
to enlist the people of his village cut those Juliaca Rafts and Suches, which are enforceable
under severe penalties on behalf of the Inca, King and Lord of Peru that Orellana suspicion
of rebellious thought was none other than allowing him cut, and attack the town of Puno and
Chucuito to pass more freely into the city Pacajes Peace-forward reason why their march to
the vicinity of Coata, field edges River. And without losing time issued orders for 25 balza
condugesen Village Capachica, and stayed a day in this position and to rest his troops, as to know
the status of weapons: exercise due diligence, because the next day an Indian in that vicinity
warned that the enemies came marching, ready for the attack; as indeed was verified, and at noon
had already come down from the mountains, and came forward with an air to rush the field occupied
by our troops. Was advantageous, because the left was resting on the mighty river of Coata,
his right covered by a lake, and the back but did not allow a narrow peninsula formed by the
waters, whose input placed 25 men on horseback for the safety of the mules and cattle were and
locked in his room.

Recognized the rebel commanders, and Sanca Ingaricona so advantageous situation, and was raised
among them the dispute over whether it should or not take the attack: resistíalo the second
against the wishes and efforts of the first, I wanted stubbornly tackled, considering the small
number who opposed him, who believed even smaller than it really was, for having ordered the
infantry to sit down to await the moment of combat: disposal who certified the enemy in his opinion,
and was persuaded that the packages that were seen were baggage charges, placed that way to
serve as backup to the impulse of stones in their slings. Concerned the deception and Ingaricona
opinion, supported by a chief of the province of Carabaya, that they had built in the act
of the dispute, resolved to attack expecting victory, seizing weapons and ammunition for referral
to Tupac Amaru. With this attempt were approaching, and when they were immediate Some proposals were
made by Lieutenant peaceful healing of Nicasio, and ecclesiastical D. Manuel Salazar, persuaded
that those who surrendered their arms, take advantage of the pardon and general pardon, which
in the name of SM had been published, but they answered boldly by an Indian, who did not need
it, much less recognized and for their Sovereign King Spain, but only to their Inca, Tupac-Amaru,
and since then began to make some movements, and at four o'clock
in the afternoon was advancing in great haste to attack.

Formed a semi-circle, which ruled Ingaricona right side, Sanca left, and center the Carabaya
chief, which ended the dispute in favor of the first: but those who came to the Sanca orders
came warm, with great reluctance in combat; effects undoubtedly of the opposition he had expressed
his captain.

They began the attack by the 25 men guarding the acaballo to step up the rear, and inlet was
placed where the cattle were mutated and of course they tried to seize, attacks and strengthen
the efforts: so, it was also necessary to bend the resistance strengthen that position with
25 other men. In this situation was almost surrounded by people Orellana, and considering it
was time to attack the contrary, was formed in battle placing the musketry in the center. The spears,
swords and sticks, broken in half to the sides, supported by the little horse that was left, and
sending to fourth conversion by right and left half, rushed at once to the Indian Ingaricona and Sanca,
which were held for some time with tenacity, fighting bravely until the SANCO gave way, after
losing some men, and began a hurried flight, thrown into a deep stream, where some drowned, and
the rest followed the retreating with the greatest disorder, to avail of the neighboring mountains.
This accident gave rise to which the rebel troops that carried him to let him in their shameful
flight, and stir over the center and right of the enemy, commanded by Ingaricona, who fought
with the greatest obstinacy, to leave gracefully had held the opinion that their chief. But
the effort required winning piece that charged impetuously, had to give the order and record
the Orellana troops, who engaged in action, how many rebels were killed opposed, to that intimidated
by the gun fire continued, went on the run.

Victory was complete, and followed the reach to the mountains and hills, which sought to rely the counter
to save their lives, but death and horror followed everywhere in the field and left over 400 dead. Tended
the zeal of Salazar licensed to exhort to the dying, persuading them that in his last agony sweet
invoke the names of Jesus and Mary, but had to complain very much for your love at the sight
of the pertinacity with which breathe out. The action lasted two hours, and got the win, was
held with repeated shouts of Long live the King, and adding the comfort, that none of us had
Preco, whose particular benefit is attributed precisely to the Queen of the Purisima Concepcion,
whose image was placed in the main banner, and in the hearts of the soldiers, who devoted and
confident, imploring his assistance to maturity, because the rebel forces amounted to 5,000
fighters, not counting a large number of women, who stubbornly followed, and they were not useless,
because stones constantly driving to men, so that not lacking in the act of combat. Some paid
with his life fiercely, by more than Commander tried to stop it, persuading his soldiers do
not use the value object so weak, but rarely can contain the anger of the military, engaged
in monitoring enemy.

It reviews the next day weapons, and found some broken and many twisted by Indians have used
the precaution of covering with a very thick and hard leather for withstand the blows of the swords
and spears, and having explored the campaign for some items, did not see any rebel in all nearby,
it was inferred that they had walked all withdrawal night, as indeed, it was learned soon after,
were in the mountains of stay of Chingora. Orellana passed the river with these stories, with
the intention of cutting to them that Juliaca had led, but found none who opposed it, rather,
the Guaca Indian village and its surroundings, chastened, or frightened by the history function,
presented humbly asking forgiveness and general pardon of their lives and finances, they were
granted, of course, without inferring any prejudice, and continuing to march to Puno, went happily
in this village, after having remained in the twelve year days, and since then repeated to the
Sovereign Empress of Heaven solemn thanks for the careful protection that deigned to dispense weapons
of SM, as it was recognized first cause of this happiness.

Resent the Indians of the advantages enjoyed by those who followed the royal flags and in continuation
of their seditious ideas, did not fail diligently to collect all the forces they were possible,
to attempt to attack the town of Puno, and removed these impediments, bring their invasions freely
to the other provinces, and reach Oruro, which had declared openly rebel. Orellana carefully watched
his movements, and certified I could not resist the enemy in the campaign, determined to defend
within the village and wait for it to the enemy.

For this achievement, sent without delay to open pits, lift trenches in the positions most needed,
abastecióse of ammunition and mouth, possible shortages in which he was, and still considered
very inferior to the efforts the rebel forces had met the Governor of Chucuito, D. Ramon Moya who had
by this time returned to his province, to act in concert, offensive and defensively. Verified
this attempt, they were still were not enough to resist enemy, and determined to call for backup
to Commander and Board of City Real Estate of Peace, but only managed a consignment of 10,000
pesos, for the relief of troops was defeated on the fly, Indians and Larecaja Omasuyos. Confirmábanse
from day to day news, that a rebel army composed of 18,000 Indians and swollen for several items of Atuncolla,
Vilque and Totorani, was already in the town of Juliaca, a distance of only nine Puno leagues,
under the command of Lieutenant General mestizo, named Maverick, Ramon Ponce, and colonels,
Pedro Andres Bargas and Ingaricona, who left shed for all Spanish blood parties, without distinction
of sex or age, for those who have encouraged of them were victims of his cruelty and rage.
In fact the day March 10, 1730, at 11 am, occurred in the immediate stage with great clamor and
Puno din of drums and bugles, alternating with bursts of musketry,
to authorize new flags waved, while stretching out the crowd went
into the mountains, that surrounded the population, so they held a
estencion three leagues.
