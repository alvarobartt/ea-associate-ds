 

And seeing that, he ordered all his people together with him that this was, he would say more
than fifty thousand men of war, and these were the neighboring towns were Messrs. to give him,
if people had that as they saw the crowd of people for Inca Yupanqui came, and as he had been of
help, lanzáronse them with all their people to help him, with people who craves leave for Inca
Yupanqui, [t] ANSI given for these neighbors. And they say that the battle had just given to Uscovilca,
and victory there by Inca Yupanqui Viracocha people that you invest, then he disappeared and
did not see it most outstanding fifty or sixty thousand men, who were those who mixed their
neighbors between people who have heard.

And making people pool their Inca Yupanqui, ordered a favorable answer before all the spoil
of battle, taking the best thing that dello paresció, to sacrifice dello Viracocha by the
favor and give him victory of his enemies, and all the rest of dispossession gave é distributed
to all nations, according to their quality and services. And that was known by the roundness and
district this city the great splendor of the Lord and knew how to gratify the services, there
in all round great satisfaction, and so they will come many chiefs and people to be I offer
all parts and have the Lord.

And while Inca Yupanqui in this way and have heard, a messenger came to him a captain his,
that this was in the custody of the city, two miles of it, trying to know his enemies what they
were doing on the board do it together, for which he sent him to say, that masters who escaped
the battle fled Uscovilca Matos to do, now you have heard, Xaquixaguana orchestras and redone in
natural and confederates with her, and that of their land I had been a lot of people and relief,
and that ansimismo arrived there were already four other Uscovilca captains Paucaray that he will
discover winters Condesuyo provinces é Andesuyo, which history has told you, that as we were
all together, they left another daily in the morning to give him
battle, and to avenge the death of his master Uscovilca.

Known by the new Inca Yupanqui, ordered three good friends and to the chiefs and gentlemen in his
court and had been service, which then together the people of war and the right to bring forth
out of the field, each with their weapons, and that included all one by one. And removed and
counted, they found the number one hundred thousand men of war, which he had gathered people for the
great reputation of Se released. And they say that the enemies who were about two hundred miles men.
And thus, Inca Yupanqui sent four squadrons that were made this her people, sending each chief
lord of the Indians who were there, were leaders of their people, and so scattered, [Name?] By
generals of the three companies to his three good friends, taking for himself the one of them,
and they provide all the necessary weapons, ordered to march his field in search of his enemies
who, as they knew they were coming out of Cuzco, turned about to return Xaquixaguana to where
he waited. And the Inca Yupanqui with his people, the day of battle, as he saw the sight of
their enemies, and break and front with them, say that again face back to see his people and
squads, which were divided and each by itself [And] say that so many people saw him at that time
had arrived to help him, which have failed, and his enemies afrontóse took them in half and
giving them everywhere that was so cruel and so fierce the battle, which began already high sun,
it would be to When ten, according to them they say, and he was known Vespers della victory by
Inca Yupanqui, where they were killed by the Inca Yupanqui more than thirty thousand men, and
Chance, who were the enemy, was no man to life, among whom were that
the natives had gone Xaquixaguana, and had made censering [31] the
hair.

And called the victory and defeated the battle, they parted to one side all of Xaquixaguana,
and everyone went in front of Inca Yupanqui, and echáronsele by land, to which the Inca Yupanqui
wanted to kill to have seen the death of their own. Inca Yupanqui it defended himself, saying he
should not kill, if the Chancas had been found, it would for being the gasket in the ground, and
they could not do anything, and they were saying ansímismo the same words and gave the same satisfaction.
And then sent Inca Yupanqui, that because were dried apricots, then they were shorn her hair
and so they themselves were shorn all, seeing the will of the Inca and seeing them to worship
in it, and brought Becausethe Inca Yupanqui and Cuzco was twirling ride. And this was done,
commanded them that they were all his people, and to live in peace, and he ordered his captains
not consenting to aquesta of Xaquixaguana they should be made no
anger or being taken, any thing, and if anything of their estates
in that they were taken spoil, then the hiciesen return.

And then ordered that all prisoners were brought before him, to whom, as there were, asked what
had been the cause, provided that, was his great power, which hiciesen battle it again? And
still there among the prisoners there were incurred the Uscovilca four captains who went to discover,
as history has told you, [Said, responded] that the cause that moved them to the board that
they did in giving battle, which was to have seen his fortune was great in the days that had
gone é land they had conquered, giving reason for the battles there and in such recuentros day
each of them had been, and that none of them had never been unfortunately but had always been victorious,
and how it had acaescido them, having to always his victory was on foot, who had wanted to give
this battle, thinking that restore loss of their Lord, and avenge his death. In reply Inca Yupanqui,
who had looked wrong, and that if they were men of understanding, which were to presume that
if they had been victory for the land that they said they had gone, they had to consider that
had been in their Lord Uscovilca chance that in such demand had winters, and as hobiesen they
saw and learned that his Lord was defeated and dead, who had presumably I was finished and
the chance, and that he did not already have them, and that they were é mirasen punished and
others hear it, that this place would be punished them and all other: and again because they
were not [to] make people, which to him were uneasy and cause them that other orchestras will be
found innocent in such cases where they lost lives, as had been very many of them [to] the
junta had done together, which at that site would be punished. And thus, he sent them to bring
before him, and that the site would do the battle, and for hobiese della memory, in the presence
of all its field should command drive many clubs which were hanged, and after seasoned [hanged]
their heads were cut and placed on top of the sticks, and their bodies were burned there and made
powders, and from the highest hills were dispersed through the air, desto hobiesen that memory.
And thus it was ordered that none dared to bury any body of the enemy that longs had died in battle,
because they were eaten by foxes and birds and worms [bones] of such views were there all the time.
All this was done usually in the way that you heard.

And it finished, he ordered Inca Yupanqui was collected all the spoil
and gold jewelry silver in the plunder that had been there, all of
which was dated, and brought in front of and seen by him, ordered
ANSI time as it was, it brought into the city of Cuzco, where the
divide and give thought to their friends.

All of which was eagerly taken to him and snapped together thus for the city of Cuzco, where,
where it was, just gave and shared the spoils to their own, giving each one his paresció that
was enough and according to the quality of person. And that made and distributed, ordered his
clothes and big wins in the city had, [and] of other provisions, ordered (so) that brought him
there was a certain amount, which parescia to him that all were enough, all of which brought
ANSI, he commanded his captains that divided among all his people, all of which was distributed.

And
these grants and others made very many more than he did to his captains, who were sent to
their land to rest, and thanked him for the favor and help they had given, and so he went all,
and Inca Yupanqui was in town with his family. É while Se flashed the these gentlemen for going
to their land, they begged him that wanted to receive me under his
protection and such mercy and its vassals, and that he wanted to take
the fringe of the state and be of Inca all of which are agradesció
Inca Yupanqui and answered them that this was his father alive and
Lord, and it was not fair that while his father lived, he would take
the fringe of the State, that if this was there, that was Becausethe
was captain of his father, and begged them both that he did, it was
the one, from there, I long as they were, they were to do his father
was and respected him and do what they command them as such he was
Lord, and they said would do so.

É the other was, that they had to him by such a friend and brother, and that each and when that
he will be shipped to beg them, which they did, and they said they had no other Lord but he was,
and as such to their vassals, they could do that was good to him and he thanked him.

And thus, the left [32], and Inca Yupanqui stayed in the city, and such gentlemen caciques
went from there do Viracocha Inca was right, and after you have done your due compliance, as
Inca Yupanqui had commanded him, told him how the winters Inca Yupanqui there for them to see
what was served that they serve him, and saw them as Inca Viracocha front of him and such a multitude
of lords and so much power, much of it rejoiced because Dell had this great need for favoresciesen
him with some much of his income to build that people there wanted to do: and told them that
they were very welcome, é arose from his seat and embraced them all and it became to sit in his
chair, and commanded them to all that longs to sit down, and commanded them to put many glasses
of chicha, and gave them to drink; and then they brought out a large amount of coca, an herb
prized that they always bring in mouth, which tell the story along
grass.

And thus divided between those gentlemen, Viracocha rose standing, [and] considering that as
your child masters those invia and they both loved him and wanted him as Lord, it was just
that he ansimismo it will encouraged, we did some prayer, by which he in turn agradescia them
what he and his son had done, and already knew and had heard that he had been up there Lord
of Cuzco, é he had gotten off to do so for reasons that moved him, and that Inca Yupanqui then
on, his son, was to be Lord in the city of Cuzco, and that to him obey and respect, such as their
Lord, and from there he Desesti logo and real fringe and put it on the head of his son Inca
Yupanqui. All of which is heard by the lords, stood up, and one by one went to him and gave him
great thanks, and showed that rescibian large grant them the fact of such waiver of such dignity
and give your son Inca Yupanqui, which they both loved é wanted by the Lord, and this fact,
it turned to sit.

Viracocha Inca and begged them, that because he wanted there in the Peñol do was build a people,
and that this had need of your help and people, he begged them who had them well to give that
assistance, to which the gentlemen replied that they had come there so that he could see what
they could do him some service, as Lord Inca Yupanqui had commanded him: and that this and any
other thing he wanted was to send ready for what to do, to tell them the time and wanted to
start the month in which [to] do its work for them to invest their principal and Indians there
that they might understand the how and hiciesen of such buildings, and he, meanwhile, give the trace
of such people, and make hiciese clay figure of such buildings, they will inviarian teachers
who knew there doing good ANSI stonework as chelate the way I wanted. And his son Viracocha
(So) was grateful to them all, and then sent out many things, as
they were deep and suitcases of cocaine, and certain pieces of fine
clothes and other things between them very valuable; all of which
were brought in front of him, and being, he mesmo there got their
hands and distributed to those men and this fact, he commanded them
to drink, and that they be provided himself distributed a certain
amount of coca.

And this fact, Viracocha Inca stood up and thanked them the will and love to him and his son
and had showed him, and said the month and time they had to send his Indians and people to build
their people, and so he, Mr. rose on foot, and was staying with him in winter, and that they had,
they made their compliance, and so he will leave of him, where we will leave, and talk of Inca Yupanqui.

These
gentlemen were coming out of where Inca Yupanqui chiefs was, and went to do Viracocha Inca
was, as history has told you, and Inca Yupanqui left alone in the city their own, after having
rested two days, they had already parescióle idleness, E had recreation taken by the exercise of
his person, and so he came out one day in the city tomorrow Cuzco, é carrying the gentlemen
who had him there, he walked all that day land around the city were, and so did another the next
day, [and] after the well have seen and watched, saw the poor distribution é art that while
there his father was they had. The third day, also went looking ansímismo, together with the
gentlemen, the site where the city of Cuzco was founded, all of which, or as dello were swamps
and maniantales, as history has told you, and the houses of the inhabitants were della é thatched
small and poorly built and no proportion of street art that people had; ANSI well as in the
present day near this city a village called Cayaucachi was At that time the houses and people that
now is the great city of Cuzco.

And Inca Yupanqui saw too badly this town of Cuzco, land ansímismo é Around the crops that were
parescióle, seeing that he had time and a great rig for the new rebuilt,
and that first house in the village hiciese nor the distribution of
land, it would be okay and to build a house in the sun, in whose house
verifications and was wearing a package in place and revere the sun
do hiciesen sacrifices because, although they have there is one who
is the Maker, whom they called Viracocha Pachayachachic, says maker
the world, and they have it made the sun and all that is raised in
heaven and earth, as we have heard; caresciendo of letters of understanding
and being blind in the know, almost many variants on this at all and
everything, which sometimes have the sun by maker, and sometimes say
that the Viracocha, and for the most part, the whole earth and every
province della, as the Devil brings you befuddled, and each party
told them they showed thousand lies and deceptions, and so they brought
them deceived and blind, and in such places do ANSI Vian will they
placed stones in place, whom they revered and worshiped.

And as I say sometimes it was the sun, and to others elsewhere said it was the moon, and to others
that it was their God and Maker, E to others it was their fire that the heat and light, that
they crave é would see the volcanoes of Arequipa [33] in other parts said it was the Lord
who had given Being the world, and was called Pachacamac, he says, Giver of being the world,
and so he's brought, as I have said, deceived and blind.
