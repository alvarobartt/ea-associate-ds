 Clara and Lazarus
seemed that they would not laugh. Silent until a monosyllable here, a gesture there, again to stimulate
the conversation again. Sometimes he would place to meditate as reconsidering what was going
to say, and he who had such a good memory, was that he had forgotten (Another coincidence!)
The admirable pieces of eloquence that had prepared. Did they speak of past, present, the future?
"Devised a plan, raised a project? It is likely None of this would be subject to those intimate
debates: their voices were not anything but express concerns thousand interior painting certain
disturbances of the spirit, ask questions intensely passionate, which replicates the passion increased,
confess secrets, whose depth grew to be confessed, take an oath, to express some doubts, the resolution
was home to a thousand doubts, ask for an explanation of mysteries, engendering endless mysteries;
explain the inexplicable, to measure the infinite, to exhaust the inexhaustible.

Sometimes these communications Ana impenetrable interrupted, saying:

- But, my dear, do not you see how it goes this embroidery? What are you thinking? -

Indeed, Clara, who was embroidering on canvas, with wool colors, a little head angel surrounded
by a garland of flowers, he had red eyes and lips yarn with black
yarn, flowers all the colors were so upset, we did not know what that
it was.

Upon hearing the comments of her friend, Clara was the color of the eyes of an angel.

Twenty to thirty days pass quickly when quotidian events in a garden, dialogues longing, unresolved
questions, questions answered and bad angels embroidered lips black. So there came a day Lazarus
began to swear by all the saints that did not allow Clara out there. He would at this point
in annoying, repeated the same thing countless times, and perhaps began to relate a dream she
had last night, which was apparent sleep was absolutely impossible that he and Clara could
separate. She became very thoughtful and said nothing in half an hour, the poor boys alternately
looked at the sky, as if the sky was written resolution of that problem.

Separated.

Clara deposited their sorrows in the bosom of his friend confided to Anne Lazarus the depths
of the night the great vertigo he felt within himself, not sleeping, because a and quickest
endless series of arguments confusing, mixed with vague images perceived vigil held him invincible
and painful. The day I give them hope, evening came to join them, the evening turned to grieve.
That fateful day approached.

When thus feared the arrival of a day we have to bring something wrong, imagination is an extraordinary
force of hatred, which embodies that day that you hate; imagination is approaching this day,
and sees in figure I do not know what monster menacing hand moves
up and eyes full of anger.

There are days when the sun does not should leave.

But the designated for the return of Clara to Madrid the sun, how cruel! left. His first Ray
took the desolation the soul of the young men, threatened with separation. It seems verifies that
when a separation of this kind, when it dissolves and destroys that unit mysterious and fundamental
of human life, the entire unit consisting of complementary of two individuals, it seems, say,
a cataclysm that was to occur in nature, but that we commonly call the elements, is blind and insensible.
A continent sinks two oceans collide the least of these mechanical causes that originate in the
center of matter, but nothing happens, nothing moves in the inert
and blind machine in the world when alter the great, the huge balance
of hearts.

That morning he felt a pain Lazarus unknown. The day progressed, the students went home Ana
and found her crying, was startled to see her mourn, returned to his home, declined to enter Clara
was the room where preparations for his trip, but was afraid to himself. The leave later saw pale
and tired eyes to mourn. Seeing that her mother was saying goodbye and grandfather, Lázaro
ran out of fear that he tried to say goodbye too. Left and walked quickly to a long time out
of town and into the road, far, far away Village. Suddenly he felt the noise gives the measure,
which was approaching. The young man stopped, retreated, the measure passed quickly. There was
the desolate orphan, his face hidden hands. Others who were with her and see her laughing.
Named Lazarus, called with a loud cry, and without realizing it after
the car ran very long distance, until exhaustion forced him to stop.

The coach was gone.

Returned to the village late at night while passing through the garden noticed that some birds
that used sleep there were diabolical uproar with his songs and his restless flutter crazy.
Hurried step will not hear that and went into his house. His mother and grandfather were very
thoughtful and melancholy, neither spoke nor spoke. He stood alone, he shut himself up and wanted
to read a book; wanted to sleep, and wanted to pull out of mind one as iron crown that inflamed
the burned and oppressed, but it was impossible. That was a radiance, which, to be visible,
would like a halo.

In his fever was lethargic, and in his slumber he thought his head
spouting flames vivid that he could not quell, and their brains boiled
as a metal melted.

CHAPTER VII

# # The inner voice.

The boy was very impressionable, nervous, ideal temperament, willing to live always imaginary.
Nobody incidents matched to forge ahead, linking them to make them live a very dramatic and very
interesting working with involuntary thought in the development of
these future actions, and always had the imagination to perspective
that great events that played the main part a single figure, he alone,
Lazarus.

This vision perpetual phenomenon of youth, he had in proportions extraordinary, his imagination
was a powerful concept, and can ensure that great power was for him an implacable enemy, a demon
tormentor.

With this character, it was easy to sprout in it all the passions expansive, and grow up to lead
to exaltation. In times like this, politics, proselytizing, the sectarian spirit engendered great
passion.

Civic heroism, dedication and the tenacity Catonian that shine in some characters of all revolutions,
venality overlapping, betrayal, cruelty and rancor bloody revenge that have been in others, from
of political passion. Lazarus had this passion itself felt the heat of patriotism, creyóse called
to be an apostle of new ideas, and with ardent faith and noble sentiment embraced them.

But these resolutions are unbreakable unmixed selfishness? Sublime selfishness, but selfishness
in the end. Lazarus had ambition. But what kind of ambition? That that is not addressed but the
moral upliftment of the individual who aspires to an award only simple,
to the simple gratitude.

But the gratitude of mankind or of a people is the thing of most value in land. Which is worth
it will have it, because a man can be ungrateful, but a people in the series history, ever. In
life it is the error, but in a hundred generations of a people, discussed each other, there
is no error, and has earned the gratitude the is no remedy, even if late.

Lazarus aspired to the glory, wanted to meet a vanity: every man has
his vanity.

The Aragon was the young man serving a great mission, to conduct a huge undertaking. What was
this mission, you do not know to fixed point. Young people like that do not like things done
because they fear reality too believe in predestination, and deceived by the brilliance of the
dream, think that the events have come to us, instead of seeking them to the events.

After retiring from Zaragoza and went to Ateca, a figure was perpetually attached to his own
future in those scenes. Fool What will you do it? A queen. Where? It will simply be the wife
of a great man. Unless maybe: the wife of a dark man ... He concluded by achieving the objective
of all chimeras to a peaceful retirement, to a happy marriage.

But it was necessary to meditate, draw a plan, see the easiest way to join it.

Clara was an orphan, the poor. Here are two setbacks that have occurred since the beginning.
Ah! But he would work; be active, witty, clever. He knew he had talent. But should be a simple
farmer? No, that was enough for him. Should go to Madrid, to be heard, search a name, a job.
This would be something very easy for anyone who had such skills. Was not sure Lazarus when arriving
at court, center, then as now, the intellectual activity country,
acquire name, position, fortune?

No doubt. Hearsay and should know their Zaragoza speeches. At that time the youth made their
way easily between the crowd decrepit, who with all the vigor of the faith and the full force of
the age first undertook the spread of new ideas, inevitably imposed, acquiring a high and
enviable social position. The higher thought, why deny it? In Depth of conscience was a voice
constantly saying, "I'm worth. It is necessary to find events before they come to fetch us.
Therefore encourage. "

These thoughts were occupying the minds of Lazarus in the days that followed the Clara game. When
his determination became final, he saw that his intelligence enthusiastically became more effective
and more boldness chest. It seemed that his voice was capable of delivering the most deep, the
warmest, most genuine accents in defense of the noble principles of the time, it seemed that
nothing like its ease of expression, his terrible logic, his colorful
and expressive phrase.

In the most quiet of the night, when in lonely places was delivered to his meditations, was
heard was heard. An eloquent voice resonated within him, and silent and concentrated to the wonderful
and attended events of its own internal genius. Audience was himself, and he felt that he
had never had the human word phrases most beautiful, logical, safer, stronger intonation.
Be applauded, it seemed that around his infinite number of shades
agglomerate also applauded him, that sounded intense Clap, whose roar
filled the whole earth.

Back at his house was asleep, and during the dream continued to resonate in your brain the
same voice did shake thousands of hearts, that had the enthusiasm
or terror armies whole people, and then he imagined that within himself
there was a mysterious sound body, a loquacious spirit, constantly
holding back in his deep core the most brilliant and vigorous peroration.

Lazarus

was the genius of eloquence. He knew: he was sure of it. Every day passed without a large audience
listened to him, he thought they were lost in the void and desert
silence those voices that was admirable in itself.

There was no time to lose.

He said his grandfather was going to Madrid. The poor old man began to mourn, and said between
sobs and slobber that this resolution was very serious and suited meditate.

- What are you going to do there? - Said later, wanting to appear bothered: You have a point so
bad! ...

Ateca was then in a Don Gil Carrascosa (the same character, whom we saw play with a barber in the
first chapter of this story), which was friendly with Coletilla. The grandfather consulted the
ex-Abbe resolution of Lazarus, and he felt that it should write Uncle. The old man took the pen
and hand hesitantly drew this letter, which was realistic few days later.

Dear and respected sir, Lazarillo, my grandson and nephew of your grace, to go to Madrid. He has been
head that can make a fortune there, says it can not be in town. And indeed, my dear sir, this
is bad. The crop this year gives us neither the seed and the poor guy has more fans to the
books that the plow. I will tell your worship, respectable Sir, that Lazarus is a very clever
boy, knows many memory books and has read four times of the cross to the date a volume called
him the great men of Plutarch, which has assured me not be a matter of heresy, for if it were
not there to read in my life. Understands laws, and sometimes gets to write and fill a few books of great
stuff, although I I do not understand. It is a good Christian and very respectful and courteous to
everyone. Do not hide defects, respectable gentleman, and through what you want, tell your worship
what is their major flaw, to see if his talent and great wisdom can be corrected. This is
the case which can hardly do anything good in court, because it has very bad handwriting and
did not look what you know. I am sorry to reveal this weakness of yours, but first and foremost is
my conscience and all the gold in the world does not hide its flaws. I, however, that a good
teacher as there are in the Court, may be corrected, if applicable. This will, in time, to
be able to play a real place two thousand clerks in some, as my lord
grandfather, rest in peace.

I wish to make fortune, because I love him with all my heart; and
so, I want your worship, with his great wisdom and universal wisdom,
I report if it is possible get something out of this guy, saying at
the same time if I can count on your protection.

Make it your grace, by God, which is the only son of his sister,
and we we are poor, we can not make you happy.

"

His respectful and reverent server.

# # FERMIN ...

After three months without Don Elijah answered. Finally said, noting that he expected a bit, which
warn if he could come or not.

A month later he wrote again calling Lazarus at his side, adding that their behavior and provisions
to make fortune depended.

Lazarus was beside himself with joy.

Wanted from the day, but the prayers of his mother and his grandfather was forced to wait two
more.

The young student knew from the traditions of the family that his uncle was a very wise man, and
had been craving that had to be a great liberal.

Did not understand that a very wise man ceases to be a great lover
of freedom.

Coletilla's letter was received in early September 1821, in which
they occur the first events we have referred. Shortly after the unfortunate
scene barbershop and military input in the house of Clara, Lazarus
took the trip to Madrid. Clara did not know before the day he was
to come.

Now we can follow naturally the course of events in this
timely story. Let Lazarus preparing to depart. His mother and his
grandfather crying fired, the mayor embraces saying that he sees in
it nothing less than a secretary of the Office, the priest gives you
two rolls maimones for the road and throws a tedious sermon. The student
goes to the galley, and money takes more wishful thinking than the
way of the Court.

CHAPTER VIII

# # Today comes.

Three days after
the adventure described in Chapter Two, was clear very early locked
in the room that served as his bedroom
