    Ms comes dressed in costume
    Brianda mid-fifteenth century, and with
    a candle in his hand.

Doña
    Brianda.
    
    Oh what a night, my God! Sometimes
    I feel hot and sometimes cold. Thunder
    and lightning and barbarous fury hail

    D. Ramon, my brother I leave at night
    so fatal and out, confident of his fortune
    with all the strong and fresh squad
    who rules and governed which feudal
    lord. What they will do is a mystery
    but must be set very seriously.
