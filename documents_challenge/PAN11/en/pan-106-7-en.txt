 

I told you I loved how Magdalene with stunning, with complete unconsciousness no basis for any real
hope. The idea of ??marriage, besides a hundred times absurd, even the innocent breath had
lent momentum to an affection that was enough himself to be, was to spread and formed a cult
with no other motive than to worship. What were the feelings of Magdalene? I never worried about
them. Rightly or wrongly, attributed indifference and impossibilities of idol, the supposed
alien to any accessions that inspired, the chimeric placed in isolation and this was sufficient
to meet the secret instinct, nevertheless, exists in the hearts of those less occupied themselves
with the need to imagine that Madeleine was invincible and did not love anyone.

I was sure that Madeleine could not feel any interest in a perhaps
surprising that had thrown in his way as a mere accident.

It was possible that the single life longing did not see no fear approaching the moment of taking
a game so seriously. But certainly - yet admitting that he was free from any serious affection,
- the will of his father, considerations rank, social position and fortune, would decide to accept an alliance
to which the Lord of Nièvre contributed, plus lots of convenience, high quality otherwise.

He felt no resentment, no anger or jealousy of the man who made me
so unhappy.

Before to embody the rule of law represented, and that of reason. So the day the Magdalena's father
introduced us to each other at my aunt telling her that I was the best friend of his daughter,
remember to shake the hand of the Lord of Nièvre honestly thought: "Well But if she loves you,
he loves you too! "
