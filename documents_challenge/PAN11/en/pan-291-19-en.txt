disabused me, informing me that the step was respectively Choelechel Indian nations that I
mentioned, but not all, as I had two paths where they came, and penetrated: one fell to the
Salinas, where salt has provided Buenos Aires with the carts, and is gone from the Indians Peguenches
and Aucases, whose leader named Guchulap, and the other farther north and not far from the city of
Córdoba, who attend those Ranqueles nation.

The reason for using different ways these nations, is the enmity that have a with others, and
be more immediate to their lands to become as common in traffic, had to go through those of its
neighbors.

The other two roads is a matter that deserves more attention in the day, because we have no knowledge

Buenos Aires and his guards sugetos allocating adapted to the case,
with whose knowledge was easy with two expeditions come out of this
capital and Black River contain and restrain.

This proposal was welcomed, and Godoy and Gonzales sent with letters to habiéndolos SE, and this
being the first who ventured to walk the way through so many Indians, and given knowledge
to the journey made by the pilot D. Paul Sisur by land to the establishment,
both had the unfortunate end to stop at a prison, which prison he
delivered his own innocence.

Notwithstanding the contempt with which it was my proposal, the continued
abuse and theft Indians forced the Viceroy Lord to identify shipments
that have come from Cordoba, Mendoza and the capital, but not the
Black River, which is the most immediate camp site to them
