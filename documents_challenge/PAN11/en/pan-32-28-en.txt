 How would knowing
from day to day, his body destroyed, the claws of death!

At about eleven o'clock came in the house Don Pedro Nolasco and his entire family is say, her
daughter and granddaughter, and were received in my room, where he had brazier and we were my
uncle and I with Neluco who had gone to visit him daily. Lita had head wrapped in a fluffy light
blue scarf, which enhanced the freshness sonrosadita your pretty face by the harshness of mountain
air, and all huddled gentle body in a gray wool shawl, a long coat. According came and spoke
in his style and rejoiced picturesque, bareheaded was unwrapping the head and body with their
graceful nimble hands half covered with red yarn mittens. Looking at her and staring at the sun
that flooded the valley, after a few days so black and so stormy as recent past, I do not know
What I got to see the granddaughter of Don Pedro Nolasco, something like the dove that returned
to the ark announcing that it had ceased and the wrath of God and all of nature arose from the
abyss of darkness cleansed of sins and iniquities of men. Don Pedro Nolasco was the walls shake
with the noise of their weightings of the loud and crude as temporary. Could not remember another
like him many years ago. He had been like no blood in those days and there was no fire for them
to reach to put him in heat. Well you knew without he pondered, the chamuscones that had been
given away because they smelled smoke from kitchen, and her skin was as cured sausages and
even soot. Mari Pepa saw no reason for many weights: one time had been like many others who had
passed and that would pass. The only thing he truly mortified that was private, and deprive
all in his house, going to do a bit of Don Celso company and see how he was health.
