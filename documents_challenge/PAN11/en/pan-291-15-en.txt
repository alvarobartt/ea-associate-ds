 Sometimes sacrificed much of
this prophecy, and so they killed many cattle and poultry, and some men and women.

Without these oracles, had that of Aperahua, where by a tree Troncon replied Oracle, which
was found near him much gold, and that of Pachacamac, the Yuncas approaches, and many others,
and in the region of Andesuyo, as in that of Chincha and Omasuyo, and other parts of this kingdom,
from which I could say more, but, as I said it in the first part [87], which deals with the
foundations, I will not desto rather than the oracles, which had more devotion all the Incas
with other nations, sacrificed some men and women and many cattle, and to where there was this
credit, no human blood was not killed men, but they offered gold and silver. At guacas who had
less, they were like shrines, they offered beads and feathers and other small things of little
value. I say this because the opinion The Spanish have to say that in every temple they sacrificed
men, is false; and this is the truth according to what I caught, without pulling or put more
of what I understood and for me I have indeed.

Here goes well, that is understood, what the Capaccocha, respect for all was the service of the
temples and these and other, and by news that has old Indian they are alive and saw what happened
on this, I'll write what I have understood that it true. And they say that you had the habit
in Cuzco, for kings, which each year they made to come to that city to all the statues [88] and bundles
of idols that were in the buried treasures, which were the temples where they worship, which
were brought with great reverence Camay for priests and Dellas, parks guardians name, and as they
entered the city, were acknowledge them as received with great festivities and processions
and the room in places for that were identified and established, and having come from the
districts of the city, and even most of the provinces, large number of people, both men and women,
which reigned, accompanied by all the Incas and apricots, courtiers
and rulers of the city, they understood making great parties and drinking
and táquis.

They placed in the plaza of Cuzco the great chain of gold that encircled all, and so much wealth and
stones, as you can think of what has been the treasures questo eScript kings possessed; This
past was understood as every year they are used, which was, orchestras statues and packages and
priests gathered to find out through the mouth of them observing the event of the year, if
he would be fertile, or if he was to be sterile, if the Inca had long life, or if it even would die
that year, if enemies were to come somewhere, or if some of the peaceful they were to reveal. In
conclusion, were cross-examined about these things and other major and minor that will soon
crumble, because also wondered if there was fever, or if any homesick Vernia for livestock,
and if there would be multiple of a lot.

And this was done and asked not to all oracles together, but every man for himself: and if every
year the Incas did not do this, vivian went very modest and very unhappy and fearful, and did not
have their lives for granted.

And so glad the people and made its drunkenness a solemn banquets and other large táquis parties
that they use, different across to ours, where the Incas are with big win and at his expense treats
are made, that sum had large jars of gold and silver vessels of other things, because all the service
of his kitchen, to the pots and cups service was gold and silver, - sent to those who for what
were identified and had the time of High Priest, who was also present to the holidays with
such great pomp and triumph as the king himself, accompanied by priests and virgins who had
assembled there - that would make to each idol a question about these things, and he replied by
the mouth of the priests who had by their bulk, and these, as they were well inebriated, divined
what most Viana to the taste of those who asked, invented by them and by the devil, quests in those
statues. And made the questions to each idol, the priests being so astute in evil, Algund
term called to respond to that with more devotion and hear his credit Dellos ravings, because
they said they wanted to do their sacrifices, for being pleasant to the high their gods, were
served to respond to what was to be, and so were brought many animals, sheep and lambs, and
guinea pigs and birds, which passed the number of sheep more than two mill and sheep, and
they were slaughtered, by their exorcisms and demonic sacrifices vain to their manner, and then
denounced what they dreamed or what they pretended, or perchance
what Devil told them, and to give the answers, had a great mind to
look at what they said and formed in a few Dellos the event or good
or bad, and so they made with other answers, to see what was right
was telling the truth and what was to be in the same year.

This done, then left the begging of the kings with the offerings they call Capaccocha, and joining
the alms were usually returned to the temples of idols, and if last
year perhaps had one of those dreamers successful, happily ordered
it was the Inca from home.

The Capaccocha, as I was offering that is paid in lieu of tithes to the churches, of many gold and
silver vessels and other parts and stones, and loads of rich rugs, and much livestock. And
to those who had left uncertain and deceitful, not give them any offerings next year, before lost
reputation. To do this, we were doing great things in Cuzco, much more of what I write. And
now, after establishing the Audiencia Gasca and gone to Spain [89] between some things that
were discussed in some lawsuits, mention was made of this Capaccocha;
and this and everything else that we eScript is true that to and used.

And count agora of the great feast of Hatun Raimi [90].

CAP. XXX .-- How he did big festivals and sacrifices to the big party called solene Hatun Raimi.

Many
parties were in the year the Incas, where they made great sacrifices as to the custom of them, and
put them all in particular, was necessary to make it only one volume; and also do little and before
you should not try to count the rantings and witchcraft that they were doing, for certain causes,
and only the party of Hatun porno Raimi [91] because it is named. In many provinces are kept,
and was the principal of the year and they rejoiced over the Incas, and more sacrifices they
made, and this event celebrated last August, when they had taken their mails, potatoes, quinoa
[92], goose [93], and other seeds sown. And called to this feast, as I said, Hatun Raimi, which
in our language means very solene party, because she had to give thanks and praise to the great
God maker of heaven and earth, whom he called, as I have often said, Ticiviracocha, and Sun, and to
the moon and the other gods to his own, for they have given good year of crops for maintenance.
And to celebrate this event with greater devotion and solemnity, are said that ten or twelve
days fasting, abstinence from eating too much and not sleeping with their wives and drink only
in the morning, when they eat, chicha, and later in the day, so only water and not eat chili,
or bring anything into the mouth, and others among them cirimonias were kept in such fasts.
That past, had brought to Cuzco large sum of lambs and sheep, and doves and guinea pigs, and birds
and animals, who kill to make sacrifice, and having the crowd of cattle slaughtered, blood
smeared with Dell's statues and figures of their gods, or devils, and the gates of the temples and
oracles, to which hung the offal, and after spending some time, the soothsayers and diviners
looked in the light their signals, like the heathen, preaching what they wanted, which gave them
much credit.

And finish the sacrifice, the grand priest with the other priests went to the temple of the sun,
and after saying his psalms cursed, sent out to the virgins virgins herded richly and very many
quella chicha had made, and among those who were in the great city of Cuzco ate the cattle and
poultry for slaughter had vainly dead, and drank of that chicha, which had held sacred, giving
it to drink in large vessels gold, and she sat in silver pots of
many who were in the temple.

And having eaten and drunk often, still, and the king and the grand priest as everyone else, happy and
warm dello well, being little more than noon, were put into order and the men began to sing Christmas
carols loudly and for such romances days for their elders was invented, it was all thanks to
their gods, promising to serve RECEIVED benefits. And for this they had many golden drums
engastonados some in jewels, which rang them [94] their wives, along
with the sacred virgins helped them to sing.

And in the middle of the square was wearing, to what they say, a large theater with bleachers,
very feathers adorned with panels of gold-filled beads, and blankets of their much larger delicious
fine wool Argenteria planted gold and jewels. On top of this they placed the throne Ticiviracocha
figure of his great and rich, which, as they had for God's sovereign maker of the servant,
put him on top and gave him the most eminent, and all priests stood by him, and the Inca with the
main and common people were going to Mocha, pulling the sandals,
barefoot, with great humility, and shrugged his shoulders and puffing
out his cheeks, blowing towards him, making the mocha, which is to
say reverence.

Deste below throne had the figure of the sun, which I dare not say what was done, and also they
placed the moon and other packages of gods carved on sticks and stones, and create letores, we have
very certain, that neither in Jerusalem, Rome, or Persia, or in any part of the world, no republic
or king was collected in a place so rich in metals gold and silver and jewels as the square of
Cuzco, where these and other similar parties you were doing, because the packages were removed
from the Incas, their kings, already dead, each with appliance service and gold and silver they
had, say those who having been in good life and courageous, pious with the Indians, they make
grants generous, forgiving of insults; for to this such saints canonized by his blindness, and served
his bones, not understanding that the souls were burning in hell, and believed quest in the
sky. And do the same, was of some other dried apricots or any other nation, that for some
causes that were in their paganism, the also called saints. And they call this way of Ylla
canonized, which means body that was good in life [95], and other
understandings, yllapa means thunder or lightning, and so call the
Indians to yllapa artillery shots, the noise that do [96].

Then together the Inca and the grand priest with the courtiers of Cuzco and many people who
came of the districts, taking their gods put in thalamus, mocha, which is to make obeisance,
what they wore offering many gifts of gold statues and sheep small gold and figures of women, all
small, and many others [97] jewels. And they were at this event Hatun Raimi fifteen or twenty
days in which they made great táquis and drunkenness and other holidays
his style, which last gave an end to sacrifice, putting the bulk of
the idols temples, and the Incas killed in their homes.

The high priest had that dignity for her life, and was married, and was so esteemed that competed
in the Inca reasons, and had power over all oracles and temples, and removed and put priests.
The Inca and he played many times at his games, and it was these such grand powerful lineage
and relatives, and did not give a dignity to the low men and dark, although Nobles .-- they
had much merit called all who lived in the Cuzco they called anancuzcos orencuzcos and [98],
and children descendants of them, although other parties residing in other lands. I remember,
being in the last year Cuzco mill five hundred and fifty for the month of August, after having
taken their fields, enter Indians with their wives in the city with great noise, bringing the plow
in the hands and some straw and corn, to celebrate in just sing and say what they used to celebrate
in the past their crops. And because they do not allow the apos [99] and priests orchestras
parties Gentiles made in public, as usual, or what consintirian secret, if they knew, but as
has many thousands of Indians not to have become Christians, to believe is that, where not see,
what they will antojare. Ticiviracocha figure, and the sun and moon, and large gold rope, and other
familiar pieces have not been found, nor an Indian, nor chripstiano who can not hit upon where they
are [100], but even a lot, this is too much for what is buried in
Cuzco and the oracles and in other parts of this grand kingdom.

For brevity the more I wrote what I understood from the governorship and custom of Incas, I
return to my escriptura to tell what hobo from Manco Capac to Huascar, as earlier promised.
And so, dest as other do not give much notice the pears, because, the truth, did little things,
because the inventors of eScript and the most courageous all were
Inca Iupanqui and Tupac Inca his son and his grandson, Huayna Capac,
but also the cause of reason, that I have eScript, if they the latest.

Then, then, that Manco Capac was dead and made him the general crying osequias, Sinchi Inca Roca takes
the fringe or crown with cirimonias usual, trying to stretch after the house of the sun and furnish
to it the more people he could with praise and great offers, calling, named as the new population,
Cuzco. And some of the Indian state's natural, that where was the great square, the same approaches
that we now have, had a small lake and bog water was difficult for them till the big buildings
that they wanted to start and build, but, as this was known by King Sinchiroca [102], aims
to help its allies and neighbors undo that Palud, blinding him with large slabs and sliced ??thick
paving above where the water used to be, so that was as now we see it. And still have more that
the whole valley of Cuzco was sterile and never gave good fruit land that of what they have sown,
and that in the grand mountains of the Andes brought many thousands loads of land, which stretched
around him, with which, if true, was the valley very fertile, as
now we see it.

This Inca hobo in his sister and wife many children, the largest named Lloque Yupanqui [103]. And
as seen by their neighbors to Cuzco the good order which had the new settlers in he was, and
how he brought his friends love more people and not for weapons binivolencia or rigor, some captains
and principal men came to take his talks with them, rejoiced to see the temple of Curicancha
and good order with which they governed, and that was because they signed with them friends
of many parts. And say again that as hobiesen come to Cuzco, including these I say, a captain
of the village called ZANU [104], not far from the city, Sinchiroca begged [105], with great
veemencia to put it, she might rely upon rather than a daughter he had very handsome and beautiful,
wanted to take it for women to receive his son. Got this for the Inca, grieved, because that
was what was asked something, that if granted, went against the established and ordained by
his father, and if not granted to this captain said, nickel and the other men had for the treatment,
they were not publishing more than for himself. Y having taken counsel with the apricots and major
city, all that ought to paresció to receive the maiden to marry his son, because until they had
more strength and power guide had not at that case as he directed his father. And, they say
it responded the father of which was to be wife of his son who brought her, and made the wedding
with all solemnity, his custom and manner, and in Cuzco was called Coya, and a daughter who had
King, who was to be his brother's wife, was placed in the temple of Curicancha, whither had already
priests and sacrifices were made before the figure of the sun, and had porters to guard women
as sacred as it is told. And as this marriage was made, have the Indians that this bias is coupled
with the citizens of Cuzco, and making great treats and drunkenness, confirmed their brotherhood
and friendship to be all some, and therefore made great sacrifices in the hill and Tampuquiro
Guanacaure and he himself Curicancha temple. That past, gathered over four youths mill, and
made the cirimonias that this had been invented, they were armed men and were held by nobles, and
they were torn ears and put them to use that round they used to.

After this and other things that happened to King Sinchiroca, we do not know, after being old
and leaving many sons and daughters, died and was very crying and wailing, and made him osequias
very sumptuous package for keeping its memory had been good, believing that his soul resting
in heaven.

Dead, as has been counted, Sinchi Roca, Lloque Yupanqui, his son, he was received by Lord, having
first fasting day for this identified, and their guesses as and thought it had great hope that in future
the city of Cuzco was to Florescer, the new king began to ennoble with the new buildings in
it were made, and prayed, to what they say, to his father, wished with all his allies and confederates
to go live to his city, to where he would save his honor and Terni The party she wanted. And
ZANU lord or master [106] doing so, was given and noted for housing the most West Berlin, which,
being on slopes and hills, called Anancuzco; and the plain and lower, he remained the king
and his house and neighborhood, and as we all were dried apricots, approaches to saying nobles,
and nearly all hobiesen been found a new city, tuviéronse always distinguished the people who lived
in both places in the city, called Anancuzco and Orencuzco. And even some Indians wanted to say
that the Inca had to be a one desto lineages, and one from another, but I have certainly not,
nor is more than the dried apricots count, that is what is already eScript. On the one hand
and the other part of the city had large neighborhoods in the hills, because she was behind
on hills and ravines, as told in First Part of this crown [107].

Relationship are not in these times hobiese notable war, before they assert, that those of Cuzco,
gradually, with good tricks that this had, cleave unto his friend of many people the regions
of your city and the temple of Curicancha acrescentaban and buildings as wealth already sought
gold and silver metals, and them came much to the city to tianquez [108] market or therein to, and
in the temple metíanse women not to leave the second and as has been said elsewhere.

And in this way Lloque reigning Yupanqui in Cuzco, pasándosele the most of his time, Allegan
to be very old, without his wife's child. Despite showing a lot of the neighbors dello city,
made great sacrifices and prayers to their gods, as well as in Guanacaure Curicancha, and Tamboquiro,
and say that one of those oracles which were [for] answers vain heard that the Inca would engender
child to succeed to the kingdom which he showed much happy and joyful in hope, put the old king
on his wife Coya, and such taunts, to within a few days, clearly knew to be pregnant and gave
birth to their time a son.

Lloque Yupanqui died, sending first the fringe or crown of the empire were laid and deposited Curicancha
in the temple until the age their child had to reign, which began by Mayta Capac name, and the
governors say that he left two of his brothers names which did not understand.

Inca Yupanqui died, was mourned by all the servants of his house, and in many parts of the city,
according to the blindness they had, they killed many women and children, to think you had to go
to serve the sky where they had already certain that his soul was, and sanctifying by holy, sent the biggest
of the city that was made to remove the package holiday to them to. And true, there is great
preparation that was done to bury one of these kings, and generally in all the provinces he wept,
and many of them are shorn women, tightening ropes of straw, and the year after they made a howling
and sacrifices heathen, much more than you might think. And this, which is found in the Cuzco year five
hundred and fifty mill, they would see what happened there on the funeral of Paul [109] when
he made his year out, that was then, that most of the owners of the city rose to his house
to see, and I found myself present, and was to devise some admiration. And it is plain understand
that it meant nothing in comparison to the past. And tell agora Mayta Capac.

Lastly, then, what has been eScript, Mayta Capac, was doing great, who, after cirimonias have
done that were required, we were open ears, and being more man, in the presence of many nations,
natural and foreign, that this came together, rescebió the crown or tassel of the empire: and because
they had married sister with whom he took to to wife a daughter of a [110] SEÑORET or captain
of the town of Oma, who was the [111] Cuzco two leagues, which had named Cahua Mama Pata.

Made the wedding, was a neighborhood near the city where he lived a race of people whom Alcaviquiza
called [112], and these had not wanted to be friends with any of Cuzco, and were filled with
suspicions of each other, say that water going to take a wife of Cuzco to certain sources that
were there came a boy from another neighborhood and broke the pitcher and spoke not know what words
which, screaming, he returned to Cuzco, and as these Indians are so alharaquientos, then left
with their weapons against the other, who had also taken their own noise that they heard, to
see what came of the business, and came with the Inca People nearby were placed in order of
battle, having taken on something as light as pretext between India and boy had passed, to want
to subjugate those of the lineage or the memory Dell lost.

This is for those of Alcaviquiza well was understood, and as men of courage, they went to war with
grand courage, which was the first to be given at the time, and fought great time and one
as the others, because, having been the case so Supit, had not been getting of favors or seek
help from Alcaviquiza, which, although much fought, were defeated after being killed all over,
that hardly fifty escaped with their lives. And then King Mayta Capac, taking possession in
the fields and fields of the dead, using the winner, distributed it all for the citizens of Cuzco,
and made great feasts for the victory, going all to sacrifice to the sacred oracles they had for.

Deste
Inca did not have the apricots over Mayta Capac reigned at Cuzco
few years, and being aide to people to leave what they call Condesuyo,
there came such a disease, that hobo died, leaving as his heir to
the eldest son, called Capac Yupanqui.

It seems to me, referring to this Incas at the beginning of the founding
of Cuzco reigned in that city The Indians have little of it; and,
indeed, must be what they say, that among the Incas, Dellos were four
or five [which] both identified and ordered and did what and [I] eScript.
