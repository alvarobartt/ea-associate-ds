 To other people that there was, they sent to
stay at the door do Inca Yupanqui was and that if they feel some people DIN inside, enter at once
all and who would look for his master.

And this fact, people who took the Inca Yupanqui had commanded them, and throwing forward fifty
Indians, one by one, two by two, covered with their blankets (like that), very discreetly, and
well who had left had sent ahead saliesen Inca Viracocha, which fifty Indians were discovered, looking
for his enemies. And as they were scattered and large space each other, an Indian one of those
who went ahead as they came together at the broken firing and stream discharge was do the straw,
saw the enemy ambush, which, as they saw looming, dejáronse all fall on the straw, I thought I
had seen. And this Indian as the saw, sat on the floor and made to tie spent some tie his shoes,
dissimulation which was a sign and warning to his companions that behind came, which, as might
see him in the way that you have heard of one another became the new to the two gentlemen who
behind them came, which, as it was understood that ambush, sent to all yours is collected
and together there they do the voice had taken, except at fifty that had gone before, whom
I commanded that went around looking at and discovering those who were in the ambush if they left
or went ahead, and send to that tied shoes, coming a lowly Indian to him which tell him showing
that tied and untied shoes and other things of his to bring, which might show dissimulation of
what had understood.

And leaving it in this state, back to Inca Yupanqui, who, as provided on hobiese what you heard,
begged his father to prison pisase those logos there Uscovilca had brought him, which said Viracocha
Inca, who did not want to, if not stepped Urco first Inca, and Inca Yupanqui to this he said that
because he was her father and I have respect dalle obidient and as such their Lord, had he been there
to his people that he pisase, and beg him to ansímismo returned to their village and city of
Cuzco, for he, like his father and in his name he had won that company, he wanted out of there
and go to town Cuzco and enter succeeding with those captains and Uscovilca things, because
that had been his intention and to which he had come there, that another way, that he had not
Quél bring what they had gained such pisase Urco Inca, his eldest son. And finish saying that
his father Inca Yupanqui Inca Viracocha, ordered to take the clothes and the rest of Uscovilca,
and ordered the prisoners to lift the soil, which until that hour had been lying on the ground,
and so he got out Inca Yupanqui, and run angry that his father had not stomping on prisoners and
their loved what you heard. And his father had pesábale be so wrong with him that he wanted to
kill and bring about death, seeing it in himself that he had not given cause wherefore of
angry e hobiese had ill will, but before attempting and had sought to make all service, and
make all pleasure and contentment, and how they know that anger and passion of it thou had was for
envy to see quel escedia all his brethren, both had some passion for it.
