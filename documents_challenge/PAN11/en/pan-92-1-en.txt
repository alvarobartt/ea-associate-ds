 

I repeat that I learned the consequent feeling of such provisions, I respected and respect
as a Spanish citizen, the sole state in this place, if you can just be the basis to support these
provisions, it would be difficult to prove the justice, public policy and convenience which
demand otherwise. But not having taken the pen to enter into such an issue, I separate it, and
step to my attempt, which is none other than give a small memory reasoned, any ideas and news
of what our Philippine Islands, with the laudable object in my memory and memories of those
islands, the inhabitants see my gratitude and wishes to contribute to its prosperity, which I always
interesaros more expensive than I can.

As the most esplícita proof of the above, remember the Government, the Spanish all on behalf
of my friends overseas, and purge the constant loyalty of the Philippine Islands not denied in any
way today, but of the many terrible swings policies because the Peninsula has gone so far in this
century, is a creditor consideration to all the distinguished Government today rije the destiny
of the motherland, and to attention colejisladores Corps, so that when the case reached into
the discussion of the special laws should govern these provinces, prevailing only the desire
to make them happy, to improve their lot and condition, is reached at the end desired, and are
facilitating the development of their prosperity by the most brief and simple. Those are my
main desires, and believe I can contribute in some way to illustrate the opinion of those who do
not know what our Philippines, I have decided to coordinate some notes and notes that leisure time
on other days I wrote about useful reforms that can and should made in the Philippines to achieve
as interesting objects, such as to pursue their development and prosperity.

The committee proposes and say carries, but the stamp of authority
and power of prestijio, at least the belief that long experience has
given me, living in the Philippines: reason and the need to call for
these reforms, the effect of the lights of the century, and see that
after three hundred years that we have this beautiful part of the
Asian world, just we get those precious blankets countries of birth
for Spain that will put the Legaspi immortal.

His story is a test and do not object to this truth: its conquest and what the tradition has passed
down to us than were those islands, every reason the need to address them with any more attention
than even this, to facilitate demanding improvements, and that are subject to little or no
cost.

It should be noted however, that some of the means used in its conquest, building and conservation,
and any subsequent changes made, can always be useful; and based reforms such principles, and
respecting their traditions and customs as do not object to those, produced all the effects are desired.
That this is so, none or very few will doubt, and therefore should
repeat that the lejislador that lejisla for any state, must not lose
sight of their habits and customs, and respect, as possible is moving
in that attempt, the institutions that exist, as the basis of such
principles, is very likely to produce the desired reforms.

On the contrary, if the lejislador maims and rips the story of a country, destroying their
institutions, and does not respect ancient customs all for carrying into effect the changes that
theory has been strongly advise your imagination, you can with the utmost good faith, intention
and desire, can not cause harm to compensation, for easy and even possible is that in this case
the people start to grumble, keep bitching and moaning, and conclude by lifted as powerful
as it is, and to the carelessness of the further lejislador war with its disasters, and the revolution
with their crimes. So, keep in mind that laws should be similar to that given country, they always
respected in certain principles, fundamentals and practices that are rooted more and more, and
strengthen the prosperity of peoples and happiness of their inhabitants.

Lately, I hope that when you get into the hands of my friends in the Philippines this small tribute
of my gratitude, I dedicate them, only to see it my votes directed by happiness of those provinces,
and across much of them can write, no more ambition than the step of giving an idea of ??its
importance and merit, to promote useful reforms demanded the preservation of peace, alleviation
of taxes, and improve their status and condition, providing for such honorable means prosperity
for all its inhabitants, which the fancy for all can be more expensive than

MEMORY

ON

THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

                            The Philippines, for its great expanse, its advantageous position
in the center of the world Asia's trade, by its considerable population,
and the fertility of its soil, susceptible how many are bred productions
between the two Tropics, claiming the Government of the Metropolis
an orderly system of orders and reforms, while more and more entrenched
their peace and internal security, as indispensable as necessary to
the preservation, promotion agriculture, industry and trade to that
eminent degree of prosperity to which they are called for the many
items which themselves contain rich, and he seems are destined for
Providence, which has been lavishly promoted with the situation and
as bright as fertile soil.

                             

                      

Encouraged me, and wanting it so interesting purposes are made, I have determined to form this small
memory, with the dual purpose of releasing news of the state as they were the Philippines to my
departure from them, and presenting some of the many obstacles to development of prosperity and
wealth, and means that could be used to destroy them, excite the greatest talents of others,
with more time to address this important subject, to more thoroughly and more precisely, spread
abroad his comments on the subject, to influence the mind of the enlightened Government today rije
destinations in the country, and provide by this means the useful reforms to the state of
the provinces of the Philippines calls for advance prosperity and greatness.

For my part I will stick as much as possible, to indicate only the effect as an EXPERIENCE twelve years
of residence in the Islands has taught me, can help to establish the field justice more fixed than
that observed, and improve the administration of the estate public: branches must undergo
major reforms in the day as they are, and can produce wonderful effects and incalculable benefits,
so the islands as to the metropolis.

I hope that those who deign to honor me by reading my humble thoughts, I waive all their indulgence
for defects to be noted, purely to see in my desire lines laudable
improvements in the Philippines in the classes that you made mention,
and if these poorly coordinated any benefits or phrases proves useful
for those countries, with only this would be rewarded with interest
the wishes of the speaker, for the satisfaction of having contributed
to the achievement of very interesting objects in any part, however
small that this was a unique event that yearns Award for the zeal
which cherishes in his heart to such a degree as that but for the
good and happiness of all the inhabitants of those islands, whom professes
the purest affection, retains and always keep the best sympathies
and fondest memories.

PART ONE.

§. I.

ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

That prompt and proper administration of justice is the first base of happiness, good order and peace
of all peoples of the world, no one can doubt, and that in any Astrea nation which does not exercise
his royal rule across the full of his power, not more that confusion and disorder, serious evils
of transcendence, of outrage and pain, is also a I really do not need proof, being well known.
Indeed, where justice does not prevail, nothing good can be: innocence is no safe haven anywhere;
seeds discord abound want to do, the barbarous law of force with
tyranny oppresses the weaker; and finally, how evil can afflict mortals,
many are gathered in villages in the realms, where benefits are unknown
influences of justice.

Philippines, that precious jewel of the East, as it has been qualified
and justice for other pens before mine, it has throughout its extent
the beneficial influence of Astrea, nor any the readiness to desire
it off: it is necessary to remove certain obstacles that will to be
provided, and to raise a total reform, as will be later, or taken
other establishing enough to effect, and this achieved, is the first
step for the happiness of the Islands; industry remain as interesting
as the foot and form that is raised, is the largest obstacle to their
prosperity, and impossible to move one step forward, or it can have
its good effects of laws, wiser, more just and far-sighted they are.

It will show: -

§. II.

LAND OF THE HEARING.

The high consideration and respect that the audience deserves Manila among the Indians, from even
the tradition among them, remembering those happy days when their magistrates visiting their provinces,
and they made during these visits as well to the people [1].

The judges guests were in fact more severe than a judge, a friendly mediator in disputes of India,
to compositions, celebrated transactions, noted land boundaries, and even in terms of people,
gave a sort of municipal ordinances that were observed, and protejian against the abuse of the
mayors, correjidores, and even knew in which caused some priest, because as in these visits was
not impose penalties, execute punishment, nor adapted with violence, but minds together, cutting
disagreements, and make disappear dissension between families, between neighbors and even among
peoples, these visits were truly a parental visits and charity, and in them the Orijen High respect,
consideration and appreciation of the magistrates.

Disappeared these visits, Like many other things that both prestijio
acquired the Spanish name, and with them a large element of many goods
do not cause no harm: return to old form and, about not being easy,
nor would produce the goods as before, for reasons that about being
long enumerate, are of this place.

However, to promote its restoration in the form given limited powers
and at certain periods, it would be an asset of incalculable benefit
and best consequences.

But the well of the Manila audience (say what they want their antagonists) I have a very convenient
for the disposition of the Indian Act, as to the amobilidad and time given to promotion of their ministers,
just scale should establish, found on the same grounds for the law, without searching for others,
some are very to everyone, that is, that not only is useful to reward its magistrates, but
also uprooted from friends and close relations that come in those countries where long time
resident. These friends of influence, if prejudicial to the administration line of justice are in
Manila an almost necessary for the short Spanish population [2], the absence of any recreational
or public distraction, and that with the laxity of the climate, and customs and praise of
the country, you enter a life spoiled and soft and loses that Enerji integrity and European
customs to the few years of residence in the Islands. Yes, the Philippines is a country in
which mental tasks and may be frequent or long; country that leans to leisure and pleasure
more than others, for its mild temperament produces all the lax habits behind its climate, and even
effeminate weakens the spirits, and cause the greater damage, the more vivid are the passions,
especially to youth. But back to our purpose, although it is not strange to him the idea issued.

The
audience of Manila has sought at all times with more or less effectively give further impetus
to the administration of justice in the islands with vast territory,
but the effects never have responded to their good wishes, because
there are natural obstacles that his authority can be overcome.

Of them will be discussed in the third paragraph, when speaking of the mayors and correjidores,
let us try to those who can overcome.

The incompetence of those in junior destinations salable and renounced, is an obstacle and
not a little package, to give impetus to the administration of justice. Scribes chamber receivers
and attorneys do not know or do not seek anything but to get the full potential of their offices.
These trades are very small numbers and little benefit, because in the vast expanse of military jurisdiction
in the wealthy people of the Philippines, the audit of war has all civil cases so important
in the Islands, and the audience is limited to criminal cases and land disputes between Indians
and not of much value, lawsuits and has the sole business of any trade value since the publication
code in that country, but these, not many, not too serious, which is not deactivated when
the idea you have some much consideration, but not what Gen.: reasons for not possible or
easy to buy and enter taught Spanish to serve those trades hearing. The consequences of this
are delays and losses on the early administration justice, the greater disorder in the offices
of the hearing, the lack of books of seats, registrations, and state laws prevent relationships
and, finally, that to stretch it out a Order or trade, it must always
do a minister who takes this job.

This Thin story, nothing exaggerated, you can easily know how many there will be difficulties
to overcome in order to march as best that can be, and not as it should, the administration of justice;
and for further proof of this truth, go down to explanations and
details more retail discussing some of the ideas expressed, and other
obstacles stating no less bulk, and that can be removed easily.

That the administration of justice is slow, even in the extreme, heavy in the Philippines,
I think is a truth is not brought into question, but for those who may doubt it will bring
reflections following.

Manila's audience consists of one room, who knows and fails on second and third instance all
kinds of business of the thirty-one provinces (today and thirty-two) which includes its territory
Este. A regent, five ministers and two prosecutors, its endowment, which very few times is complete,
and under the réjimen and how ordinary legal substantiation is observed, is impossible and
any failure to provide early and ongoing failure to matters of attribution. The various committees
outside of his ministry that weigh about the same magistrates, very serious and many of them,
is another obstacle, and not small, to be administered promptly and effective justice. Indeed,
income assistance and supervision of the finances public, a charge more than regular occupation
continues to be a good lawyer, if you have to serve which corresponds,
has been from 1829 to 1839, which was provided by particular lawyer,
in charge of the ministers of the audience, and with actual appointments
with neglect and contempt of the law of India [3], which instructs:
the judges are no more than judges, and have no commissions, rather
than those that the court gives them, etc. The advice of government
is another top destination as before, and has also been played by
a magistrate a few years.

In 1837 was provided in another particular lawyer. The Audit of War Marine and also was served
a few years by another magistrate, and although in 1830 the auditor was war appointed by the King,
and took charge of his office, not the Marines who, but suffer mistake, even today plays the same
magistrate. It should be noted that these destinations assignments have decent, and have great
emoluments by reason of fees, and one and others, the salaries of
ministers, have enjoyed these at once, when they have served these
jobs.

The court of dead and missing property, an institution that should be preserved and give her
best, as we shall tell you the reasons be expressed in a separate paragraph is another position
that turns among the magistrates of every two years [4], and this
court is matters of importance, but that is a lot or a little bump
your organization, it is certain that There are far behind him, and
that their course is in the extreme slow, do not observe the law signal
is sent every week day to see these fights [5].

A former top joint Real Estate (discontinued now) attended as member of the regent of the hearing,
and failing the senior judge or minister oldest: the infinite expedients that knew, and whom he
output was to give a preference, occupying more than you can say, and much more, since in this
kind of business is accustomed always leave with more caution and care, the immediate financial
liability they caused, and the particular circumstances of being the only lawyer who was involved in
their decisions the minister of the audience, convince certainty to any of the above, and
that obviously went into them warily. Currently, the top joint finance litigation is composed
by three ministers, under General-president of the local deputy superintendent Finance [6], and
its business, but as many as the top joint of the former do not give in to gravity. The hall
call justice, which is the second known instance of the cars appealed the regional court and
audience of the day, also up three ministers, and in view of fiscal of civil, it's become, hear and
rule on such cars, which expedients, processes or causes, for some three names to fit you, yours
are bulky and complicated by nature and lots of points to embrace, and are therefore subject
to occupation and severity; and though not much, also distract and occupy the same business
when still in progress are room visits or calls from PC board that comprises Mr. regent or oldest
minister in a civil attorney, where as for advice, referral for consultation counter greater when
you like. A board of auctions also attend the ministers and civil attorney, who is also heavy and
irksome occupation. Finally, a lord judge rotated annually in the office of judge of sororities
and fraternities, and another is an advisor to cross what is the oldest generals, who with
the tax commissioner and civil, comprising the court of the bull, and I have some gratification
but small. Another is director of the Monte Pio, another guard, another judge of slavery and
freedom, another judge of hospitals and nursing homes rides and married expulsion to Spain [7]
being separated from their women: law fall obsolete as many good laws, another is a judge of
protocols and lower courts, and in all these units is occupation, as no shortage of issues
and different business and by necessity all the progress must be slow and even late, and they
that are themselves or any serious complication.
