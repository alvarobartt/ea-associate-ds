 And I seemed to see her at my side, kneeling before the altar.

On the balcony, open wide, reaching to me, on the wings of the breeze, the rumors river, rustling
trees, the hum of insects, the hissing of reptiles, bard winged vibrant voice. Opened before
me long avenue of trees. Light the moon passed through the foliage and drew circles on the
white sand drift. Neighbors in the last orange blossoms opened.

Beautiful night
