 This points to the Spanish quest
in Peru who claim to know many secrets dest, I understand that I knew and understand what
they think they know and understand and much more, and all agreed that written what they see, and
that I spent working on it than themselves.

And so, say the big ears, that being things Inca Yupanqui in this state, determined out of
Cuzco with many people from war to what he called Collao and its regions, and thus, leaving
his governor in the city, went out of it and walked until he reached the great people of Ayavire,
where they say, not the natives of wanting to come into compliance, had cautiously and, taking
them neglected, killed all his neighbors, men and women, with do the same Copacopa those of [177]
and of slaughter of Ayavire was therefore all the more perished, but were not some who later
were astonished to see so great wickedness as crazy angry about the fields, he called his older
with great howling and words fearful [178]. And as the Inca hobiese fallen into the invention
so gallant and profitable mitimaes put, as he saw the beautiful valleys and Ayavire campaigns
and the beautiful river that passes by him [179], ordered them to come of the districts were
enough people with women to populate it, and so it was done, and it made for great buildings and
temples of the sun, and many tanks and casting house, so that, mitimaes village, was more Ayavire
principal before, and the Indians who have been wars and cruelty of the Spanish mitimaes are
all strangers and unnatural, so has eScript.

Without this feature again, that having gone through his command some people enough to captains
give Andesuyo war against those who are the towns and quests in the mountains, ran Snakes as big
as a thick wood, which killed all they could, therefore, who have not seen other enemies, the
war made them so artfully that came within the many who entered, and I have received great
anger the Inca to know that new, and being with their grief, a sorceress said she would go and stop
silly and tame snakes aforementioned, that they should not do evil to none but them same they
sit down. Appreciating the work, if accordance with that, he sent him to put an execution,
and did, by believing them and set no to me, because it seems fun, and charmed snakes, were
the enemies, and subjective many war and others for prayer and good
words that they had.

The Inca left Ayavire, say by the way they call Omasuyo, which for him width was made real as we
see it, and walked through the towns of Oruro [180], Asillo, Azangaro where he had some encounters
with the natives, but such words were said, that with them and gave them gifts, attracted
to his friendship and service, and from then on used for Pulici wearing
the others who had friendship and alliance with the Incas, and made
their concluded in the plain people of the plains.

Passing on Inca Yupanqui, have to visit the most towns bordering the Great Lake Titicaca, whose
very quick, brought all his service, getting in each suit people who used the natural thing of
great pleasure for them and that most loose. Entered into the great lake of Titicaca and the
islands looked in it are made by sending making them the largest sun temple and palaces for himself
and his descendants, and made in his Lordship, and all the rest of the vast region of Collao,
returned to the city of Cuzco with great triumph, to where he had, after it came in large parties
to make their custom, and most provinces came to him with great reverence,
present, and the governors and his delegates had great care to fulfill
all his orders.

CAP. LIII .-- How the left Cuzco Inca Yupanqui, and what he did.

Flying Inca Yupanqui fame in such a way over land, which was everywhere of his great deeds. Many, seeing
their flag or captain, he came to know and provide him vassals, affirming his sayings that
the sky had fallen their past, they knew live with both concert and honor. Inca Yupanqui, without
losing its gravity, I replied meekly did not want to do wrong to any nation, but they should
come and give him obedience, as the sun wanted and ordered. And hobiese around to make people call,
came out with all to what they call it Condesuyo and subject to the Yanaguaras and to the Chumbivilcas,
and some Desta provinces had stout Condesuyo region of battles, but, although he gave much
war their efforts and knowledge was therefore damage and death that many gave obedience, taking
by Lord, as did the others, and put in order, leaving the earth and made chiefs the natives,
and commanding that they should not insult or damage to these subjects, it became Cuzco, placing
first governors in the main parties, to impose on the the natural order that had to have, and
for housing to serve you and make their people together, and take
every great concert, and no one was injured, although were of the
poorest.

After this, have more, rested a few days in Cuzco, because he wanted to go in person to the Andes,
where they had sent their champions who would look and listen for the land and let you know
Art della they were the inhabitants, and as his orders were filled throughout the kingdom maintenance
of tanks, sent Quél that would provide the road had to carry, E was done so, and with the captains
and warriors left Cuzco, where he left the governor to for the administration of justice, and
through the mountains and snowy mountains, he knew his runners at the front, and the great wilderness
of the mountains, and even were the as large snakes breeding in these
thickets, did not hurt none, espantábanse to see how monstrous beasts
and they were.

As the natives of those districts were able to enter its land of the Inca, as many of them by
the hand of their masters had been put in service, we came to do the mocha, bringing present
in many bird feathers and coca and as they had in their earth, and very grateful to all. Other
Indians who lived in those mountains subjects who wanted to be, They
sent messengers, no, deserted villages and metiéronse with their wives
in the thick of the mountain.

Inca Yupanqui had great news that after a few days, to the Levant, had large and densely populated
land.

With this new, greedy to find out, he went on, but, being advised as in Cuzco had happened a stir,
and having friends and they a people Marcapata call, stirred it with great haste to Cuzco,
where he spent a few days.

After these, the Indians say, that as the province of Collao is so great and she had in those
days large number of people and dominions of the powerful natural as Inca Yupanqui knew they
had entered the mountains of the Andes, believing that there would be dead or would come undone,
concertáronse all at once, from Vilcanota forward, to one side and to another, with very great
secrecy, rebels and not be under the lordship of the Incas, saying it was all big smallness,
their parents having been free and not leaving them in captivity, secured much land and so
great a Lord alone. And all abhor the command that the Inca had on them without them having it
done hassle or wrong treatment, or made tyranny, not too much, as their delegates goberdadores
and not could understand, together Atuncollao and Chucuito, where they found Carl and Zapana
and Humalla, and the Lord of Azangaro, and many others, took the oath, according to his blindness,
to carry out his intention and determination, and to more firmly, drank a glass [181] all together,
and ordered to stand in a temple in the holy things, that was witness to what has been said, and then
slew the governors and delegates were in the province, and to many apricots were among them,
and across the kingdom was reported the rebellion of the Collao, and death that had given the
apricots, and with this new attempt developments in some parts of
the kingdom, and in many places arose, which hindered the Orders placed
mitimaes tapeworm and be warned the governors, and especially the
great value of Tupac Inca Yupanqui, who reigned from this time, as
I shall.

He showed public sentiment Inca Yupanqui to know the new hoist Collao before, with great courage,
he had to call people to go personally to the punishing, sent his messengers to the Canas and
Canches men, to be steadfast in their friendship, not the removal of the Collao make proud, and trying
to get ready to leave Cuzco, as either very old and are tired of the wars he had done and had
traveled roads, boy was so heavy and broken, that feeling soon enough for it, nor to hear the
governorship of this great kingdom, sent to the High Priest and dried apricots and most major city,
and said that he was already so old, it was for could you be beside the fire, not to follow
the real, and therefore it was saying and understood conoscian in all truth, to them to take
by Inca Tupac Inca Yupanqui, his son, young man worked as as they had been in the wars he
had done, and that would give the fringe to to be obeyed by all as Lord and esteemed as such,
and chelate are like those of skill daria Collao be punished for his rebellion and death he had
made to the apricots and delegates among them were. Responded to these words, which he was called,
which was done as ordered, and all Quél order what was served, because all would obey as it always had
done. [In] the Collao and the provinces of Canas Canches and made him with these large received
any rich, and he had done, as cache name, a palaces mode as they till, or showy.

Collas, they knew that Tupac Inca came against them so powerful, they sought favors of its
neighbors, and they gathered the most of them with her determination to wait in the field
give him battle. They took all of this notice Tupac Inca, and as he was so gracious, conoscia
but the advantage the enemy had sent them Canas of her neighbors, messengers that they were
told how his desire was not to have enmity with them or chastise according to how badly they
did, when without any fault slew the governors and delegates his father, if they would lay down their
arms and give obedience, as to be well governed and governed [182] Convention recognizes the
Lord and to be one and not many.

With the embassy sent a orejon with some presents for the chief of the Collas, but did not
pay anything or wanted their confederation before, the orchestra board made, taking by captains
the lords of the villages, closer to where I was venieron Tupac Inca and have all that in a town
called Pucara, went on there were strong, As was the Inca, had their war with the cry that often,
and finally gave battle each other, which killed many on both sides, and Collas were defeated
and many prisoners, both men and women, and fuéranlo more, if it gave rise to the scope will
continue, the Inca, the hardest working [183] ??and to Carl, lord of Chucuito, spoke harshly, saying,
How he had responded to the peace that brought his grandfather Viracocha Inga?, And that he wished
to kill but it would send to Cuzco, whither he would be punished, and so to this as to other prisoners
sent lead to Cuzco with guards, and a sign of the victory of the Collas that hobo on the site above,
ordered great lumps of stone, and breaking, by memory, a piece of a saw, and do other things
today, whoever had been there, you will see and notice, as I did I, I stopped two days to see
and understand the root [184].

The Collas who escaped the battle, they say, very scared of the occurrence, there were hurry
to flee, believing that they were going to Cuzco back, and so they went, with this fear, turning
occasionally the faces to see what they have not seen it have impeded the Inca. Desaguadero
last came together and taking all major his advice to each other, they resolved to send peace
to the Inca to ask, so if the bore with in his service, would pay the taxes that were raised from
debian, and would forever loyal. To address this was the shrewdest of them, and they found that came
walking Inca Tupac for them, and heard the embassy with good countenance, and replied with words
of Victor pious that he regretted what he had done because of them, and surely they could come to
Chucuito to where they would sit with peace in such a way that was beneficial to them. And heard
it, they kept him for work.

Sent provide many supplies, and went unto the Lord Humalla receive him, and spoke Inca OK, so
he and the other lords and masters, and before that they were peace, have that there were great
dances and drinking, and that finishes, being all together, he said did not want to be brought
to the need in you paying taxes that were due, as were very large, but that no reason or cause
it had risen, Quel had to put fittings ordinary people from war, [and] that would provide
for supplies and women to soldiers. They sad that they would do, and told that other lands
should come mitimaes for that, with the order that is said, and many people also culled the Collao,
putting that of some other peoples, and among them were governors and delegates to catch taxes.
This fact, said they had to pass a law so that you always wanted to do one knew what they had
been made, and it was that they could not ever get in Cuzco mill over many men and women across
the province, on pain of death if more dared enter the said. Desto were worth, but concediéronlo
as others, and it is true that if there was Collas in Cuzco, others dared not enter, if the number
was completed, until came out, and if you wanted to, could not, because the pickers portazgueros
and taxes and guards who had to watch what was in and out of the city, not allowed or consented,
and among them was not used bribery to do his will, nor ever told them their kings lie in any thing,
and discovered their secret, a thing of great praise.

Settled in the province of Collao and put in order, and telling them what they had to do Mr.
Dell, the Inca gave his back to Cuzco, first sending his messengers to Condesuyo and to the Andes,
and especially let him know what was happening, and whether its governance towards some wrongs,
and if the natives went in a few riots, and many people together and principal, he returned to
Cuzco, where he was received with great honor, and made great sacrifices in the temple of the sun, and
[by] hearing the work of the great building of the Casa Fuerte to build Inca Yupanqui had commanded,
and the Coya, his wife and sister, called Mama Ocllo made by other big parties and dances. And
as Tupac Inca had will to go on the road of Chinchasuyo to subdue the provinces that are further
along in Tarama and Bonbon, he ordered great appeal for people from all provinces.

This conquest of Quito did Tupac Yupanqui, I could well be longer, but I have so much to write
about other things, that I can not deal in both, but I do not want to have summarily what he did, then,
to understand, simply reported by the earth. Exit the king I wanted to make the city of Cuzco,
not knowing how much or where he was to be the war - because this is not said but to the counselors
- they gathered over two hundred thousand men, with so great background and parts, that filled
the fields, and the post was sent to the governors provinces that are regions favorable answer all
the supplies and ammunition and weapons Chinchasuyo the royal road, which was becoming not deviated
from his father has had, not even reached that could do it all. This road was great and proud, made
by order and the industry that has eScript, and everywhere had proveimiento for all many people
who were in real, with nothing missing, and the credit, none of the was his daring to catch
so only one ear of field corn, and if caught, not cost less than life. The natives carried the
load and to the other personal services but, believe that some have, that took them to the
place over limited, and as they did willingly and kept them so much truth and justice, they felt the
job.

Leaving people in Cuzco mitimaes garrison and governor to choose among the faithful friends of
his, left, led by his captain general and senior adviser to Capac Yupanqui his uncle, not the war
gave to those of Xauxa, because he said he hanged himself by the way anger, and as left Cuzco,
walked until they reached Vilcas, where he spent some days enjoying himself to see the temple and
quarters that there had been, and always commanded were silversmiths vessels and other parts styling
and jewelry for the temple and Vilcas real home.

Xauxa was, to where he made a solemn Huancas received, and sent everywhere messengers letting
them know how he wanted to win the friendship of all of them without making them them angry
or war, therefore, that because they heard that the Incas of Cuzco tyrannies they made no not too
much of it had by Confederates and vassal, and that payment for labor and tribute given to them,
engaged or Dellos much good to send him messengers to establish peace with him. In the grand
SUPOS Bonbon power with which the Inca came, and as they had understood great things of his clemency,
he went to reverence, and those of Yauyo did the same, and the Apurimac and many others, to
which he received very well, giving some women, to other coca, and to other blankets and shirts,
and putting the suit that had the province where he was, that was
where they received them happier.

Among the provinces between Xauxa and Cajamarca, have you had some wars and quarrels and ordered
great earthworks and forts to defend the natives, and with his good skill, without much bloodshed,
the subjugated, and do the same as in Cajamarca, and all governors and delegates left parties and
posts made to take notice and do not leave any without first province to have made large chambers
and temple of the sun and put mitimaes. Count, without it, it came to Huanuco and sent to the palace
as we see today cousin Indeed, that going to the Chachapoyas, gave so much war, which all point
aina routed them; but such words could tell them that they themselves are offered. Stopped
in Cajamarca the people of Cuzco much, that impose on the natives
on how they were to dress and the tribute that had to give, and especially,
how they were to worship and revere the sun god.

For all the more parties called him father, and had great care in order that any damage to the
land doeth he went, or forces to ningund man or woman, to which I did, then by his command gave
him the death penalty.

He tried to subdue with that were asked for peoples together and tidy and not them to attack
one another, nor eat, or committing other sins failed in natural law.

By Bracamoros came and went on the run, because it is bad that mountain land, in Avocado and
Guancabamba, Caxas and Ayavaca and its regions, had great work in subduing those nations,
they are warlike and rebustas, and had war with them over five moons, but, finally, they asked
for peace, and were given with conditions to the others, and peace
rested today and tomorrow was the province mitimaes filled with governors,
without removing the estate to the natives and to warehouses and put
in them keep and what more is sent to, and towards the real path to
the posts that had to be around him.

This land went to be Tupac Inca Yupanqui arrived at the Canaro, with whom also had his stubbornness
and quarrels, and that Dell still others, were by his subjects, and ordered them to be Dellos
mesmos to Cuzco, to be in the same city, more than fifteen thousand men with their wives and
main master of them, to have the hostages, and was made as sent. Some want to say questa Cañares
last of Cuzco was the time of Huayna Capac. And as of Tomebamba ordered great buildings and very shiny.
In the first part these rooms as they were tried and how much they were [185]. From this place
he sent many embassies to many villages of those districts, so that he wanted to come to see,
and many, without war, offered his service, and no, sending captains
and people, made them do what others did force their will.

Tidying the land of the Cañares, and went to Tiquizambi, Cayambi, the Purua [186] and many other
parts, into which tell of the many things he did, tanks of not believing, and knowing which
was to become king of so great kingdoms. In The Tacunga was fierce war with natural, and settled
peace with them after they were broken, and he ordered many and so insines buildings in these
parts, exceeding in most of perfection to Cuzco. Y La Tacunga wanted to be a few days, so that
their people rested, and almost every viníales Cuzco day state messenger that it was there,
and elsewhere always came messages and emails with big things in the regiment were ordered land
for their governors. Then came news of a stir there was in Cuzco between mesmos apricots, and
caused some alteration, suspicious of innovations, but, often, came another new how it was plain
and settled and had become the governor of the city in which large
punishments had caused the commotion.

De La Tacunga walked until they came to what we say Quito, where is founded the city of Sant
Francisco of Quito, and seems well that land, and that was as good as Cuzco there was foundation
of the population that hobo, whom he called Quito, and of mitimaes poblóla and did make great wine
cellars and buildings and warehouses, saying: "Cuzco is to be a part head and under my great kingdom,
on the other must be the Quito. "- He gave great power to the governor Quito, for the whole region
of Quito began his governors and delegates sent in Caranqui hobiese garrison of ordinary people
for peace and war, and other lands put people in them, and of these sent out to bring in the
others. Everywhere worshiped the sun and took the customs of the Incas, so much that it seemed that
all were born in Cuzco, and queríanle amábanle and therefore they
called him Father of all, good Lord, just and righteous .-- In the
province Cañares of, say he was born Huayna Capac, his son, and became
great parties
