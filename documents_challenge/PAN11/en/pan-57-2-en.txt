 This will, in time, to be able to play a real
place two thousand clerks in some, as my lord grandfather, rest in peace. I wish to make fortune,
because I love him with all my heart; and so, I want your worship, with his great wisdom and
universal wisdom, I report if it is possible get something out of this guy, saying at the same time
if I can count on your protection. Make it your grace, by God, which is the only son of his
sister, and we we are poor, we can not make you happy. "

His respectful and reverent server.

# # FERMIN ...

After three months without Don Elijah answered. Finally said, noting that he expected a bit,
which warn if he could come or not.

A month later he wrote again calling Lazarus at his side, adding that their behavior and provisions
to make fortune depended.

Lazarus was beside himself with joy. Wanted from the day, but the prayers of his mother and his
grandfather was forced to wait two more.

The young student knew from the traditions of the family that his
uncle was a very wise man, and had been craving that had to be a great
liberal.

Did not understand that a very wise man ceases to be a great lover of freedom.

Coletilla's letter was received in early September 1821, in which they occur the first events
we have referred. Shortly after the unfortunate scene barbershop and military input in the house
of Clara, Lazarus took the trip to Madrid.

Clara did not know before the day he was to come.

Now we can follow naturally the course of events in this timely story. Let Lazarus preparing
to depart. His mother and his grandfather crying fired, the mayor embraces saying that he sees
in it nothing less than a secretary of the Office, the priest gives
you two rolls maimones for the road and throws a tedious sermon.

The student goes to the galley, and money takes more wishful thinking than the way of the Court.

CHAPTER
VIII

# # Today comes.

Three days after the adventure described in Chapter Two, was clear very early locked in the
room that served as his bedroom. The fan had said a few hours rather than wait for his nephew, and
that it was necessary to accommodate there until they moved all to a new house that planned to
take.

Clara was rapt to hear this news and could not answer word, because the surprise the voice was upon
him. When left alone locked himself in his room.

This was small and irregular, was at the interior of the house, and
had a narrow window, with glasses of dubious transparency, which opened
onto a courtyard, the kind that so deep and narrow look real well.

Front and sides opened three rows of windows petty vents many other cells, where they lived
busy families. The room Clara had the usufruct of a light beam from eleven at eleven-thirty, when
he passed to illuminate the tropical regions of the third floor. One ray of light never brought
no color or landscape, or horizon, no joy.

The courtyard was crowded room, the center of a human hive.

At certain times protruded for those holes so many heads: this happened in the big events
when the blacksmith on the ground floor and the room ironing resolved
an issue outdoors of honor, or when the manola the third and the front
darning bring suit on ownership of the washing.

Furthermore, always reigned there Octavian peace, and it was something to see the friendly frankness
with the esterero I borrowed a pan to the left neighbor and intimate confidence that they
talked in the fifth soldier and the cobbler's wife. Entwined around windows with others, by way
of telegraph circuits, several strings of which hung a few squandered shirts, and from time
to time as is slice of beef, over which descended into silence of the night a cane with a hook,
run by the capable hands of the student's garret.

The window of the room never opened Clara. Elijah had stuck inside from who occupied the house.

If
the outlook was bleak patio, inside the room was undoubtedly certain
charm, not because he had beautiful things, but for simplicity and
modesty reigned there, and the careful cleaning and care, unique elegance
of the poor.

Could be seen, first term, a comfortable voluminous, consisting of six large drawers with carvings
next to the locks, and some slightly corroded scale, over decorative furniture quite old, representing
a Grim Reaper figure with one hand raised in attitude to hold something,
but instead of the clock that once loaded, holding time Clara a box
lined with colored paper, which was to save women's work utensils.

Instead of the glass vial, this hid a piece of gauze and tied with blue ribbons to the legs of
the goddess, which he held in his chest lay a scapular of the Virgin del Carmen.

A dressing table, three chairs, old walnut tree, heavy and shiny, a bristling fit pads needles
and pins, sidewalk and mahogany bed very voluminous architecture,
covered with Palencia blanket, completed the outfit.

Clara was in front of her mirror, and was busy becoming entangled in a thick braid crown black
hair, newly woven and finished in the lead with a bundle of the hair and a red ribbon. Two rows of
small curls, locks subtle, twisted with negligence, I decorated the
front, and white temples, as the line slightly transparent skin blue
of a vein, fell two graceful tufts.

There are no more proper attitude to properly assess academic forms of a woman who that it
takes when it reaches out and wraps a braid on her head, exposing her breast, the waist, neck
in all its fullness. Ti√©ndense chest muscles, it outlines the back, and the angle of the elbow
and shoulder soft curves described in its expansion funny smooth lines that give expression
to the whole figure sculpture.

After the combing operation, Clara cast a look of desire and distrust to the last the huge comfortable
drawer where he had his clothes. It was there, kept with singular care, a suit that Elijah had
bought some years ago when it was less grim and grumpy. This suit, which was the most luxurious
and beautiful that the orphan had, had the shape and most fashionable colors at that time: a black
velvet body with neat drawings trimmings and straw-guard silk, adorned
with a big band, as to third, from black lace.

He doubted whether out or not: I wanted to wear it, and afraid to
put it, wanted to wear that day her best dress, and feared at the
same time be too cute with it.

Why? And pensive and sad stopped, not daring to bring to public light so long that treasure hidden.
Why? Because Elijah had become so irksome (so she said), was so both manic and scolded her for no
reason ... What uniqueness!

The previous week was sewing and fixing the border of the dress that
was broken when the man came, and suddenly said

- What are you doing
...?

Always thinking componerte. Why should you participate in such trifles?

She, truth be told, but had a reasonable answer to give to that question,
dared not, and sadly folding his work, he went to bury her in the
chest.

Elijah softened for this proof of submission, and more bitter and
harsh tone he said to see her pull the drawer:

- When you say you've
ruined ....

But this was not the worst thing you heard the little
girl while in shame, returned to plunder the tomb that he had wanted
to desecrate taking it out of this venerable asylum.

It was not this is the worst thing he heard, because the old man, lowering his voice as if talking
to himself, said:

- At last I have to make a determination with you.

Jesus, saints in heaven! What determination is that! ... If you also want the old to enclose it
in the same drawer as a pledge never worn! ...

The determination that had worried many days. He tried in vain to fathom the mind the old. Ay! But
if she did not know anyone minds poll ... The only way that would was worth to find out just
ask, and he does not dare.

There was more. For the sad street Good God used to spend a flower girl, who in your basket had
some bunches of carnations, two dozen roses and many, many violets. Clara watched through the glass
to the passage of those cool colors that attracted the soul, those
who longed sucking sweet scents from the balcony.

One day he decided to buy flowers, and Pascuala commanded by them. Clara took them, kissed
a thousand times, I put water the stroked, put them in the breast, head and could not help but
look in the mirror that dress, put them back in the water, and finally,
the left still on a vase, who had the impudence to place where Coletilla
put his stick and hat when he arrived the street.

Oh! No doubt he, on entering, was to put happy seeing the flowers.
Flowers I would like very much.

What would surprise! ... This she thought. Definitely was a fool.

The fan came and approached the table, but to put his hat on it, hit
it with the glass, which fell to the ground, dropping flowers and
pouring water on the same legs realistic.

The man was furious, and looked with fury to the orphan, she was trembling,
he shouted:

- What flowers are these?

Who sent you buy these flowers? Clara, what delusions are these? Flirt! There is no remedy.
You've spoiled. Do you also want to fill with flowers the house?

Clara wanted to answer, but even did his best, did not answer. Elijah trampled flowers with fury.

-
I am determined to make the determination.

Again the determination, that determination would be what? Clara thought at the height of confusion
and fear. Then retreat to her room, thought the same, and said to himself: "Will you kill me?"

Could
not sleep that night. At about noon that Elijah felt walking in his room with more turmoil than
usual. So I thought I heard some words that should not be anything good. Clara got up very
quietly moved by curiosity, and little by little came very cautiously to the door to the room
of Elijah, and looked through the keyhole. Elias gestured marching: suddenly stopped, he approached
a drawer and pulled out a knife very big, very big and very sharp, bright and fine. I was
looking at the light, examining it, then him again to save. Clara, seeing this, was to faint.
He retired to his room and went to bed shaking, wrapping up well. Since the night he spent
in the garret of Dona Anxieties in the company of mice, had no fear
alike.

At dawn he fell asleep a bit, but in his dream he had many knives
as he had seen, and sometimes just one, but so great, that would be
sufficient by itself to curtail fifty heads at once.

Arrop√°base more at every moment, believing in the errors of the dream that the knife, notwithstanding
of a sharp-edged and brilliant, could not penetrate the sheets.

The next day he calmed down, and then laughed that Elijah may have been feared killed.

Pore, however, did not dare to wear the suit. Beautiful garment that was sinful of sleep the sleep
of eternity in the depths of the dresser, where serious food for worms.

Clara could not determine in their understanding what she could be of coming of Lazarus. In
his great joy he saw in that more than a happy event, not stopping to consider the events that
subsequently could be derived from that destination. Some vague ideas that feeling accompanied
only expansive and disinterested. He would a young man of position. Why not? No reason in the
middle, Clara thought a change of luck. Somehow, were united in their understanding and confusion
inseparable the idea of ??arrival Lazarus and the idea of ??emancipating a bit of nagging
(not otherwise qualified) tutelage of Don Elias. Into his mind came the idea of ??marriage.
Wine, yes, several times, but almost idea was not that: it was a
confused perception, as a shy and wary hope.

For Finally, and came to think, to really think about this. A confused perception, we said, themselves,
this perception is constantly occupied. Lazarus was going to be her
husband.

Clara also knew see the future days, and saw her husband beside her
in a place that was not in a house that was not it, elsewhere, in
another land.

And in another world, why not? This have been the most successful ...

That day was very cheerful, laughed at the slightest cause, no reason was blushing, he was restless
and restless, thoughtful stayed a long while, and then seemed to talk herself.

Pascuala nine o'clock when he returned from the street and entered
the room of Clara.

Pascuala was a woman who was at his side the most violent contrast
that can exist between two copies of the human family.

It was a vigorous and manly girl, grazed in the fields Alcarrian, high chest, wide hips, red
cheeks, large mouth, nose girl, face narrow, hair pulled back in a big bow, brightly colored,
heavy hands, large black eyes.

He approached the young and mysteriously said:

- Do you know what
I have wrong?

- What? - Ciara said alarmed.

- I've seen the melitarito
the other day, which was here when the Lord came bad.

- So what?

-
What?

Nothing but asustao me because I said I wanted to go, and as we are alone I thought something
would happen to me ... because as well as a nice weekend .... And not a bad face .... You see.

- Ah!

Did the officer that the other day?

... You say you wanted to put here?

- Yes, and then I asked for you.

- Why me? What did you say?

- That was Guen. Then he said that if he was here the old man. You see how little respect. The
old! What disrespect!

I told him no. He told me he wanted to get to talk to me ... But
we ... I'm too sly, and I maliciously ....

- What?

- I do not cheat
so with little words.

How is such a nice weekend ....

- Do not worry - Clara laughing .-- It is said he loves you and wants
to marry you.

If you know the bartender ....

- My Pascual?

I do not know ... If you get to know my Pascual is a gentleman who says chicoleos Pascuala to
....

We note that this mop was to groom a Pascual who had founded no less than a Street tavern Shrine.
Those relationships seemed very honest and noble efforts marriage,
and as she was so very nice weekend, that he would likely pair Easter
is joined to the Church to give children the world and water to wine.

-
For as Easter gets to know ....

- But I'm very naughty ... and has
put me in the head ... Do you know what I have been on his head?

-
What?

- That he does not want to come here by me but by you.

- Why
me?

Do not be silly - said Clara, laughing in the most natural.

- Would you let them in?

- No, look out.

By God, do not do that.

Do not come back to talk more.

What has to come here this gentleman?

- I maliciously ... although
one is so very nice weekend .... Malice I do not want me to me pa
God damn thing ... because in the end, always a servant and he is
a gentleman .... Well seems very prominent person.

Say ... Would you let them in?

- Jesus, Pascuala, not to say it again! - Seriously cried Clara .-- But what you get this gentleman
here?

- Here, to see you.

- And why you see me?

- Here, to view it.

- What an idea! - Murmured thoughtfully.

In this he felt a bell. Coletilla opened and entered.

The two girls continued their conversation on the street when they heard the sound of excited
voices, some screaming and hurried footsteps.

Asom√°ronse the three, and saw that ran several groups down the street. The most famous neighborhood
sparklers left their irons and went in search of adventures.

Glanced tagline of rancorous contempt for pedestrians, and closing heavily to the balcony,
he said;

- Another coup!

The two girls shook remembering the fear that they had a few nights earlier.

- Oh, when will these things! - Observed Clara.

- Pronto! - Said
the old man dryly, sitting up and taking a letter on the table.

Read it, then took his coat and hat, and said to the girls:

- I'm going to go out, I have to do: not come back all afternoon. My nephew arrive tonight
to about eight, I will not come until ten at the earliest. I wait here.

And wrapped in his cloak, he looked a sad watch, compass had sad life the headwall of the room.

-
Do not open any one: careful, careful with the door. Throw all the locks. When you come my nephew,
give him something to eat and I wait.

- But how you going to go out with these riots? - Clara said with fear you .-- Do not leave us
alone: ??we have much fear.

- To me what I have to do to me?

Woe to them! - Murmured furor drowned .-- Beware I repeat the door.

And then, as if to himself, said softly:

- Yes, it is necessary to make a determination ... good determination.

Clara could hear him, and thought of the comfortable in the dress, the flowers, the knife and
the determination, that determination damn did not know.

But even so, that was downcast and melancholy for a while, it was not enough to take away the happiness
that days overflowed in his soul.

CHAPTER IX

# # The first steps.

Street groups grow. The people all had this strange and messy is not uproar, but what precedes
it.

It was the September 18, 1821.

Most the inhabitants of Madrid were on the street. The anxious what's up? out of all mouths. On such occasions
enough to stand two to go then adhering other to form a thick group. Then all who see us look
bad sides.

The most curious incident in those days is offered by the arrival
of the person who is supposed aware of what is going to be.

Rod√©anle: the request is made aware, begins to speak symbolic language to raise curiosity, base
feel that without the deepest discretion and the promise of secrecy
can not say what he knows.

All you swear by the most sacred to keep the secret, and, finally, begins to tell the thing very
dark; excited by the listeners, it was decided to be clear, and they
fit three or four balls of temptation stiff, the others are swallowed
eagerly, then disbanded to go throw up in other groups: are indigestible
as this kind of secrets.

The evening to which we refer was true what happened to our friend Calleja, aware Fontana officer,
had one of the groups formed in the Carrera.

- Why, do not you know? - Said, lowering his voice and making a gesture worthy of the only Spartan,
escaped at Thermopylae, brought to Athens the news of this catastrophe memorable .-- Do not you
know? There is no more but that tomorrow will be a civic procession in honor Irrigation, whose
portrait will be paraded through the streets of the Court.

- Well, well - one of the listeners said .-- Were we to allow it to be mistreated the hero of
Cabezas, founder of the liberties of Spain?

- So how bad is that the Government is determined that no procession. But it is actually decided.
La Fontana has been resolved and will: the portrait is ready. And indeed there is a nice work,
is represented in uniform, and the book of the Constitution in hand. Great portrait! As it
did my cousin, who painted the coffee sample Vicentini.

- And the Government prohibits the party?

- Yes: does not like these things. But there are no Spanish or procession. The Government forbids
it.

Indeed, at that time received a plaster corners official in the camp that read prohibiting the
feast prepared by the clubs for the next day. The troops were on weapons.

- And tonight we have a great session in Fontana.

- Look, Perico, save me a good place tonight - said a young man who was part of the group; - save
me a job, I have to go tonight to the hostel early to receive a Hole
friends from Zaragoza.

And then he added mysteriously, turning to
two or three that seemed to his friends:

- Good guys these kids in
Zaragoza, that I have spoken. Arrive tonight. Are the Republican club
there. Good guys.

The group broke up, at the same time, the sinister
figure of Tres Pesetas crossed the street, attached to the equally
unpleasant to vest.

Left three young group of those who spoke earlier.
There were three young men as twenty-five years. We can not call them
dandies net but could not be said them lacked any distinction and
elegance. They were close friends who shared his hardships and joys,
the hardships of poverty and student loa pleasures of popular aura,
conquered with newspaper articles and speeches in the club.

One was
a young man of distinguished family, second son, whom he had sent
to study Canons and sacred theology at Salamanca, in order to become
a priest and enjoy a fat chaplains who had belonged to an uncle, cantor
of the cathedral of Calahorra. Chaplain you see my eyes, how to have
a bishop in his fist. Indeed: Javier, that was his name The boy had
been a bishop, because his family had great influence. But the boy,
habits did not love and was impressed by new ideas, he made his bundle,
and lacking of money, but not daring, set off, and stood in the same
blessed Madrid year 1820. Wandered the streets alone, but soon had
many friends, wrote to his grandmother, half gave him forgiveness
and some rooms (few, for the family, although the most Leonese noble
land, was in a very precarious situation) then went to Zaragoza, where
he lived for several months, appearing a lot in the democratic clubs,
and later returned to the Court, not very well eaten or drunk, but
happy too much. Writing in El Universal furious articles, and content
with his bit of glory, life was passing, poor but well cyst. Captivates
everyone for the kindness of his character and generous feelings.
In politics professed very radical views, and belonged to the fraction
then called exalted.

At the same militant the second of these three
friends are describing, which was Andalusian of twenty-three years
old, slim, small and flexible. In Ecija, his homeland, he spent his
time writing verbs to Marica, Ramona, at Paca, to the fountain, to
the moon and to all. But all reason, and poetry to dry is more entertaining
than: one day he found boring and thought out of town. Passed by the
army at the time of Irrigation, and the troops excited his curiosity.

Asked,
they said they were the soldiers of freedom, and it rang in his ears
with some nice harmony. "I'm going with them," he said to his parents.
These were very poor, and answered: "Son, go with God, and He makes
you happy and good, behave yourself, and do not forget us."

The poet
followed the army crying his parents, yet it is known that he secretly
mourned three of the prettiest girls Ecija
