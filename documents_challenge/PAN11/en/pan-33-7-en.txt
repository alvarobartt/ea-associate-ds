 And the chiefs left their lords meeting
and were do Inca Yupanqui was, which told him what had made and ordered ANSI, as [to] they had
orders and notices, and that pointing out the sites and places do had deposits to be made because
each of them had to do, and among them the spread had. And then they said some Inca Yupanqui
sheet [40] and mountain slopes that around the city of Cuzco are and the sight of him, and there
were then ordered them built of such deposits, so that, when this was brought proveimiento,
found what you get. And then there were the gentlemen to the sites by the Inca were identified
and put to work and building of such deposits. And tardóse to make and distribute these deposits
land five years, because they were so many shells they did, which sent to Inca Yupanqui, having plenty
of food and so they do not need. And by it craves food had, wanted to build the city of Cuzco in
stone and repair streams the hedge, and had in itself, rather than having supplies in such quantity
that you are missing, I could take the people he wanted [to] make and construct the buildings and
houses ANSI wanted to rebuild.

And the deposits made and provided, and now the land spread and finished
sharing, Inca Yupanqui ordered together the chiefs and gentlemen,
in what has been said, he had made service, and thinking that was
just off making some grants and some contentment dalles, ANSI and
being together, and gave them repartióles many gold and silver jewelry
that by the time in the play were the styling had commanded, and gave
each ansímismo two dresses the clothes of their garments, and to each
of them a woman gave them natives of Cuzco, his lineage, so that each
one of these women were principal chief whom he had ANSI given that
the children é in such had, were heirs of such states and chiefdoms
that their parents had, on the basis Inca Yupanqui by the debtor that
had them in this way, none of them ever in your days you rebel, you
would have between them é é of Cuzco perpetual friendship and confederacy.

All of which ANSI done and seen major injuries chiefs [41] that made them, all bowed to kiss her
feet and he will give great graces. Á which Inca Yupanqui ordered that they should go to rest
their lands, and from then to one year returned to the city of Cuzco, é that at this time, each
of them in their land hiciesen planting many crops of all meals, because I had to would need, in
time: and commended them on their land no idleness hobiese in the young men and women, because
they were not such idleness causes have the remnants of his bad example attempting to execute
[exercise] every time they did not understand to make crops, in matters of war, that [and in]
such exercises as was to know wielding slingshots, throwing arrows, axes to play with how to fight
in battle brandishing spears with shields in their hands, all of which had to do on their land the
young men making a rope to put as many as another. All of which is heard by the chiefs, said
would do so and that was saying it was good. And thus the Inca them away, and them, making
their compliance, they came and went.

Gone were the chiefs to their land, that year that these chiefs had tare on their land and Inca
Yupanqui, by this time, not having to do he took to exercise going to hunt, which made the most
of the day, and other days they walked through the city looking and the site of it, imagining him
in the order itself was to give him and the building and rebuilding that she intended to do,
as he saw that these two streams that the city took in the middle they were great harm in it, for,
as the rains should come every year, they came from Avenue, é should come as Ansi always ate
the earth and were expanding and getting by the city, and via that it was detrimental to the
city and to the inhabitants of it, and to make their buildings and houses that she thought building,
which needed repair first the fervor of those two streams, and they repaired everything could
build any building without fear that such avenues they are dull.

And the year to compliment Inca Yupanqui seemed that it was time that these gentlemen neighboring
towns should come, inviolate his messengers, for which they shipped to say that it was time for should
come to the city, as he had told them when there were, and that a favorable answer "Likewise all the
more cattle they could, é é meals maintenance, it was now the time come Dell and dello TERNIA need.
All of which is heard by the chiefs, as they had ansímismo in care as well send them when from
is left, then went their way; because they already had with all those necessary to bring it,
and so they were already under way; with all parties and which came into the city of Cuzco and
they brought him all the more people who could.

É arrivals were to the city of Cuzco, the Inca made their compliance in this way, because this was
the style that I had when I was in front of Vian, that like in front
of were, raised their hands and faces to the sun, making your mochas
é compliance, then "Likewise é made them no less to the Inca, and
the words ANSI ANSI told when they greeted him, that told him: "Ah,
son of the sun loving and friendly to the poor!"

That said, brought them before his mind craves brought him, then he sacrificed certain é é sheep
lambs before é Dél compliance with all respect, as a son of the sun, and this ANSI fact, the
Inca used to say hello telling them they were welcome, and asked if we were good and that if they
were "Likewise their land. All of which you have heard these guys did with Inca Yupanqui caciques,
when they were in front of him, and he said ansímismo what you heard. É told them that should
give wore those eager lords of Cuzco to those who were there, and so he was left do the Inca was,
and they and those lords of Cuzco were do the deposits were placed é wore all maintenance to
be collected.

And after having loose with the Inca and the lords of Cuzco five days, at their parties é rejoicing,
Inca Yupanqui told them what he planned to do, and wanted to repair é é fortalescer indeed those
of these two streams that passed through the city, telling them the damage rescebia the city, and
they said orchestra ready to do everything that he they were commanded to tell them how quen
It had to have, because it would provide what to do if necessary. And ANSI, Inca Yupanqui pointed
out to them the sources of the streams, and from him to where he paresció who were to begin
such fortifications and repairs, to the junction of the two streams, which is the pinnacle of the
city do they call Pumachupa [Pumapchupan], which says "cola de leon" [42]: and from there sent to
the strengthening and repair Muyna came up [43], four leagues from this city parks. Messrs.
chiefs and ANSI medieron cords with space had since the beginning of where Inca Yupanqui [said]
they started, to the junction of the streams, and so he measured, and divided the party to each
ANSI Cabia the building had to do, and this fact, he commanded them to do Inca Yupanqui bring a
lot of rough stone, because of rough stone was to be the repairs,
and the mixture had to get between the stones, who would look that
was to be a sticky mud, which and that water will get wet, do not
remove it, and before the stones were grasped a other and the water
not just eat the mix.

And thus, the chiefs gave the order to seek é é mud mixture may bring rough stone was sent craves
them all, which brought ANSI, began their building. É é ordered that this building came to Muyna
strengthening [44]; because, as was repaired this stream of the city below, where the lands
and cultivated fields were, and the rains should come to the these avenues, the stream does
not break down the canyons é be entered by land and me a bad and damage to such crops.

And this fact é provided, sent to the lords of Cuzco that some day they wanted to communicate
a certain thing was proper long for the good of the city and the republic, to whom said, as
ANSI and were together, he had great need of clothes made deposits quantity, and for that I wanted
to make a big feast to the chiefs, in which party they were happy when he saw that it wanted to
say and they did send you crave it é proveyesen of their land. É lords said it was something very convenient
and well agreed, they wanted to give orders and command that they should do a lot of chicha,
and this fact é dressed, hiciéronselo know the Inca, who, as he knew that every fact was, said
another day I wanted to start the party, and so he summoned all those chiefs Lord, and being
front of him, told how he wanted idling é rejoice with them, and they received great favor.

É
next morning brought a lot of rushes and was thrown across the square and brought many branches
that rammed into it, in which branches were hung many flowers and many birds live; and so he,
the lords of Cuzco went very well dressed in the clothes that they cherished had, and the Inca
together with them: and they came ansímismo chiefs, who wore dresses the dresses that the Inca
would give them.

É then were taken to the place where a lot of very large number of
jugs of chicha, and then ladies came, longing for women and other
major Inca, which took many different dishes: and then sat down to
eat all, and after eating, they began to drink, and after drinking,
the Inca sent out four drums with gold, and still there in place,
to put mandáronlos stretch in it and then grabbed the hands of all
of them as both a part to another, and playing the drums, for so in
the middle were, began to sing together, starting the ladies sing
and behind them were women; singing in which they said and declared
that the coming Uscovilca had come upon them, and the Viracocha output,
[t how] Inca Yupanqui had him prisoner and killed, saying that the
sun had given favor for it, as his son: and how after he had defeated
and imprisoned ansímismo and dead to the captains who had made the
joint ANSI season.

É Then I began singing, giving praise and thanks to the sun and ansímismo to Inca Yupanqui,
greeting him like a son of the sun, became to sit. É ansímismo began to drink the chicha that
there had, which they say had very much, and in very large numbers. É I was brought there
after a lot of coca é divided between all of them, and this well done, he turned and made up,
as you heard ansímismo, a song and dance.

Which party lasted six [days], in order of which the Inca chiefs told those Gentlemen, that
being the agreement that it Cuzco hobiese clothing stores, wool ANSI and cotton: and that
ansímismo agreement that had deposits of a coarse sisal rugs é thick, with cords to two feet
at the ends of them, with which the tie to their throats as they see the Indians Paresce that
anxiously would give, which had to divide the workers and workers
in the repairs of the work of the streams they went, é them that "Likewise
in the other buildings had to walk, so that in such blankets cabuya
favorable answer would cause the earth é é ANSI stone was needed for
such work, é that as they had these blankets and such, do not spend
their own, which were made of wool é cotton, and the layers with which
they are covered.

All of which is heard by the lords caciques there were Inca Yupanqui said unto them, loose than
happy to do it as ANSI The Inca had commanded him.

É coming out of there, then sent to their lands, villages and provinces: and to have effect this
benefit, then sent on their land were together many women, and placed
in houses and yards, they were spread very thin, wool of different
colors, and that "Likewise were made and assembled many looms, é craves
men and women, with all the more promptly where possible, hiciesen
had clothes that fit them, each by himself, according to the extent
largor and anchor of them was given.

And these clothes made ANSI and finishes, was brought to the city Cuzco: and as there was, the
Inca sent to the chief of which was sent to Cuzco in deposits for such clothing had sent to ANSI.

And
this ANSI fact, the Inca lords é é the other chiefs, went strengthening and repairing these two streams
desto really the city of Cuzco, which already have heard, walking long The agreement was like
them on such workers in the work that went, giving them more quickly they could with all speed
to hiciesen and ends on such repairs and fortifications, in which work spent four years, with
as soon as they could do and finish his work.

Where, as it was finished, the Inca ordered and commanded that they should do another party,
according to the already we have told you, in which party might enjoy della participate and craves
the Lords as the other his subjects, in which party they were thirty days, in which he commanded
to the Inca who later out of the city of Cuzco certain amount of dried apricots, which were the lands
of those gentlemen who were there knew é é fetch him some account what amount had in these lands
and peoples of unmarried girls unmarried and young men, sending the caciques and principal
winters let their butlers, they llactacamayos call that this was his will and command, and that
he then should tell them with all speed should give é account of
such apricots to what is sent to wit, which came back with all speed;
all of which was eagerly dispatched fact é.

É given by the apricots in such towns and provinces account and reason for your request, returned
to the city of Cuzco, where, being before the Inca gave the reason that ANSI had known.

Understood by the Inca and the number of unmarried girls é youths in these villages had é provinces,
sent to these gentlemen, three good friends, who then left for of such towns and provinces, and
to take with all the caciques and gentlemen present there were with him in the presence of which
in each town and province arrived, marry young men from one province to the unmarried girls
of the other, and the unmarried girls the other with the young men of the other, and so he
were doing it for the land and subjective those men with him were chiefs, to grow and multiply
and they had perpetual friends, relatives and fellowship with one another. And this ANSI provided,
the Inca made many and large grants [to] these gentlemen chiefs, giving them many gifts, and
so he was left those lords of Cuzco and the other chiefs, and went
to do what they have heard.

And ANSI, was the Inca city of Cuzco to the same city and with some gentlemen of the peoples
of those around the city are a league, half to é, é less, to which he commanded, é "Likewise the men
of the city of Cuzco, then in front of a favorable answer, a master of those alone, the young
men who craves é unmarried girls in their villages had.
