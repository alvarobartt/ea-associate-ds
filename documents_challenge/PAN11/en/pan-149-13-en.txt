 A bluish cloud crossed the fumes that surrounded the mountain and like a piece
of heaven. She replied: "Yes, but this is a hoax: the sky is closed." I replied: "Soon will open."
Gradually became covered the whole landscape, all colors had disappeared, there were no other colors
than white and the black: the mountains black, leaden water, the silver foam, the gray clouds,
sunrises puffs, puffs pale, iron-colored clouds. She said: "Does not it seem a watercolor?" I approve,
and then I added: "In this there is so much beauty as when the sun shines." I kept talking.
Added an inner light that illuminated my whole life, my eyes no longer saw everywhere else
what forms of beauty. His pale beauty was wonderful at this time, appeared to reflect all the
pale of nature around us. I took her hand. A heat of life transmitted from the hand to my body.
She withdrew, more pale. I said nothing, but the tears rushed to me in the eye. She said:
"You understand that we must part." My answer was: "His will is always fulfilled. If you want,
will depart tomorrow. Wait from afar. And if you want do not wait, do not feed more hope, try to forget.

my pride, my vanity, are to be as you wish ... "Everything had disappeared our view: the whiteness

The veil of mist would evaporate and, as the lake appeared, the foaming
waves that rose and dissolved then, produced the same impression left
by climbing fast, stunning.

A slice of heaven was like a smile. I said, 'Do you see the blue sky ?...Â» She got up.

- What next? - Asked the judge to see that the narrator is silent.

do it and stop your story.

- What next?

Tell me everything must say it all!

- She talked about the other.

I knew it was not love, but the duty that bound him to it.

On rising he said these words: "I do not deserve your love. I applaud the sincerity and I demand
to others I've missed me. You know, and I've said, I am not free ... But the man with whom I had
