 No one could walk around the ship without being jostled by people hits
chairs moved around, or feet entangled in the piles of fabric. Fernando took refuge at the end
of the ride was on the bow, leaning on the railing along the drums and brass instruments left
behind by the musicians.

Stood in the background the island of volcanic mountains staggering, with squares of land dotted
with white houses cultivated. At the bottom, next to the blue sea mass, Spanish fortifications
stretching his old strongholds, topped by watchtowers angles rock ledges. The city was pink,
v on it stood the steeples several tile-domed churches. Four towers in the space marked radiographic
the lines of her body almost immaterial, showing the sky through the tight tramaje.

Above the city, on a ridge of the mountain, flying the flag of a modern castle: an elegant hotel
that came to breathe the northern consumptive. Between the spring and liner, a vault of bay space
with flat barges to transport coal abandoned on its mooring and nodding in solitude; vapors of
different flags around agit√°base flanks of the movement of cargo cranes squeaks and tingling
small boats, sailboats green hull, which seemed dead, without a man on deck, tending to space the skeletal
arms of their masts; roar of sirens announced a game close and others warned roars from the bottom
of the immediate horizon arrival Belgian flags on top of a mast were to the mouth of the Congo,
bows English coming from the Cape or twisting course toward the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, ships
of all nationalities marched straight toward the South in search of the coast of Brazil and the
republics of the Plata; helmets five poles resting on pending orders, back China, Hindustan, or
Australia; vapors tricolor flag en route to the ports France's African colonial Spanish schooners
engaged in coastal trade in the archipelago Canary Islands and Morocco scales.

The island, cheerful and lazy in the middle of the crossroads of major
roads leading to Africa and America, this movement seemed impassive
look of world navigation, while provided food for a few hours of carbon
black to smoky agencies, which came and departed without knowing it,
festooned in a rough sea fleet of cacti and aloes; after the volcanic
mountains guarding the coastline, the secret of his hidden tropical
valleys; climbing the sky with a succession of summits on which floated
the white tufts of clouds and boasting about the mass of the peak
of Teide fleeces, a conical cap streaked with snow, which was like
the tassel or button of this vast land skull emerged Ocean.
