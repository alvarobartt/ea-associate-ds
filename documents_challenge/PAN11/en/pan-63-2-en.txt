 And this is what it all boils down to. But with the new look of things, ignored
by the bandits; with a house full of women, and death, with it's entourage of tears and ceremonies
and pathetic accessories, full of herself, what shocks and scandals and desecration and sacrilege would
not produce a battle in the doorway, a dry shot, with it's corresponding blasphemy and wails, and
palpitating bloodied corpses! Finally, if the snowfall didn't fix the conflict, there was enough
to confuse me and accept for sane and resigned the grey woman in her recent worries. In the
meanwhile, and this calmed some of my concerns, there were many hours ahead; we would see what
course it would take and how the suggested storm behaved, and what march did my uncle's aggravation
followed in the morning. I was well stocked with arms and munitions; as was Chisco, he lived
at home to my side; and to Chorcos, I would take care of telling him on time so he could stay
up as a lookout with Mr. Celso's grave condition as a pretext. It couldn't stop occurring to
me that, instead of waiting for the robbers by the doorway, we could set up an ambush in the immediate
rocks near it, and shoot them at close range when the three of them got near the door. But this
plan was less "conclusive" than the other, and it was plainly exposed that we could be face to
face with the assailants, even if justice was on our side, according
to all divine and human laws
