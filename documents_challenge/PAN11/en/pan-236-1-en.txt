 But, understand well; if you bring confessor, allowance… let's go, any
stunt that might scare and provoke in his illness a dangerous crisis, I swear, on my mother
and the affection of the woman I love, that I will not treat you as a brother. My discretion
is dependent on your behavior.

We are done! –Everyone shall complete their obligation. --Abur!
--y Pepe, walking on tiptoes went into his room.

Tirso remained alone a while longer in the dining room, pensive and
immobile: the dimming lamp, all of a sudden released two or three
sparks from the wick, which was already dry; the movement of the light
caused the wall to illuminate the shadow of the priest convulsively,
and then he, while trying to see fumbles the door to his bedroom,
lit a candle and, after saying his prayers, he went to bed; but he
took a long time to fall asleep.

His brother’s energy had left him completely puzzled. Pepe was more man than he imagined. The
following morning, Dona Manuela, before going on errands, as was her custom, went to give Pepe a kiss,
while he finished dressing before leaving for work. –I’m going
to run errands; goodbye son. –And to mass, right mama? She, smiling
kindly, limited her response to saying: --What bad is in that? --In
that, nothing; but, listen, mama.

Last night, I had a discussion with Tirso, it had to happen and it
did.

I suppose
he has spoken to you of certain projects that he intends to pursue,
relative to our dad; well imagine the results they will have.

Contain my
brother, impose sanity because I am open to anything.
