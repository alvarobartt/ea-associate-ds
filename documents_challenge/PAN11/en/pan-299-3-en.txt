 Not all weapons were destroyed by "black lightning."
It was so great war material, which remained intact large quantities in many towns in the Republic.
These guns, rifles, machine guns and other deadly tools, as well as huge piles of shells,
are stored in the vast historical cabinets universities, and only we know them.

Some timid leaders spoke several times to destroy all this, but withdrew at last, thinking that
going after fifty years and the explosion and deactivation of such materials serve to arouse
the curiosity of people now who have no idea of ??its existence.
