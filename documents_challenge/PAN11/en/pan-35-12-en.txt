 Your behavior
depends on my prudence. We finished!

- Everyone will meet its obligation.

- Abur! - And Pepe, walking on tiptoe, got into his room.

Tirso a while he stood alone in the room, pensive and motionless: the lamp, expiring, dismissed
Suddenly two or three sparks of the wick, and dry, the quake caused light on the wall convulsively
shaking it in the shadow of the priest, and then he, looking almost
felt for the door of her bedroom, lit a candle and, after praying
their prayers, lay down, but took a long time sleep.

The energy of his brother had completely baffled: Pepe was a better man than he imagined.

The
next morning, Dona Manuela, before going shopping, as usual, went
for a Pepe kiss, as he had dressed to leave for work.

- I'm going
to buy, bye, son.

- And to Mass, right, Mom?

She, smiling warmly, saying only:

- What's wrong with that?

- In that, nothing, but, hey, mama. Last night I had one clinging to Tirso, the thing had to happen,
and came.

I suppose you will have spoken of certain projects that attempted, on dad, you imagine the
effect produced. Told my brother, imponle sanity, because I am willing everything.

Tirso not fulfilled their threats, nor be altered again by then, the
quiet of the house; but both brothers realized that this quiet, violent
energy obtained by one and the apparent submission of another, was
not lasting peace, but a temporary truce.

servers? I, however, will not forgive you your lack of candor
