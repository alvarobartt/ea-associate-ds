 

The Princess awoke, rubbed his eyes, sat up and said:

- Have they become the seven sages who were the country knows?

- Not so, replied the girl, who brings the news is one of the lavanderillas
that watery tissue washed VA

- Then make it into the spot.

Entered the lavanderilla, which was already behind a door waiting for permission, and began to
refer with great punctuality and removed as it had happened.

Upon hearing the appearance of the green bird, the princess filled with joy, and listening to his
departure Water turned into beautiful Prince, reddened like scarlet, a loving heavenly smile
wandered over his lips, and softly closed his eyes to refocus her own and see the Prince in
the eyes of the soul. Finally, knowing the high regard, reverence and affection that the Prince
had him, and love and care that kept the three stolen items on the
beautiful box of your entertainment, the Princess, despite their modesty,
could not contain himself, he hugged and kissed the lavanderilla and
the maid, and made other ends no less excusable, innocent and delicate.

-
Now, he said, that I can call themselves Princess Venturosa.

This fad of owning green bird was not fancy, it was love. It was and is a love, that hidden and
not used way, has entered my heart. I have not seen the Prince, and I think it's beautiful. I
have not spoken, and I presume that it is discreet.
