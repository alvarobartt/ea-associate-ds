the image of a man who had been together and he Dona Sol.

- What Plumitas? Nah, you Remember that poor? ... He was killed. I do not know if it Nah, you
know.

Dona Sol also vaguely remember this. Perhaps he had read in newspapers Paris, who spoke much

- A poor
man - "Dona Sol with indifference -.

I just remember him as a farmer boorish and uninteresting. From a distance you see things

Gallardo also had memory of this event. Plumitas Poor!

With what emotion was saved a flower offered by Dona Sol! ... Because she had given a flower
to say goodbye bandit it ... Do not you remember ?....

Dona Sol's eyes showed a sincere astonishment.

- Are you sure? - Asked -. Is it true? I swear that I do not remember anything ... Ay, the land
of sunshine! The intoxication of the picturesque! The nonsense that does! ...

His exclamations showed true repentance. Then he laughed.

- And it's easy to keep it that poor laborer flower until the last moment, right, Gallardo?
Do not tell me you do not. He would not have given a flower in her

as a reminder that no mysterious has been explained ... Do not you
know anything about this, Gallardo? Do not say anything in the papers?
... Shut up, do not say no, not my dreams fade. So it must be: I want
to do so. Poor Feathers! How interesting! And I had forgotten what
the flower! ... I will tell my friend that she would write about things
of Spain.
