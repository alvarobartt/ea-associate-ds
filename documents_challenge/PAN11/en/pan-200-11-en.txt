 And thus this lord Inca Yupanqui took this benefit and provision, until
the Indians were subjective input of the Spanish in these realms, with which this entry was lost
é CEBS.

Inca Yupanqui finish provide the order that was to take the city proveimiento of Cuzco and his country,
became lords his three good friends who craves had sent singles to marry, as history has told
you: and when he is in Cuzco these gentlemen é others in the city were Inca Yupanqui ordered
that all came together in her house other tomorrow, because I wanted to communicate with them
certain party, which wanted to party hiciese each year in the sun for the victory had given him
and made him Lord, and for on this holiday have memory, I wanted to be in it some thing there with
them on its board would communicate. And next morning these gentlemen gathered in the homes
of the Inca, who contacted them the party that yearns wanted to do: and for hobiese della memory
forever, he said to Inca Yupanqui I wanted it in this party hiciesen the apricots with certain
ceremonies and fasts, because such a thing than that, it was a sign and logo for the whole
dende meet a man earth were the lowest to the highest of the city by such masters and children
of the sun, because it seemed that from then on, had to be taken é respected the people of that
city by the city-wide [46] and more land that had been so there: and that it had to be called
the children of the sun, I wanted them to be made and ordered apricots at the celebration of
the sun with many ceremonies é fasts, because those who had been apricots made there, they and
their parents each and ears pierced when they wanted And well I was, é because that was something
that so easily was due to do so had already said, it seemed that it was good to have such order
and ceremonies in as follows: That came together the relatives of the boy who yearns orejon
had to be done, as was natural father of parts of the city of Cuzco and that he and his father
and mother were gentlemen, and if not, what was the father, and if that case had had no father,
that the relatives of his father and closest, and they hiciesen some feast to all other relatives,
and at this event should give order and tell how he wanted to do orejon to such child or debts;
rejoicing them ... [47] that the party that might be found and their prosperity and maintenance
I favor; [t] even if such party which was to make the richest of the bereaved, it was to entrust
to others that he favored his relatives in this party and other subcediesen things he craves, so
craves they had, because they meant to imply, prosperous than they were, had to take a lot
to those who had not so much because, Finally, it could be possible that this is way into
prosperity, which could be lost, and the other had not, therefore, be increased in property
and could help, and for always they had a brotherhood and confederation, was that order and
in that way. É that there Later, the name that other [48] Lord had the nickname that they and
others each nominate him as one talk with him, who appointed him Huaccha ccuyac [49] that
says "love of the poor," [50] [of] which institution, other descendants ANSI is entitled. 

Returning
to the case, said he, that being ANSI time, appointed a day in which day they assembled women
of such heirs of that craves orejon had to be done, and being ANSI time of such women, that
such a favorable answer some parents of young black wool, which were
sufficient for a shirt for her son, and so they brought, the split
between those women and that Another day, at that very site, should
give é hilasen made, and that this young man, that day that the shirt
that is done, start from there in the morning and go fasting in the
field, and take other boys get their own relatives, and he and they
catch each path é bring bales of straw, because them not idle, but
may learn to be aware é tamed, and that if anything it may hath need
of food, they know what it is to walk at work and fasting, and so
he brought this straw, é den distributed among women who have made
t, [t] dende to five days, he returned to join again and make another
party, which party do those women four barrels of corn beer, chicha
jars which are made from that at this event were made, until the entire
sun festival is over, forever quest é Atapas well, which each carry
five pitchers arrobas and from then to five days this boy go to the
hill Guanacaure fasting, going solo, and take another bundle of straw
and hand them women who made him chicha, which waiter, since T is
tile é do, always has to fast until the day you have one to be armed
orejon: and not to eat but regardless of raw corn, and that he do
not eat meat, or salt, or even have to do with women, and dende to
a month I'll start this fast, the relatives will bring such a girl
virgin who is not have known in men, which girl, being ansímismo in
fasting, then a pitcher chicha, which call pitcher calyx [51], and
this girl always walks in the company of these boy in the sacrifices
and fasts that while the party durare [did?], serving, and this chicha
made by this girl, relatives of the novel take it and carry forward,
"Likewise é the girl with him taking that pitcher of chicha called
calyx, and so they will lead to such novel to the huaca of Guanacaure,
which is a league and a half from the city, and a source there is,
relatives to wash their entire body this novel, and after washing
her hair shorn him very tusado, and after tusado, t put it on him
that they did those women First, black wool, and cálcenle shoes made
of straw, which the waiter made being in his fast, so you know, that
if the war and will fail us walk in shoes that the straw to know and
follow the enemy with them, and so they these shoes footwear, put
it in the head with a black ribbon and place it over a deep Desta
white ribbon and tie them around his neck a white blanket to hang
back, which is to be narrower than two feet in width é it takes from
head to foot, and this fact, put it in my hands a bunch of gordor
a straw doll, which ends up carrying straw, according to that born,
and hang it a shot Desta straw long ball of wool, it almost looks
like a snowflake long white hemp, and quest and yearning for it, get
to do the guaca is, é the girl who craves it leads, that pitcher calyx
swells two small glasses of chicha and give them the novel, which
drink one, and the other give it to drink the idol, which poured in
front of.

And this fact, will lower the novel and its relatives as the guaca, and come on to the city and bring
novel that straw, and erect, hands: and being anxiously in the city, the novel wear a T-shirt
colorful and with a white list of bottom-up by the shirt, with some flocadura according to
the top of the shirt, and put it on his head a red ribbon with a list of any color, and ANSI
standard, descapulario put it that way in the back, and from there, go to a morning guaca I
point out, which is called Anaguarque and arrivals there, make their sacrifice by giving some chicha
and before her a fire, fire which offered some coca é corn and tallow: and when anxiously
outside, relatives carried this novel, which sponsors almost want to imitate, some big and tall
halberds of gold and silver and now the sacrifice made, tie at the top, in the irons WITH
THESE halberds, that straw in the eager hands are hanging [of] such iron wool that hangs ANSI
straw, and being tied ANSI and this straw, give each of his novel a halberd WITH THESE in their
hands, and this has already been done, to all these novel júntenlos there shall be found and
send them From there they ran all together with their halberds in their hands, as well ANSI were
following range of enemies, and this is from the guaca run up a hill do it seems this city,
[t] are there in this site, to see true and [safe?] how come these gentlemen novice run, and who
is he that will END the first run, and this honor it as their own and give some thing and say
that he did as good orejon, é Give him Guaman surname, which says "hawk", and these such that
anxiously extremaren when dried apricots were made, are known, when the city of Cuzco hath war,
rise to the Penoles, as lighter, é fight with enemies.

And the next day out of the city, and I point out another guaca ansímismo, which will be called
guaca Yavir, which will be the idol of the grant: and when he is in it, do make a big fire offer
to this guaca é é é sun these sheep lambs, first by slitting their throats, blood which will be
made a mark with great reverence for faces, as it takes to ear to ear, and offer ansímismo to this
fire much corn and coca, which is made all with great reverence and observance, offering the
sun, and asked where these newcomers, é each for himself, which will increase prosperity and their
cattle, and the look and free from any evil comes your way. And it finished, he will be sworn
each for himself, before the idol, ternate always careful to comply with and revere the sun and
worked their land, and be obedient to the Inca and always treat you right and be loyal vassals
and not treat treason é that each and when you know that makes it treason to some Inca, demonstrations
and tell him; é that the same will be loyal to the city of Cuzco, and that each and when the Inca
is at war or the city of Cuzco, who served with his services, and weapons in this war, and who
will die Dell and the Inca defense.

And this jury, the man who abide in the guaca there, before whom the oath so, he will answer
in name and place of the sun and of the idol, who thanks him, and that he craves the right: and that
say that the sun has by property that is auqui [52], which says "gentleman." And this fact, that
such render thanks for this novel around the sun, and then you wear a shirt there too painted
and you put a blanket very painted over, all of which is fine clothes, and hang him ears a large
gold earrings dangling, tied with red thread, and to put a scallop of large golden breasts, and shoes
that fit cattail, put it é head very painted tape, called Pillaca llaut, that you put tape over
Desta a paten of gold, and until there's no waiter may get, and that if that thing be there
forget to put it, was never able to put in their days. And this fact, the market tends arms
to this novel, é those relatives who go there with him as sponsors, getting some stripes on
the arms with a deep, that you remember and has memory The oath that there does and worship
that she was done. And this fact, ANSI fall together to the square of this city, I long dresses
and adorned as we were, where they will find them all the lords of Cuzco dresses a long and colorful
shirts to give them to their feet, which they have on their heads mesmos [skins of lions with
their faces] [53], and the faces desto lions have in film speak [54] of his own, which have lion
heads ansímismo golden ears: and ansímismo have to have these gentlemen get on the square ANSI are
four drums of gold.

É as novices get into the place, get in the wing to the bottom, the faces towards do the sun
rises, and since has looked forward, knelt halberds craves bring on the floor, each one before him.
And as this is done, the gentlemen who are there, begin their singing and touch the drums,
and after having sung and holgádose, sit in a line as long for all are, and drink every two
glasses of chicha and two ansímismo offered to the sun, spilling before their halberds, and dende
little, get up and sing around her, in which song have to give great praise to the sun and
beg his people and to save and increase his novel; and this song
ended, he relapsed into drinking.

And this have to do thirty days from the day you start .-- Y every night in this way are snug
chicha, because their main joy in all their works and things to do, it's okay to drink, and the
more drink, more, sir, because they opportunity to do so.

É ordered these thirty days of age, came together in the square where relatives desto the junior
novels and a favorable answer it there, kneeling E halberd, and when they were in standing,
with hands tomasen the halberd, and so he, stretched out his arms, family members should give them
with a sling on them, that they might report were agreed Desta é party, and that this fact
there were a source to say Calixpucquiu [55], which says "the source of Calix [56] and being
already there, to wash all, to which source they want to go as dark. É ANSI being washed, Hansen
wear other shirts precious, and so they dressed, their relatives stone them with a prickly
pear [57], and every parent, I long as I have stoned with the tunas, they are obliged to provide
such novel certain pieces of jewelry and clothing, and give him ansímismo, desto finally, to
every one of this novel, a sling.

And this is done, every one of these novel must return to his house, whose house is to find very
clean, and very good fire made in it and all their relatives and relatives in it, and then have
to take the four pitchers of chicha they did in the beginning of the feast, which pitchers have
to drink all, and this novel have such imbriagar with chicha so that no [58] makes sense, and
as soon and this longing, hanle to take the room, and where they best they seem good, there
shall bore ears. And tomorrow's another day, go all the novice to the place all together in order
While fighting and ANSI as if to give battle, with their slings in their hands and necks to bags
of networks, which bring many Chinese, and put out as much of a another in the plaza, begin to
battle, which must give battle to the end that they need to understand craves have to fight
with their enemies. In this manner I think it must be these cirimonias, and on this art ordered
triple [in] doing the apricots and not what has been hitherto.

Heard by the Lords what he had ordered Inca Yupanqui, said that was fine ordered and thought, so
there were being put to forward, and to tell them that since when I wanted to begin this party?
He told them that there could be thirty days to begin because that's where do we begin the month
of the year was beginning, and they begged him that because so there had been no order to do knew
the year and the months that had [for good?] signals and the recital of which begun, and the
names of those months. And Ynca I replied that that party after the sun, he had thought of giving
in that order; more, because they invited him to the charms and signs
(and) that he wanted to do that grace: and that at present there was
no place for them to account for this, because I thought identify
and sort such months in the other parties in that they all rejoice
é hiciesen their sacrifices, that from thence to ten days, I would
say that the order that had to have é parties they were to gay and
sacrifices that had to ANSI.

And that said, out of their agreement he and the other gentlemen, which were each to his inn,
where began to give orders to their parties, which have heard that from then to thirty days
were to start, which thirty days ago, made his party the way they have heard; dende and then
I continued to do in the way and that, until this year we are of fifteen hundred and fifty-one
years .-- The party and the other that the Lord established, although the wish to remove in
this city of Cuzco, the often hidden or secret they do in villages which are surrounding the
city of Cuzco.

After that were the ten days Inca Yupanqui Messrs. said that after those came together with him
again, which together had to tell them the order that they asked ANSI that would make the year
and months and the more parties that they had to have and keep, Inca
Yupanqui told them he had many years he had imagined the months and
time of year, which had found that they were twelve and I did not
think saying a desto twelve months and times thing, but it was good
as were going ANSI and such parties that they had them He was to pose,
but because they had asked, he wanted to ask what (So) and say and
declare the parties and the sacrifices that those months were to ANSI
do, they were attentive and the tomasen firmly in mind, that besides
this, I look forward mesmo I had thought of doing a certain thing
he called Pachaunanchango, which means "knower time "[59] - we can
presume Relox - by which they and their descendants, and they lost
track of the months, you would understand when the time of sowing,
labor é, é dressing their land.

And ANSI, the lords being attentive, Inca Yupanqui said unto them this coming month, in which
have to make the pears, as I have told you, that's where the year begins, we shall call and has
called Pucuy quillaimi [60], which is our December, and January called Coyquis has time, and one
month called Ccollappoccoyquis Hebrero [61] and the March call Pachapoccoyquis [62] and as
of April Ayrihuaquis [63] and the month of May called Aymorayquis Keel [64]. In this month was
ordered é Inca Yupanqui that it should be another party in the sun very solene, in which hiciesen
great sacrifices in order to quel the earth had given them and corn that she had, and that since then
began to fuck their maize, were to begin the party and last until at the end of June, and that
in the month of June, which called Hatun cosqui quillan, than in December last year were ordered
apricots in aquesta party constituted in the month of June, to dress shirts woven of gold and silver
and iridescent feathers, and can not wait posts patens é their feathers and gold bracelets,
saliesen to this feast, and that at this event should give an end to their fasting and sacrifices,
since they were sorted apricots until there had been, and there began to rejoice and celebrate
another constituted craves to be had by Simentera sun, to which party ANSI starting from May
until late June, as we have heard, called and appointed Yahuarincha aymoray [65]. Which sent party
that was done in the square is the agora do espital in Cuzco, which is at the outlet of this
city, do call Rimacpampa, to which party had Messrs. dresses out of the city of a red shirt that gave
up feet, in which party ordered it hiciesen great sacrifices to idols, do they burn many cattle slaughtered
é é é food clothing, and in such guacas were offered many gold and silver jewelry.

As of July was called Cahuarquis [66], which ordered that no party will do him no, most of them
said this month they were to irrigate their land, were to begin é plant their corn and potatoes
and quinoa [67] until the month of September came out é, and August Capacsiquis called [68],
and the month of September called Cituaiquis [69]. This month say that it was Inca Yupanqui hiciesen
two parties, one almost wants to look to which we do in San Juan, because they rise at midnight
and washed until rie day, and have some torches lit, and after being washed, these torches danse
in the back, and throw himself say that any ill health and bad they have. É the other party
is [T] he called the Inca Yupanqui Purappucquiu [70], [é] é ansímismo sent the to do this month,
which he commanded that they should do to the water, the hiciesen E ansímismo sacrifices and these
sacrifices commanded that offered a lot of clothes and sheep and coca, and that in any few
herbs and plants that were in the fields, flowers Dellas favorable answer, all of which commanded
offered the waters in this way: them to take plenty of clothes and cast them in that River of Cuzco
in the do the two rivers meet, that many sheep and a favorable answer ansímismo lamb and to
offer them water, and decapitated in that place do the clothes were cast, and then that would
make a great fire there which burnt these sheep and lambs, the ciniza é of those eager burned,
cast into the water at that very site, and then after that, cast into the river and the flowers
have heard: and after this, he cast them into the water that lot of ground coca é shredded.
