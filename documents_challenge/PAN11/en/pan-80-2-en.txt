 The latter removed them plainly with a kick, Galba was angry and with an
oath, threw a stone at the group and walked away, but not before they had exchanged one or two strips
of yellow rice paper with hieroglyphs and gave Ah-Fe a small package. Abriola Ah-Fe went back
to the solitude of her kitchen and found a child's apron, freshly washed and ironed, on the hem were the
initials CT. The Chinese hid it in a fold of her blouse, and continued washing her dishes in
the sink with a smile of contentment. A few days later, Ah-Fe was
presented to her master.

I do not like Fiddletown, I am very sick so I am leaving.

Galba told her
to go to the devil.

Ah-Fe retired to her room and watched him, determined to implement
her task.

However, before leaving Fiddletown she accidentally met Colonel Roberto
with whom she exchanged incoherent phrased that interested the military
man.

When she finished, the Colonel gave her a letter and a heavy gold
coin.

He told Ah-Fe that he would double the payment if she brings back an
answer. Do you understand? Ah-Fe nodded her head yes.

Another meeting took place between Ah-fe and another gentleman, who
was the young editor of the The Avalanche, a seemingly casual encounter
that had the same results.

However,
I feel myself obligated to say that Ah-Fe quietly broke the sealed
hallmark of both letters, and then trying to read upside down and
sideways, finally divided them and sold them to a yellow brother that
she met on her way.
