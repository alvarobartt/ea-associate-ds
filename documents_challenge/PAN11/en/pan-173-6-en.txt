 This neglect, or better
say contempt, lasted until Viedma was installed in office of Super-intendant of Patagonian establishments.
Since then everything was life and activity, and even had the pain of seeing their efforts
wasted, why not give up hope of enforcing their experience to receive their evidence.

Among the means it proposes, and that we felt were appropriate and practicable, there is one call
the attention of the Government, because it can help to increase resources for the treasury. Viedma
instills in which imitates the egemplo of the Crown of Portugal, which granted licenses no
temporary to established companies, to engage in whaling and wolves on the island Santa Catalina.
The product of this line should be of some importance, if calculated extension with our shores,
and the prodigious abundance of whales.

Also weighs the utility of occupying the island of Choelechel, and to this purpose can not dispense
to transcribe a piece of her memory, in order to admire his foresight. "Taking Choelechel site,
and ensure the passage to the Indians of those nations (Peguenches and Araucanian) are numerous:
we take these enemies to the fields and borders Buenos Aires, and we are preparing to enter the country
and other major projects that can attract Black River by the part of Valdivia. "These wise thoughts
were neglected, and only After half a century, the Lord General ROSAS
has had the glory of realizing them.

Promoted to the government of important provinces of Cochabamba and
Santa Cruz de la Sierra, He wrote that this was succeeded by the superintendent
of his brother D. Patagonia Antonio, it imitated the lively interest
with which it watched the prosperity of those establishments.

Viedma continued to operate his new apartment, and died in Cochabamba
in 1809, leaving their goods to a hospice house for the education
of poor children, and founded another orphan.

These were his services to the Americans turn to venerate his memory.

The original of this memory is preserved in the private archive of
Dr. and Canon D. Lord Saturnine Segurola, who has been generous enough
to cross it for publication.

EXCELLENCY. SIR: -

The great love with which I looked Patagonian establishments through the knowledge that would
taking the advantages that the State could produce, I misted every day more and more to sustain
and encourage it: but neither my constant efforts, or the repeated representations to to see the
relevance of the findings and experiences in the production of their land, were able to counteract
the spirit of opposition pursued them, and finally triumphed this,
leaving them reduced to the extent that today it looks.

However, I hope to be the root arrives to promote how much we have lost in their abandonment,
and to give a true light and knowledge of its great advantages through the garments that adorn
high Excellency, able to restore only a few establishments that can serve as invincible wall
the enemies of the Crown, from security to the capital, to promote his trade, and what is more,
the means to propagate our holy religion, to extend the benefits of redemption to a prodigious
crowd of idolaters, that experience has made me know they are docile, without foolhardiness
and who can promise a rich harvest to the evangelical workers.

But my confidence encouraged to see that after I had the honor of integers to well above VE
the occurrences of these populations, their proportions and utilities, he deserved welcome ear,
we found very addicted and willing to learn all that radically, and
as a subject so vast that he can not rely on verbal reports, and withheld
the news for a perfect knowledge, VE sent me to do it in writing,
for the sake of so superior provision, in relief of my love of the
King's service, and common good of these provinces, I venture, with
the confidence that gives the truth and the good cause, to propose
to your Excellency, that efforts at all times that our Court has been
set in the aforementioned populations coast were born from the illustration
that had the advantages that would bring the state and to Religion,
without having to move from concept, because there is no success corresponded
to how happy the project.

That notwithstanding that the emulation has always been regarded, will be useful, as it is in the
day the promoting livelihood and has been in the Black River, by the prosperity that attracts
and will see, also proposing ways and means to promote it without
squandering the treasury.

                         Three parts make up the plan of this report.

I hope than I can perform to my desires, and as worthy of the importance of the matter!

PART ONE.

Since achieving his dominions Spain to join the vast, fertile and rich kingdom of Peru has always
been the object of the untiring zeal of Kings and Ministers, preserve inviolate his faithful
subjects, and improve the disposition of souls idolaters, to attract our sacred religion. The
achievement of these important and beneficial ideas, with orders and permission of Government,
there have been several expeditions to discover the islands, coasts and ports South Sea and southern
lands. Such were those of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa in the year 1579, from the city or port of
Lima, who made the voyage by sea to the south of North, discovering the islands of the archipelago
Chono, the Strait of Magellan where he crossed, with the ports, bays, inlets, shoals, reefs
and how circumstances offer: for whose plans, relationships, daily news and safe passing the
Strait English privateer, called Francis Drake, the second was determined that rushed in Spain
the year 1580, twenty-three bagels in command of Diego Flores de Valdes, with destination transporting
troops to the kingdom of Chile, for relief of war that was in him, and let in the Strait of
Magellan people going to settle under the direction and control of Sarmiento, which sailed the
following year 1581, the port of San Lucar. And having suffered many losses, delays and arrivals,
by large storms and other setbacks, the end from the river Janeyro Commander resolved with the consent
of the other officers, Diego the Rivera with two ships and three frigates come out for the
Straits with people, food and articles intended to settle. That effect was executed well, and
he went into that place about half a league, 280 people lay on the earth, not wanting to move
forward with loss one of these craft, which could only save the artillery and supplies. All This left
the charge of Sarmiento, and a small bagel, only help to big business;
retiring with the other ships, without having taken another providence
for the promotion and sustenance of those nations.

With so small a population Sarmiento forces formed in the same landing site, and San Felipe another
call at a port hondable little more in the interior of the Strait, the they could not survive
the abandonment with which people looked at that miserable, perishing every one, a soldier named
exepcion Tome Hernandez, a native of Badajoz, which was saved in an English vessel passing
through the Strait to the South Sea. The expedition of the two Nodal brothers who crossed the
Strait: the parents Cardiel, Quiroga and Strobl, with Captain Oliver the year 1746, intended to
recognize, and populate the Bay of San Julian: Commander of the D. Francisco Pando, for the same
awards: the D. Sunday Perler, officer of the same class with his control, called the Chambequin
Andaluz, and lately which have left Montevideo and Buenos Aires, to form populations in the
Bay without Fund or Punta de San Matias, which drains the Black River and St. Julian, from December
of the year past 1778.

He brought to mind these expeditions by the time series in which they occurred, to demonstrate
the efforts of the Crown to set Parages establishments in those deserts.

The short time that I adhered to, so that narrows my trip, I show leaves room large expenditures
that have led to the Crown, and the people who have sacrificed so arduous enterprises. Newspapers,
news relations and give a true idea of ??this assertion. But what we have achieved in such repeated
attempts? What have we got so many expenses and losses so large? - At the present time we can
only say, nothing more than meet our curiosity to cross the threshold
and the way we want to close and defend our enemies, and make it impossible
for the reduction of the heathen souls, which has always been the
largest vigilance of our Catholic and religios√≠simos Monarchs.

Rare disgrace of our nation, so sacred that have similar purposes as a result! Orders and provisions
of the Court have never failed to achieve them: no expense has been spared, even amid the most
dire times that afflicted the Spain: but inconstancy, emulation,
the lack of sincerity and little pain to work on all occasions, have
been some powerful enemies that have marred so heroic enterprises.

For conviction of this truth, we critical facilities and population that formed Sarmiento,
and Rio San Julian and Black. For those left a navy port San Lucar, led by Diego de Flores, 23
ships, and well that not all of it destined to For this purpose, as is sitting, was reinforced
later in the Rio Janeyro with four galleons; and losses caused by storms, could not be allocated
to the egecucion of these stocks more than two ships and three frigates, under the command of
Diego de Rivera. This Captain, as something lost, thrown or landed people going to settle,
within half a league Strait, lost a boat, it leaves more shelter and aid to Sarmiento a small
bagel for the relief of those people in such remote distances and Parag, whose land in a long
time could not produce fruit for their preservation and survival. It back with the other ships,
without repeating the relief memory. With these provisions, So what
were to have those miserable? - Of course.

The loss of all.

Let us now see what was the cause of these misfortunes, and that it breaks so holy an end. "The
futility of such lands, or the bad provisions of Diego Rivera? - It is well implies that the
latter. The land could not produce, nor bear fruit in years people that they might exist,
and for lack of wins, which is the greatest force and soul of populations, and because, to prepare
the land for agricultural work was must observe the time better suited to the fields, and have the
tools and oxen calls for the need. None of this reflects their inconsistency, and the little pain
to work the voyage, which was to be made through the Strait to Lima and to other ports to support,
encourage and ensure populations. Is performed so strange and violent landing: you look with
indifference the King's service, and the remaining state of those
miserable, abusing the loyalty obedience and courage with which despised
death.

What else could make the Court, in an era when Spain was afflicted with the efforts that caused
the willful rebellion of the flamingos, which gears up as respectable navy, and later strengthened
with four galleons? If you have played Diego Rivera their orders with more foresight, with
another baby, or with more humanity, repeating aid with the vessels under his command, those
populations have been set, or at least would not have lost so loyal and unfortunate Spanish,
but their inconsistency, and no suffering to the work, made useless
the efforts of King, and sacrificed to these unhappy.

Although the experience of these events gave to the wise minister, who so glory of the nation
address the monarchy, the light and knowledge, so do not develop so unfortunate end establishments
latter Bottomless Bays and San Julian, no so have been able to free himself from the same contrasts
that finally brought down to a estenuado skeleton of the young population of the Black River.
With such a strong case (though never gave up the intent of these populations), they had indeed
found the King at any cost in both expressed bays. To this end appointed commissioners, and
ordered families from different provinces of Spain, with his real
will, who enlist the most honest, hardworking and better behavior.

Implemented this project with the first expedition that came out of Montevideo, commanding D. John
Stone, was discovered the port of San Jose, where he was made the first provisional establishment,
and the little water they carried vessels, lack of horses, oxen and mules to lead from sources
that were discovered, and poor quality of food supplies, sick people, and missed the record to wait
for relief from the Rio de la Plata or River Black, which was discovered a short time, forcing
the commander most violent terms D. Antonio de Viedma to withdraw
with almost all of the people, to the square of Montevideo, Santa
Teresa in the packet boat.

The opposite event that caused it was the arrival at Buenos Aires D. Basilio Villarino Black River,
where he delivered the Super-intendant D. Francisco de Viedma, to succor the port of San Jos√©,
with a lot of watery which led the brigantine Our Lady of Mount Caramel and Animas, and the loss
of the hooker, call the Visitation, which was to set sail in that bay to drive aid to the San Jos√©:
Well, having achieved any of these relief, has not been rooted with
scurvy killed 28 men had not forsaken that position, and caused the
loss of the effects and there were groceries.

These unfortunate principles generally altered and prevented the spirits
so that nothing has been more odious than Patagonian establishments,
and all have conspired to another purpose to destroy them.

The many jobs that means for setting the San Julian, and encamped at the time the People in Puerto
Deseado, where little perseverance and suffering of the commanding officer the troops, and
counter interim seduced and intimidated the other, in terms to avoid was forced inconveniences
the Super-intendant D. Antonio de Viedma send to disposal of His Excellency. D. Juan Jose de
Vertiz, news and the reasons for this deliberation; and as for the diseases suffered in the port
of San Julian, the homeless, long voyage, salted meat food, and other causes, eventually lifting the
universal outcry against the two establishments, whose continued complaints and sighs opened in the
gracious heart of Mr. Vertiz the gap to their way, for which he came
to occupy √© impress with the same horror.

Although the establishment of Black River was exempt from the calamities suffered by others, for
its excellent water, abundant game, and cattle with which our aid the Indians, it could not
get rid of equal or greater persecution. Since the early reign in the main heads a spirit of
emulation, of volatility, and no suffering to work: for whose concerns were not exempt persons more
characterized, and together they directed their thoughts to move
the minds of other people, to be abandoned office, whose efforts have
always been challenged by the constancy of the Super-intendant.

These first attempts frustrated, seeing that by the superior government of Buenos Aires had supported
and aided the establishment of extreme necessity in which he was, prepared weapons by other means
to destroy them. Many pondered the expenditure involved, the barrenness
of the land, it was only useful in the short and the pieces on the
shore the river running down their innundaciones, not enough to sustain
a population
