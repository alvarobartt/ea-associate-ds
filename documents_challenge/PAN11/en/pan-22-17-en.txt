 As for the French, it is not necessary say that
as we had so many losses. Except for the four ships that were removed with Dumanoir not going to fire
stain in a long time could not shake the Imperial Navy, heroically leading our allies in the
battle. Villeneuve, wishing to forget his faults in a single day, tirelessly fought to the end and
was taken prisoner Gibraltar. Many commanders were captured by the English, and some died. Their
ships the same fate as ours: some retreated to Gravina, others were captured, and many were
lost on the coasts. The Achilles flew in combat, as I indicated in my relationship.

before Trafalgar, Napoleon witnessed in the field of Ulm the parade of the Austrian troops, whose generals
handed him his sword, and two months later, on December 2 of that year, winning in fields
of Austerlitz the most brilliant action of his reign.

ordered the newspapers not to speak of the matter, and when he realized

a great sensation, I felt strong steps in the upper galleries, and had not yet had time saying
a word, when I embrace. I quickly recognize faces Do√±a Flora, more pintorreado day that an
altarpiece, and disfigured with ferocious joy that my presence had on the spirit of the excellent
old. The sweet names of bud, Remon, angel, and others who lavished me with all liberality,
not made me smile. I went and all were in motion. I heard my master say, 'There he is! Thank

"And
D. Rafael? What has become of D. Rafael? "
