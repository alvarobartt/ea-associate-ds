 

The weapons of war canoe is a bronze Cañoncillo a rod or something else long, which promptly fired
several shots. And for this they bear in their drawers well conditioned cartridges, made of
canvas instead camellote because in this way prevent is some fire in the canyon, and say they are
not so hot, although shoot then with that many shots Cañoncillo. The alacrity with which soar,
due partly to have everything ready, and be able to easily handle the gun for being so short,
and partly because those who exercised four well concur in charge: one with the cartridge, other
with the heel and attacked, one with a fuse that sticks in the stove filled with gunpowder not
stopping at prime, and the other end with boot-fire.
