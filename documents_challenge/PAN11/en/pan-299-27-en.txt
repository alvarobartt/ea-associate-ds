her, and showed me several days surly and sullen. I passed me at the desk hours of rest, pretending
to extraordinary occupations, or I would I, as escaped, to wander the plain or lie on the grass
under the trees of river. Several times I caught lady to show me their drawings, and a beautiful
watercolor painted on my gift: a bouquet violets put on a wine glass and took me to go to his
call. For the night, time that we met in the room, I stayed away from Gabriela, leafing through

attack, that the doctor was very alarmed and worried, and that things went wrong, badly.

"I want you here, if a misfortune, to accompany me and help me. Juana does everything. The poor

came to me, and also your friend Don came Quentin.

It's a really good guy. I asked if anything could be useful to me and if I needed anything. I said
no and thanked him.
"We also came PÃ©rez Castro girls, I asked for you and give you charge
me memories of you of your dad. I sympathize these girls, I told you.
