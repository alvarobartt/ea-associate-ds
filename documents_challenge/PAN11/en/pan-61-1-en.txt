 If I am your daughter, if I want so much,
Why do not you come to see me? I warned you to Dolores. Why do not you come out to speak? I have
very angry.

- Ay! cried the black.

Do not tell me this girl is killing me ... His beneficence was not alone.

- No. Went with mom, Carmen, the wife and sister Moya Panchita.

What was so special?

- Pretty girl of my eyes.

- Speak, explain.

-
I can not now, my child.

- What!

You do not think my mom ask his blessing?

- Yes, girl.

I, I want the soul, came ... From the point reached by Ms. de La
Habana, I run and throw myself at your feet ...

- Why have not done
so?

Who has prevented you?

- Miss it.

- Mom? No, it can be.

You are wrong, you dream, Maria de Regla.

- I mistake not, nor sleep, Adelita girl. Hopefully!

Miss has banned your feet on this house.

- How come I do not know about that? Who has been with such a story?

- There was no story, Adelita girl. Dolores told me about a conversation he had with Miss the master
about me ...

- You see? Dolores misunderstood. You mom is not brave. And if not, now I find out.

- Do not do it, girl Adelita, no, for the love of God, "replied the
slave so scared, stopping the girl in a chant of her dress.

By itself, or not, you'd better not see me now Miss. Is there a doctor?

- Well, I want to see you alone. Arrange mode. With Dolores'll let
you know. What do you want Doctor?

- For a tan that have brought
the mountain bitten by dogs.

- Bitten by the dogs! Adela repeated.
Ay! It must be very serious case when they call doctor. If you have
torn! Probably. Those dogs are like beasts. What horror My God! Mateu,
said loudly, looking around him
