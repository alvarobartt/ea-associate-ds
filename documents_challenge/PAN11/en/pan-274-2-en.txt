 I'm leaving Orsel and
never return. Never forget that you were not my best friend, only friend. You're the excuse of my
life. Vouch for it. Goodbye, be happy, and if you talk to your son from me is to not look like

"Oliver."

Around noon it started raining. Domingo retired to his cabinet and I followed. That half-dead a
companion of youth, the one old friend who knew him, had revived bitter memories that were only
waiting for a propitious circumstance to spread. I did not ask confidences, it was he who
gave me those.

And as if it did more than put into words coded reports had in view,
told me without disguise, but not without emotion, the following story:

What
I have to tell me is small, and could be reduced to just a few words:
a farmer who is a moment away from his village, a writer, dissatisfied
with himself renouncing to the hobby of writing, and the roof of the
native house standing on the start and end in its history.

The prosaic ending that you know, is the best result of my story in terms of morality and perhaps
more as an adventure novel. The rest is instructive to anyone, know only shake my memories. I have
not tried to do mystery, believe me, but I talk about it as little as possible for personal reasons
that are nothing like the desire to make me more interesting than I really am.

Several people are mixed on the facts I will refer you: one is a very old friend - hard to
define and even harder to judge without bitterness - which you have just read the letter farewell
and mourning. Never told about a life that could not please him.

Mix in these confidences is almost rehabilitated. Another, I have it refer to it by putting discretion
in my words contained in situations that make him a public man, or known or probably you will get
to know, and I do not diminish in the least merit revealing to you the modesty of his lineage.
