 (Thinking of Fidel). Thanks to the new Legislation, I can see the
outside world for a half-hour every day.

Why has this come to pass?

Indeed, for thirty minutes I may look, but what will I see? A dim light,
her face thickly veiled, in a state of kneeling, eyes fixed on her
book... Rouge Veil! the poor knees of her soul!

Entering from the doorway, Amparo crosses in front without looking
at anyone, eyes staring at the floor.

I exclaim that Amparo knows that his beloved is there and by stealth
he can see her entirely, from head to foot.

Listening Amparo in a state of love, imagines a day of procession an celebration had Fidel in front
of a balcony full of friends, been free for but 3 hours, unveiled,
her gentle body, dressed in light clothes free and unrestrained.

What a transformation!... Fidel happy, playful, generous and fair!

On
her person lay treasures of silver, diamonds, pearls and rubies.

From her came a voice unique and unlike any other person alive.

No one else can put words to the deathless beauty of the Jeweled Princess.
In this It is true Amparo was right. One day, after from tending to
a sick relative with one of his crass brothers, caught a glimpse
of a blurry sight.

Amparo in the muffled dark and silent streets, catches sight of what
looks like Fidel, but in such a place and time the shadows and distance
can distort and trick a man and in Excited eagerness Fidel runs to
light to see clearly and approaching with the light came also the
very real touch.
