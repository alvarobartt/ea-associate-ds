 

With the above I think he left showed that the seduction scene between the Duchess and Ignacio,
far from being sinful is exemplary and uplifting. And let also shown that is not there today
so seductive duchess has increased corruption in a class society than others, and at the present
time in the past. The same corruption appears in time of the Pharaohs and repeated in Phaedra, in
Briolanja and the women empecatadas of which managed to win the three most glorious saints whom
we have cited. Does not imply more corruption, no need to attribute the author of the novel
more pessimistic, so that it justified vengeance by taking the Duchess Ignacio know their shame.
Almost all women of ancient times when they are more fiercely despised retaliate.

    Why poisons introduced If nature
    had Downs to kill?

What
    atrocities and heinous crimes do not make the heroine's devotion
to the Cross, the Catholic playwright irritated by us represents a
contempt not real, but imagined!

Driven by their passion Julia decides to commit and commit such crimes

Will spook the world Admiration of the times Horror at the same sin
And terror of hell.

    
    
    The revenge, then that
    takes the Duchess making Ignacio see his disgrace, is a trifle, is
a bargain when compared to other thousand vendettas, born of grievances
of the sort.
