and we praise and thanks also to other flowing springs, which flow from rocks immediate foot
of the mountain, and several wells and not a few wells of fresh water, with which watered gardens,
planters and flowerbeds.

From between the bars of the gate was in the best houses were the flowery patios, some of which
the orange trees and acacias lend welcome shade. Plants vines climbed

take shelter in their preserves and dark, drinking in their crystal
streams and ditches, and to rejoice that oasis with chirps, trills
and gurgles
