 The
last part of my journey, night and raining, dark corridors of the house, the kitchen so big,
so dark at first, then look strange in light of the huge bonfire fur and things of my uncle, the
woman appeared suddenly gray, the dark moorland dining room, explored the dim light of lantern
four glasses clouded by scab; the silence of "outside" ... worse than silence: a distant sound
and intermittent rough, something which put fear into the valiant Don Quixote chest one night in
near Sierra Morena, and the other silent house stopped talking about My uncle had impressed
me badly.
