of genius. But if not killed, he would know revenge, he was a man and when you come down that lieutenant
and require accountability. Kill him, yes sir, kill him, and then what a scene so tragic!
Lieutenant at his feet, pierced by a sword, Amparo, disheveled, weeping, scolding the sky, and
he stood up as giant ghost, bloody steel in hand, and face a desperate smile, hell, crazy, something
to remind the last act of Don Alvaro. And the poor boy clenched hand pressed to his reed, that
his imagination was "Toledo Steel" and thought wildly in Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Cervantes and
Lord Byron, in all the great men who, in the words of Andresito had had bad fleas, and so giving a

Ballad calm, cheerful and insolent rascals, but see the flaw, bourgeois kind, Reid like chickens
crowed, silly women who are celebrating the contortions of the puppets! All not know that the
volcano roars a few steps from you, not know that there is a man who prepares the most horrible
