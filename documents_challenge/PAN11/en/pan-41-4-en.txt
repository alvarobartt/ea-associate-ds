 

Do√±a Martina laughed loud, crude, which made the eyebrows arching slightly D. Bernardo.

- Do not be V. ever, if God does not put his hand on it, put it hopefully soon!

- Such happiness, he first has to touch me Don Facundo - whispered a hollow voice.

Hojeda looked up confused.

Few things bother him as much as being mentioned in this women's issue: why the rogue colonel's
always did that was chance.

- I !..... Col. ..... V. beg .... marriage .....

- A good portion
goes V., Bembo friend !..... Ojeda is a egoistazo ..... More than
twenty times he I wanted to marry, and have always been jilted the
bride.

- Allow me, Martinita - was quick to say D. Facundo, - I have
not given anyone pumpkins ..... These are serious matters, Martinita
.....

- Hojeda not home - continued the lady, - not to abandon their
selfish bachelor life.

Who robs him of giving short walk in the morning at the retreat, his little sermon in the afternoon
Calatravas or the Incarnation, his bulls or steers on Sundays, etc.., Etc.?

- Let us know what falls within these etcetera, D. Facundo - said the colonel.

Hojeda glared at him, and said nothing.

- But V. is another thing, Colonel V. is a man of the world, less arregladito that Ojeda, and can
make any girl happy.

- I heard V., D. Facundo - said the colonel
.-- Men can not make happy arregladitos girls.

- No, man, no, I mean
that - Dona Martina said laughing ...
