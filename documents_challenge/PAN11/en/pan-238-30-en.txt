A high priest, his face pale and round, still young, with blue eyes and myopic eyes vague, appeared
at the door. All rose. The Marquise de Alcudia proceeded rapidly and to kiss her hand. Behind
her followed suit her daughters, Mariana and the other ladies of
the party.

- Good evening, father -.

Good eyes see you, father -. Sit here, father .-- No, not there, Father, I come near the fire.

The
male was shaking hands with affectionate respect.

The priest's voice, asking or respond in the greetings was soft, almost falsetto, as if in the next
room had a patient, his smile was sad, protective, insinuating.
