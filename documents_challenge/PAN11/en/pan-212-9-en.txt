with an innate elegance that is exuded as a perfume of the same simplicity and modesty of
their dress.

Don Braulio was in his, though clean, fed neglected. His coat and hat were fashion the way for
eight or ten years.

His black tie was a little shabby, and neck shirt, straight and on a large, nearly reached
his ears.
