 Candida dealt with swiftly when off, stepping, for which he had to rise skirts up near
the knee. Was jumping and went to the weight of your foot where the flame was alive, but also
ran the floor shellac liquid hot which is very sticky substance, the soles of the venerable
lady clung so heavily to the floor, I could not, without a medium effort, lifted.

Rosalie went straight to her husband, who, feeling around, grabbed her with anxiety seizure,
and turning his eyes everywhere, seemed to find something that eluded him. His face expressed
terror so intense, that his wife did not remember seeing anything like it.

"What ?...»-- was all her, her dismay, she could say.

Bringas rubbed his eyes, opened them again, and moving much the eyelids,
like poets when they read his poems, said in a tone that tore:

"I
see!

... I see! ".

Rosalie could not add anything, such was his terror.

Garcia the Great, who had mastered fire, but not completely prevent
the adherence of his boots to the floor, went to pitiful group ...

"That
will not be anything" - he said noting that strange look of D. Francisco.

-
Where is the window, the window ?...-- moaned the most desperately
unhappy.

- There, there, you do not see ?...-- Rosalie shouted, turning
toward the light.

- No, I do not see, do not see you, I see nothing
... Complete darkness, absolute ... All black ...

- Ah, that damn
job ... Well I told you, well you said it all ... But it will happen
...

Rosalia was more dead than alive ... Do not think of anything.

The penalty was choking. Candida, proceeding more calmly, he began
to make arrangements.

"Sentémosle on the couch ... Now should call the doctor. "

We approached the sofa and collapsed on him sick with despair, as
if it would drop in his coffin.

Palpable object, felt to his wife, or a point left him.

"Well we told you - he repeated, drowning in tears and hiding the
dissonance of the voice -.

That damn hair piece ... working all day ... If you could feel eyestrain, why Why continue? ".

-
My children, where are they? - Muttered Bringas.

Near the door were Isabelita and Alfonsin, terrified, silent, not
daring to step: the small as the bread for a snack in hand, chewing
slowly, the girl would be, with hands behind his back, watching the
sad group of distraught parents.

Rosalie told them approach. I felt Bringas, diols thousand kisses, lamenting not being able to
see, and predicting that no longer would ever. More tears spilled the poor in that quarter of
an hour in all his previous life, and Pipaón, considering that sudden misfortune that God sent
him, conceptualized punishing the faults he had committed. It was necessary to order out from
there to young. Retaining prudence in Furriel and not let them pass. Inspired Isabelita care
for fear that the strong impression he received a disorder produjese spasmodic more serious than
previous ones. Meanwhile, Mrs. García Grande, most obsequious and helpful with friends at the
critical times, she dedicated her existence to be useful.

"I will go for the doctor. You'll see how this tells us nothing. I had a thing that I learned the
point of Flanders. I suddenly felt a disturbance rare At the hearing,
then I began to see objects halved.

All stood in a sharp pain head. Call that ophthalmic migraine. I remember hearing my doctor
say that in some cases is completely lost sight for a few hours a day ... Serénese you, my friend
D. Francisco, and take a glass of water with a little wine. Back soon.

Came out diligently, with sincere desire to serve, and not finding a doctor who lived in the house
went to get the call. While they were alone, Bringas and his wife
barely spoke.

She could not stop looking at him, hoping that when he least expected it, they gain those astonished
eyes the most precious gift for which they were raised, he began to exercise the sense peculiar
to the blind, touch, and I saw her hands, and shaking it, and palpating loving and carefully. A
single word, sighs and lamentations of the poor sick were the only verbal expression of that
sad scene, the more silent eloquent.

The doctor came at last. Candida, would not let the hand to enter
with him into the house.

It was an old affable, old-school, excellent diagnostician, shy to prescribe and as I said,
unfortunate. Aware of the history of the case, called evil retinal congestion.

"In the retina - supported Candida -.

It happens. Soon regain sight, but the work of hair, buddy, you model terminated. "

- If I say, if I announced - the Bringas said briskly, with the hopes revived giving the doctor -.
And now ...?

The doctor prescribed bed rest, diet, and the next day a derivative. Also ordered black bandage,
a soothing light for in case of insomnia, and offered to come early next morning to examine
the eyes of the patient detention. It was late, and last sunlight was leaving the room gloomily.
When the kindly old man withdrew, Brinker and his wife were more
animated.

"Nothing, my children, not be rushed - they said Candida, both of whose useful informal served
as a great comfort -. Now sleep ... and sleep if you can. Nothing to fear, or think as not to
be. Serenity and a little patience.

It's a matter of hours or a couple of days at most. I undertake to bring medicines and as needed.
Accompany them well all night, if necessary ...».

When the helpful lady came to the pharmacy, Rosalie and her husband
had retired after to sell a large piece of black silk.

Like any fledgling blind, Bringas affected no need of foreign help to undress, and learning about the
distress of his wife, had revive the heroism of loving expressions, as if he were a healthy and
she's sick.

"Probably this will happen ... But it is tiresome. Not a chance I do not like this. Relax,
I'll take it patiently, and very nearly the beginning and to get used ... I am very glad of
not having to call an eye doctor as these, though healed, always cost an arm and a leg. "

The night passed without any notable success, Bringas worried sick with excruciating pain cephalalgic
and eyes, Rosalia awake, sharing their care and monitoring within the blind husband and epileptic
girl, who was rushed to nightmares more alarming than those of ordinary
scenes because of that afternoon vividly excited.

By that of all Candidita accompanied her troubled friend the night, comforting her with his presence
and by paying very effective aid. It was very typical for such cases and knew a thousand little
things medical supplies domestic. In the early settlement was difficult, never be cowed, nor
his drumsticks known bone fatigue.

At dawn, more or less, Rosalia, losing sleep, fell asleep in a chair facing the bed marriage
where Thiers good lay, dormant since, and so was the lady fall drowsiness that it will start to
see the Torres and his famous beard and nose.

Also offered his view the sum, which was in part after part, developing their units on lengthy
space and saw the urgent time that day that dawned threatening ...
Suddenly the wretched Recobrose opening his eyes.

She thought she heard a ay! Rosalia, but his dream must have been
because the holy man seemed calm, measured breath and stated that
at last he fell asleep really.

"Torres ... money! - Rosalie thought, shaking his head to ward off that idea, as if this were a nuisance
to him pose in front -. And under what circumstances, my God !...».

XXI

But almost at once that such said Vinolé quickly thought, as these rays celestial mysticism that
speaks, a saving idea, an easy, efficacious, oh derived oddities of life!, in the same distressing
situation in which the family was. What things does God! He knows why he does them.

Rose from the chair quietly and with great pause to avoid waking the patient. I knew what I had to
do. The thing was clear and easy. What could not be done the day before, would at that as
evil. She had thought several times in the silver candlesticks, but How unselfish commitment
to D. Francisco, a man of such good eye, found out ...?

It could be I could be!

... She would care to replace them in place, bringing together very soon money necessary for
the performance, and so her husband would notice anything when he regained view. Would to God
and St. Lucia this out soon! May not be enough the product of the chandeliers for getting of the
amount he needed, besides money Torres, he needed the second term of Sobrino Hermanos, decided
to unite the above pieces of shiny silver screws that had ears, Augustine donation Caballero. Bringas
could not feel the need, and if by chance noticed by passing the hand through face, she would say
anything, I'd say ...

That they had been taken as a sign of mourning.

Doña

Candida was coming as a template for the credit operation planned. Found her in the dining room,
happy ever after, as savvy, as awake as if I had not had a bad night. Rosalie took the point
chocolate, so your friend hiciese his taste which had drinking.

While a respectable lady took care of this with the thoroughness that always put in such a pleasant
operation, her friend took their projects. Whispers were heard for a while intimate, and saw
himself doing Candida head nod, enough to provide security to the same question.

"Before noon you're all done.

Calm yourself ... For these things I'm worth yo a friend who is a lynx ... Stealth, activity,
understanding, everything is, and dispatches these commissioned by Jesus to say. "

There is reason to believe that by that time, the second stage of
its decline, was beginning Candida to see in person the Monte de Piedad
and lending houses, either for business their own convenience, either
to provide a sensitive service to any friend of many confidence.

This Maximo Manso called the second way to Dona Candida, and I note There was still a third way
much more pathetic.

Everything was arranged, then, that morning so easily and quickly like there Grande García said,
because they were not half past eleven when she was back with the money. Took him Rosalia forward
and was glad to have enough to meet Torres and Sobrino, atencioncillas maintaining a rest
for a little more or less.

"I do not know how to thank you ...-- said vehemently to his illustrious friend, shaking hands
-. Everything will soon return home, because I like my jewelry to make these trips; and only by
a great need ...».

No one knows how he pushed the conversation to a certain apurillo
who had, by calmly a rogue administrator ... Within two or three days
... How do those who deny this please had behaved so well?

Rosalie thought he tore a piece of his heart when you were among
the ten hard hands with thirst-quenching metal of his friend.

But there was no choice. Dona Candida became very joyful to see Bringas, who said that felt better,
although very weak in the head. The doctor had examined in the morning and prognosis was favorable.
Soon regain sight ... y. .. Even thought he saw something when departed the band ... What was
needed was a lot of rest, patience and take with method and timeliness
prescribed medicines.

"Who has come?" - Bringas asked sharply.

- I think it is Mr. Torres - said Candida - which has come to ask you.

- I have head so weak and yet so upset, I thought I heard counting money ... Although not want,
and although my doctor ordered me not to tamper with anything, I can not provide attention
to everything that happens at home. I can not help. I have the ear alert, and even when I sleep
I seem to not escape me no sound.

She said to him that all diseased brain wisely calls inaction that he must surrender their senses to
indifference and rest, that while he was in bed he had not been to make conversation, and that even
their children would enter the room.

This was manifested forming, with a deep sigh, and said that I needed more patience and strength
of will was to suppress their desire to know everything and give orders.

While this was spoken in the dark bedroom, Rosalie Torres whispered to La Salette. Great as
were the precautions taken to make no noise of money to have twenty
hard silver, tin tin was some slight vibrating in the room and spread
throughout the house in faint waves to reach the ear subtle Bringas.

Torres was most affected by the disease Your friend, expressed the hope that it was not anything
serious ... The bookkeeper Mompous had a similar attack in the light. "Nothing, that being one
day write, he was blind ... At first thought it was drop serene,
but ten days of sale and some medicines was good, though always delicate.

In the bathrooms are finished fifth ...». cure Bye the above so happy to take your money as afflicted
by the misfortune of D. Francisco.

A Isabelita, which was sad, concerned and not wanting to eat, she was sent home from Candida
to place him there all day playing with Irene and other girls in the neighborhood. Alfonsin was to
school, and Paquito, whom her father's illness was very sad, did not leave the house and wanted
a bite to eat at lunch. Candida was the only person who was there
a regular appetite.

"We need food, even making an effort - said that of Bringas -. Do not let you go well. We must
take strength to watch and work and take care all ... I also I have wanted, but I domain, daughter,
and as per requirement, because it is necessary. "

Shortly after our friend received a esquelita of Miracles in telling him that everything was finally
settled satisfactorily, and that waiting for the night. The letter breathed joy and satisfaction.

"This
poor Miracles do not know what is happening to us breaking ...-- Rosalie said the letter -. Poor
I beg you not to miss this night. Son, go there and give it a moment account of this disaster
... Look, you go through the return home of Fish and Carolina also
whole ... Ah, she has fault, with their hair works.

What a grotesque woman !...».

The seamstress was that day, but the lady saying goodbye was not Mary Magdalene to taffeta, to
return next week. In the afternoon was also Milagros, who felt not have known much before the
event to be flying to console his friend. His grief sincere was not a party to conceal the satisfaction
of the lien for the successful settlement of their conflict metal at the critical day. How
and how he had made the arrangement, I would say later, it was not intrude on the occasion of
things that did not care ... "And the doctor say?

". The excellent lady expected that blindness was an uneasiness a
few days.

Ask God to heal the man as well, that model of parents ... "How you feel you can not come tonight
to my house ... It'll be the meeting very bright, and as for the
buffet will be most wonderful ... Ya, ya I'll tell you how ... There
for a while. "

Bidding farewell at the door, could not repress some
very spontaneous outbursts of his passion dominant. As they say a
secret of importance, told her friend that that would evening dress
with a hint of white muslin scarf, lilac, which had placed inset and
a jersey Watteau ... At the last minute had been arranged as a T-shirt
he was sent to Paris to San Salomó ... I thought her hair combed up,
wavy large braid around the head and long locks behind ... 'Well,
not you mood to hear such rubbish ... Bye bye ... Tomorrow I will
come to know and follow our D. Francisco and counting, counting ...».

Bringas,
they all found out, he told his wife:

"I've heard your whispers with
Tellería at the door. What about? Have you dropped a fool? ... Poor
woman
