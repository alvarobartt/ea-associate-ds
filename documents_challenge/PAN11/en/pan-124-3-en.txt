 

This was the P. Joseph Tolu, who at seventy-five years of age increased from this work to eternal
rest in the village of San Rafael, to May 10, 1717.

To this holy man was born November 22, 1643 at Potager, instead of the island Sardinia, was
in the province received in the Company, having 21 years of age, to May 2, 1964 and he spent
74 years in this province, where he concluded that he lacked studies and received the sacred
orders, went to the Missions of the Guarani, where he lived for a
long time result of the Indians.

Here God would give to understand the many jobs he was ready to carve the crown of his merits, and
was as follows:

Had just one day to say mass, and as he retreated to his apartment to give thanks to Our Lord, he saw
in ecstasy, surrounded by a troop of strangers and also saw cultivating
the land himself with a hoe in hand, filled with all perspiration,
without any of those present, moved with pity, it is determined to
take the hands that rustic instrument and to help in that office.

Father was Joseph strangely amazed and dejected, not knowing what he meant was with the vision,
until shortly after passing the orders of superiors to the conversion of Chiriguan√° met him in
the reduction of San Ignacio, where although there was a large crowd people, with all the talk that
his conversion was to preach to the stones, or as they say, in the desert, unable to reduce or even
just one of those stubborn, and still have a servant you attend on the altar, so he was obliged
to cultivate their hands a little garden, and the sweat of his brow pick something with which to
pass the life going in person to the forest to bring a bundle of
wood and the river for a pitcher of water, looking meanwhile those
Barbarians without moving to help.

I then remembered that, before the Lord had shown him, and so suffered with great value these
and other very serious discomfort as cruel barbarians, who laid the horses to graze in your
garden, to take in a moment the sweat from his face and work their hands. And through that land
be so difficult to grow and so hard to receive the seed of God's word, as though I worked very
very little fruit picking, yet that does not put his hands up the work until he was called superiors
to be operator at the College of Tarija, where he field in which
to exercise his zeal, with fewer jobs, but more fruit
