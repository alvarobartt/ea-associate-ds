 No less no more. Over time, I started
writing this article satisfies my rash promise, the man could have been a fertile imagination
to write the history of mankind, and in less time, my girlfriend can make the most of its history.
Do not let your will, because I have come to learn well and do not want to imagine, but you can,
when I wrote all these afanadísimo candideces and innocent, so-so, for example through, my lady
has founded new empires created by the constitutions invented the philosophies, and equipment, and
erect monuments to the emotions, evergreen.

This analysis I am ashamed and humiliated, and full of vanity, and, although not Sylphs, but men like me,
the audience has read with me, have made the most suspicious of this
writing, I had no sleep or mood or the time to do soon.

Cordova editor of this work, please provide the century was one of
his articles, and I naturally chose Cordoba, as the province of Cordoba,
where I was born and raised.

My extreme laziness has prevented me until now to keep my word to
write. Perhaps to compensate for what I'm missing that a number of difficulties
and objections, which was half thinking of condemning the editor,
to justify my late fruit of my work.

What essential difference or significant difference can be accidental or is that, near Cordoba, Seville
and jaenense? Back in the old can be everything, because communications
were so easy, and it was easier to live isolated and sedentary, but
the day is, men and women in the neighboring provinces, but apartadísimos
nations far distant lands and kingdoms, and how visitors are often
persist variety and distinction of a kind, giving you the opportunity
to describe women, their customs, beliefs, ways of thinking and feeling,
appearance, continent and costumes distinguish the point at which
the pictures or descriptions of them, vary by subject, not just for
style of painting or describe?
