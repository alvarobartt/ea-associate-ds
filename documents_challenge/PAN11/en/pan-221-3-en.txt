 

Those who died had occupied the highest seats. Located at the entrance to the street Ramiro
I watched from the side, unable to distinguish the Saracen.

Two hours and those infamous victims would burn at the stake as scapegoats of Scripture, the villages
and fields would be purified and the God of modern Israel, the suction from the sky the rich smell
of sacrifice would appease their anger and fall his blessing on the
righteous city, more Catholic than Rome, more jealous than the old
Jerusalem.

The ritual began. A bishop went up to the altar. The deacons took the admirable mitra curd symbolic
gems offered by the City Council. Shortly after thick cloud of incense ascended in the luminous
space as in the first sacrifices of the Old Law sermon Ended and Mass, the reporter read the
oath of the people, and Ramiro joined his voice to another, I swear!
sharp and booming, uttered at a time throughout the crowd, and, in
the words of the peasants, listened to more than one mile radius.

A Cathedral Singer read the letter immediately and superstitions crimes against faith, and continuous
act which had abjured his errors were taken to the cage wood, which
stood in the middle of the plaza, to listen, one by one, in the presence
of people reading their causes and convictions before being reconciled.

That

part of the usual self-produced a general weariness. The crowd, eager to see to appear relaxed,
was, at every moment, signs of impatience. Aguirre yawned several times, and Ramiro, squinting eyelids,
leaned his head against the black drape that hung from a window.

Defenders of fornication, several bigamous, Judaizers sorry, false priests, a beggar who was
posing in villages by the Holy Office commissioner and some make who had uttered profanities and
oaths, were sentenced to flogging, to prison to the galleys.
