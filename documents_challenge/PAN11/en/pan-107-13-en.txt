 Something square, report, standing there like a monolith
the sidereal time of the cataclysm. At the entrance, but inside the building line, a dozen huge
columns which end truncated ... in a vacuum. Do not say nothing, have a mission to hold nothing,
never hold anything. My friend Rafael Pombo, one of the first Spanish-speaking poets spend
their lives looking to the Capitol and doing projects reforms. The ministers will tremble
when they see it appear in the office with your roll on arm.
