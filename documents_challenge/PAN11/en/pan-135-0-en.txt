here the testEssere rich, it's nice, it will be all that the General will, though I suspect, I do
not know why that should be a gentleman, born and raised in a very poblachón, lisping, throwing
so much fun, and more specifically for commercial events shine, pretty dress, and capture the
hearts of the Roma and the cool, who agrees to look like elegant rooms, true love and deep inspiration
to a young woman and make educated so happy. See, MOM, I have no reason to love your niece and
future prefer my Greek. And don't give me the objection that my Greek is to be a heretic
or schismatic. Fixed-that is a very good Catholic. If so, there would be a good friend of Father Gonzalez,
who introduced him in the sacristy, for more than a week. Listen, MOM? ... What? ... I want
to go? Now is the father Gonzalez replied. He says that the Greek narcissistic is not always natural,
but migration and temporary. Said to be the first Secretary of the Legation to Spain in Athens and
Constantinople, who came to Madrid for four months of actual license. (Return it Manolita to talk by
phone.) Listen, Father González, whatever it is, you have almost
all the faults I have known and treated narcissist, I walked with
him to the deserted streets of Retiro Park and along the banks of
the pond, leaving Dona Rita respectable distance: so have mercy on
us and preach to my mother, and in General not to persist in that
I'm married with that abominable nephew ... The Sky!

What horrible props, such as complicated conspiracy against a poor
girl without experience.

I do not speak the father Gonzalez, General tells me. Is your home and not the narcissistic from which
I speak.--Oui? ... Eh ... Today it is outrageous to me more and more defiant than ever. MOM has
been playing with the doctor sitting with his father González or translate ...
