 

The main purpose of this novel, like all all writing, should be to delight and inspire. Perhaps
this novel stands out to me because I am optimistic, forgiving, and aesthetic. The novel also makes
me sad and open to the moral ugliness that can reach people. In the end, I would say there are some
very excellent people in this novel Mr. Lasso.
