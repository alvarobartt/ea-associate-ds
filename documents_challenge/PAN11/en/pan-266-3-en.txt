 

"Do not cry, do not cry - Polo said a little stunned, staring at the tablecloth -. When I see you so
distressed I do not know how I feel. Indeed, a curse on us ...Â».

And pouring from his chest as big a sigh that seemed to snort a lion,
he meditated a short time, head on his hand.

Both weighed him an idea he had.

"I have an idea, Torment, I have an idea - he whispered like a whimper -. Here the say, and
do not laugh at it. It is an idea born in my solitude, raised in my sadness, and you both look
a little wild ... Is that because there is no help for me in this society, as I'm not as strong
as my passion and I've made in my state so great horror, I have been come to mind to land,
but a lot of land, between me and this country and I happened to my bones back in the latest
in the world, on an island in Asia, or in California or in any British colony ... There are beautiful
lands over there, land that is havens, where all is innocence of manners and true equality,
land without history, girl, where no one would question what he thinks, fertile fields, where

- Give me a reason.

- Not.

- But one reason ...

- Not.

- I will answer you with a thousand
arguments that will convince fixed. I thought so much of it! ... I

that seem so huge so terrible, so universal, are grains of sand, when
the thought shot this ball and go to where it is now is night. Beware
that the planet is large, care is great, and in it all kinds of things,
people! ... Lie to think ...

Torment not started to think about anything,
and if not, I'd think he meant. Silent, looked their own hands crossed
on his knees.

"Give me a reason - repeated Polo -; tell you something
that you have occurred
