 

Also I had fancied that Chisco looked very favorably Tona. This did not speak my uncle, but
at mozallón, and talk about something, the two of them up once a "Prao-Council."

- Jorrios! - He said climbing ahead of me, without a moment and turn
away, but air shaking his right hand.

No doubt I got the answer, and asked a more strict.

Diómela in these terms:

- It would be wrong in eya puestus the pensaris of unu ... Esu and
that!

... But mine will Jacia quite another par.

The Pitu, I put the casu, it is pleitu difirente.

- So Pete ... And she, as repolluda and so guapote, do you share?

-
Esu is what I do not know ... nor can he know what tampocu.

- It
is very possible ... but before you put a blemish on the good maid.

-
A flawless!

... And what was eya?

- No clear painted it, but gave it to understand.

After pondering for a good thing the girl, adding "and that that

- What I would say,

- And what are his father
or his mother to cross?

- What do I know?

Stories.

- So stories ... Who is the father?

- Nah, you Echeli a galgu.

-
Anda, dark!

And the mother?

- Now you panicle!

And does he have at home!

- Who, man?

- Nah, you.

- Me?

- Nah,

- Just say a thousand devils take you: who is
the mother of Tona?

- Pos Facia.

- Facia! - Exclaimed in amazement
-.

But Facia married?

- At vistu - I answered the mozallón with too much phlegm.

- Who? - He inquired.

- That's the story - he pointed at the ground he answered back with
the forefinger of his right hand, without looking or slow the pace.

-
Well, Tell it to me then - I said then, sitting astride the peak of
a overhanging rock beside the trail, not so much more comfortable
hearing what I recount Chisco, as resting from the fatigue that was
giving me that our continued up the slope the bitter mountain.
