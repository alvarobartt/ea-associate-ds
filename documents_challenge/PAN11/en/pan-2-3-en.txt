societies of both of the regions are very consistent in the fundamentals in particular how education
is important above all. They should be compared to see where the same fundamentals such as the same
institutions cause the same results while giving consideration to the geographical differences.
My quick three month trip to Spain is inadequate to make a solid assessment of this particularly
as within Europe Spain's society and people are unique due to the ethnicity and geography of the
region. I also did not have enough time to visit several regions that I consider especially important such
as Extremadura, Galicia, Asturias, Aragon and Navarra that deserve special attention for various
reasons. However I can make some general observations from my quick visit to the rest of Spain. Primarily
they consist of four major social groups. To Summarize: What opinions can be expressed about
the character, customs, institutions, economic situation, literature,
and the future of Spain?

Is it the Spanish people are similar and harmonious? Has the constitutional system of Spain had a real
affect on Spain as a society and state? What has been the influence of the revolutions of
the current century? What hope can be found in the current situation? I will try to answer
these questions as concisely as possible. Spain can be considered to have three different faces.
The faces are divided both legally and politically. The amount each of these affects it varies widely
depending on how it is evaluated.
