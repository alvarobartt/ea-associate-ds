 Shy girl that was perhaps the best companion to Ulysses. Also, I was
prepared for what he had seen in his childhood, to be the wife of a Marine ... Farewell to Professor!

They
married.

Then, Ferragut, who could not live idle, returned to sea, but as first officer of an ocean liner
that made regular trips to South America. For him, this amounted to be used in a floating office,
visiting the same ports, invariably repeating equal work. His mother was satisfied to see him in
uniform. Fixed his eye tape on the calendar as the wife of an employee's fixed on the clock. He
was certain that after two months, he would appear again coming across the land, charged exotic
gifts, like a husband who returns from the office with a bouquet purchased the street.

Returning from the first two trips went to wait on the dock, looked
around her gold lace cap and blue coat with passengers on ships that
were moving decks with the joy of coming to Europe.

On the next trip, Dona Cristina forced her to stay home, fearing that
the excitement agglomerations and jeopardize its next port motherhood.

Then, in each of its arrivals, Ferragut saw a new child, but always the same: first, a wrapper
of batiste and lace held by a nurse Sunday best, then - when he was captain Transatlantic - a
little boy with skirts, chubby, round head covered with silky lint, tending to it's arms and finally,
a boy who began to go to school and seeing his father grabbed his hard right hand, admiring it
with deep eyes, as though he saw in his person the realization of all the forces of the universe.

Don
Pedro the professor continued to visit the home of Dona Cristina, although less frequently. He
had resigned and coldly angry gesture of the man who thinks he has come too late and is convinced
that his misfortune is the work of the neglect ... If he had spoken
before!

The certainty of its importance is not allowed to doubt that she would have accepted with joy.

Despite
this conviction, could not contain aggressiveness at times ironic, that is vented classic inventing
nicknames. The young wife of Odysseus, bent over her lace work, Penelope was awaiting the return
of errant husband.

Cristina accepted this nickname, for knowing vaguely that it was a good queen customs. But the
day the professor, by logical deduction, called Telemachus to Tape
son, Grandma protested.

- His name is Stephen, like his grandfather
... Telemachus That is the name of theater.

In one of his trips took Ulysses a scale of a few hours at the port
of Valencia to see his godfather.

From time to time received letters from the poet, growing shorter
and sad, shaky letters that betrayed its decline.

Upon entering the office felt the same impression of the sleepers
of the legends, who believe waking up after a few hours of sleep and
stayed dozens of years.

Everything was like in its infancy: the busts of the great poets at the height of the libraries,
crowns in their glass cages, jewelry and statues won by force of consonants in their windows
and pedestals, the books of brilliant back to forming tight battalions along shelves. But the
whiteness of the bust had taken a chocolate color, the bronzes were red with rust, was green gold,
crowns are leafless. It seemed there was rained ash on the immobility of things.

People offered the same aspect of neglect and decay. Ulysses met the poet skinny and yellow, deep
in an armchair, his beard white luenga, one eye almost closed and
Another huge open.

Upon seeing the ocean, broad chest, strong man, tan, Labarta is began to mourn a child hiccups,
as if crying on the misery of human illusions, on the deceptive brevity of life that needs
the waves of constant renewal.

More work still cost Ferragut recognize a lady that was small and
cramped with the poet.

His skeleton hung flaccid fat tissues, like rags of past luxury. The head was small, her face
wrinkling had the wintry apples, plums, of all fruits that contract and mummified, losing their liquid.
"Doña Pepa !...» The tuteaban old couple now in the presence of Ulysses, with the quiet amorality
of those who are close to death and forget the fears and scruples of a life that is crumbling
behind him.

The ocean seen in this physical misery the sad end of an absurd diet,
happy and childish candy serve as the basis of nutrition, the major
rice-dish daily watermelon and melon filling in between meals, ice
cream served in cups enormous, spreading the perfume of honeyed snow.

They both spoke sigh of illnesses, who judged incomprehensible, attributing to ignorance of doctors.
Consumption was suddenly attacking the people of the countries abundant.

His life was smelted in a blast of liquid sugar ... And yet guessed Ferragut the disobedience of
the old couple to the disciplines of the regime, its concealment Child tricks to please their
own fruits and syrups, the charm of its existence.

The interview was short. The captain had to return to Grao, where
he waited his transatlantic soon to sail for South America.

The poet cried again, kissing his godson. I would not see more to this giant that seemed to repel
their weak hugs with the bellows of his breath.

- Odysseus, my son ... Valencia always thinking ... Make for it all
you can ... And you know.

Always Valencia!

What he vowed all the poet, not understanding what was expected of him Valencia, ocean simple
wandering the seas.

Labarta wanted to accompany him to the door, but sank into his chair, obedient to the despotism
of his loving companion, who feared for him major catastrophes.

Poor Dona Pepa! ... Ferragut felt like to laugh and to mourn when
receiving a kiss from his mouth wrinkled, whose hair had become spikes.

It was a kiss that recalls old beauty in contact with a handsome, a barren woman kiss caressing
the child might have.

- The unfortunate Carmelo! ... Do not write, and do not read ... Ay! What will become of me?
...

He spoke of the decline of his poet with pity of a strong and healthy. Is terrified to think about
the years he could survive his master.

Who look, not looked upon herself.

A year later, the captain found in Port Said, at the back of the Philippines,
a letter his godfather.

Doña Pepa had died, and Labarta, shaking his tearful stupor of its doldrums, the long goodbye
with a song. Ulysses spent the eyes of the newspaper clipping was within the letter containing
the last verses of the poet. They were verses in Castilian. Bad! ... After that, it was undoubtedly
his approaching end.

He had no opportunity to see him again: he died while traveling.

Upon landing in Barcelona his mother gave him a letter written almost in agony. "Valencia, my
son always Valencia!" And after repeating several times this recommendation, let him know it was his
heir.

The books, statues, all the glorious memories Labarta, went to Barcelona
for decorate the house of the sailor.

Telemachus could entertain the small breaking the old crowns troubadour, tearing pictures of volumes,
with the unconsciousness of a spirited child who his father is far
away and was exposed to two ladies who adore him.

Furthermore, the poet left his godson an old house in Valencia, more land and a certain amount
in marketable securities. Total: thirty thousand dollars.

The other guardian of his childhood, the strong Triton, remained insensitive to the passage of time.
Ferragut met him several times, on arriving at Barcelona, ??installed in your home, in dull
hostility Dona Cristina, dedicating to Ribbon and her son a part of the care that was previously
only Ulysses.

Steven wanted the little house knew the great-grandparents.

- Did
I leave it?

... You know that back in the Navy men are strong as bronze.

You really leave me? ...

He doubted his influence with the angry gesture of soft Dona Cristina. "Trusting his grandson
the Triton, that instills the love of maritime adventure, like Ulysses?

... Behind blue devil!

The doctor wandered bewildered through the port of Barcelona ... Too much noise, too much movement.
He walked proudly beside Odysseus, making the adventures of his years of ocean tramp and cosmopolitan.
Saw in him the greatest Ferragut: sea man his grandparents, but with capacity; adventurous of all
the oceans as he had been but with a place on the bridge, coated
conferring absolute command responsibility and danger.

To re-embark Ulysses Triton retreating to their domains.

- Next time - said to console to leave without the child of his nephew.

And a few months later he reappeared, bigger and bigger, uglier, more
tanned, with a smile silent words before exploding in Ulysses, the
same as a thundercloud burst in thunder.

Back from a trip to the Black Sea, Mrs Cristina said her son:

- Your uncle is dead.

The pious Christian lady lamented the disappearance of his brother,
spend their prayers, but he insisted with some cruelty in the story
of his sad end.

I could not forgive its fatal intervention in the fate of Ulysses.

Had died as he lived, at sea, victim for his temerity, without confession, as well as a pagan.

Another legacy that fell on Ferragut ... His uncle had been released to swim on a sunny morning
winter, and had not returned.

The older of the coastline explained to her how the accident: a fainting,
a collision with the rocks.

The Dotor was still strong, but the years do not pass without leaving
footprint.

Some believed in a fight with a "pot head" or other carnivorous fish which hunt in the Mediterranean
waters. In vain the fishermen took their boats for all incoming and outgoing angularity of the
promontory, exploring the dark caves and low funds crystalline transparency. Nobody could find
the corpse of Triton.

Ferragut remembered the procession of Aphrodite that the doctor had described so often in the summer
nights in the distance watching the headlights.

Perhaps he had encountered the joyous procession of the Nereids,
by binding to it forever.

This absurd assumption that Ulysses made mentally, incredulous, sad
smile, repeated at the same time just thinking of many people from
the Navy.

They refused to believe in his death. A sorcerer does not drown. Down would have found something
very interesting and when tired of living in the green depths swam back to his house.

No, the Dotor not dead.

And for many years, women who followed the coast at dusk quickened their pace, crossing to distinguish
in the dark waters a tree or a package of seaweed. They feared that arise from Triton soon, bearded,
lewd, dripping, returning from his foray by the mysterious depths
of the sea.

IV

FREYA

The name of Ulises Ferragut began to be famous among the captains of the Spanish ports. Nautical adventures
from the time it came through very little in this popularity. Most of them had braved greatest
dangers, and if he liked, was the instinctive respect Men who feel strong and simple with an
intelligence that considered superior.

No other reading than his career, spoke with awe of the many books Ferragut filled the cabin,
many of them on matters that seemed mysterious. Some even made inaccurate statements to complement
the prestige of his comrade:

- He knows a lot ... In addition to ocean, is a lawyer.

The consideration of his fortune contributed equally to the appreciation. It was a major shareholder
to the shipping company that provided services. Calculated with proud peers exaggerated the wealth
of his mother, tasándola in millions.

Find friends all vessel flying the Spanish flag at the stern, no matter
what its port of origin and the regionalism of his crew.

All he wanted: the Basque captains, sober words, rude and familiarity confianzudo; Asturian
and Galician masters, lovesick and wasteful, that belie its character greed and sadness inland, the
masters in Andalusia, which seem to lead in its funny language reflects
the white light Cádiz and its wines, the captain of Valencia, to talk
politics on the bridge, imagining what could be the future Marine
Republic; Masters of Catalonia and Mallorca, who know the business
as thoroughly as their owners.

Whenever I connected the need to defend their rights, immediately thought Ulysses. None wrote
like him.

The old drivers coming from below, seamen who began his career in
the boats Coastal and barely fit their expertise to the handling of
books, Ferragut spoke proudly

- They say that people are gross sea
... There you have to Don Luis, who is one of us.

They can ask whatever they want ... A wise!

The name of Odysseus made them hesitate. I thought nickname, and not wanting to incur a lack
respect, had finally transformed into Don Luis.

For some, the only defect Ferragut was his good luck. He still had not lost a ship commanded by him. And
all good sailing ocean without rest should be history of these misfortunes to be a full captain.
Only the farmers do not lose ships.

When his mother died, Odysseus was undecided about the future, not
knowing whether to continue his seafaring life or take a brand new
one.

His relatives in Barcelona, ??merchants agile understanding for evaluation of a fortune, which
amounted to the notary had left and his wife, and adding Labarta and the doctor, just shy of
one million pesetas ... And a man with so much money going to continue
living the same as a poor captain needs salary to maintain his family?

...

His cousin Joaquin Blanes, owner of a knitwear factory, he repeatedly urged to follow their example.
Should stay on the ground and use their capital in Catalan industry. Ulysses was in the country,
by his mother and being born in the neighboring land of Valencia. Needed men of wealth and power
to intervene in government. Blanes was regionalist policy with the enthusiasm of a bourgeois
who is released into fictional adventures.

Tape did not say a word as to her spouse. She was the daughter of a sailor and had accepted be
the wife of another. Also, understand marriage according to family tradition: absolute mistress
women inside the house, but reliant on foreign affairs the will of the Lord, the warrior, the head
of household, without allowing thoughts or objections on their actions.

Ulysses was adopted for himself the decision to leave the seafaring life. Worked by the suggestions
of his cousins, he needed only a little dispute with one of the directors shipowner's house to
offer his resignation, no one could get him to back the requests and explanations of the other
associates.

In the first months of his earthly existence, missed the despairing immobility things. The world
was a disagreeable stiffness and hardness. He felt something akin to a principle faint to see
that everything was still where he left him, without allowing the
lower back and forth, the slightest fantasy dynamics.

In the morning, the half-opening his eyes, he felt the sweet sensation of freedom irresponsibly.
Nothing with the fate of the house. The lives of those who slept on the other floors, above and
below it, were not entrusted to their supervision ... But a few days did he needed something
that was one of the greatest satisfactions of his life: the will
of power, like remote.

Two maids came embarrassed to air their voices and peals of ringing. This was all for he who
had sent dozens of hard rough men that instilled terror down ports.

No one consulted him now, while at sea all sought his advice and often needed to disrupt your
sleep. The house could exist without his daily visit from the caves to the roof, going to the
last tap.

Women who did the cleaning in the morning he was forced to take refuge in the office with their land
broom. Not was allowed to comment, could not extend an arm gallon, same as when scolded the
barefoot and bare-chested grumetería, demanding that the cover is clean as lounge. He felt
dwarfed, exonerated. I thought of Hercules dressed as a woman, spinning her distaff. The love
of family had made him renounce his life of a mighty man.

Only the treatment of his wife, who surrounded himself with assiduous care, as if to compensate
with that of the long separation, he made the situation bearable. And she was satisfied his
conscience by making father "earth", worrying about her son, who began to prepare to join the
Institute, reviewing their books, helping in the understanding of texts.

But these pleasures were not long lasting.

Bored him family gatherings at home and in their relatives, conversations with uncles, cousins
??and nephews on earnings and businesses or on the defects of centralized tyranny. According to them,
all the calamities of heaven and earth came from Madrid. The governor of the province was the
"consul of Spain. "

These merchants only interrupted their criticism in religious silence to hear the music Wagner struck
on the piano by the children of the family. A friend sang tenor Lohengrin in Catalan. The enthusiasm
was the most excited to roar: "The hymn ... the anthem! " There was no mistaking. For them there
was only one hymn.

And accompanied with a Canturri softly to the liturgical music of The Harvesters.

Ulises recalled with nostalgia his life transatlantic commander: a life wide, worldwide, incessant
and varied horizons, cosmopolitan crowd. It looked stopped on covered by groups of smart girls who
asked new dances in the week. Out his passage fluttering white skirts, veils that flowed like
colored clouds, laughter and trills Spanish speakers in a music that seemed to set in, all the playful
noise of a cage Tropic bird.

Former presidents of the Republic - general or doctors who came to rest to Europe - we had on
the bridge, with a serious Napoleon, the main facts of his story. Men business, to go to America,
he hoped his great plans: rivers changed from river, rail through the jungle, learned monstrous electric
forces cascades of several kilometers wide, the desert cities vomited in a few weeks; all the
wonders of a world in puberty, you want to conceive as her young imagination. It was the demiurge
of small floating world, provided he pleases of joy and love.
In the hot afternoons of the Line, was enough to give an order to
shake the torpor brutish of things and beings. "Let the music up and
serve refreshments." And in a few minutes Couples whirled along the
deck, smiling mouths, eyes lit up in a bright spot of hope and desire.
Behind the praise sounded. Midwives will were very distinguished.
"You see he is a person well." Waiters and crew made a relationship
exaggerated his wealth and his studies. Some young people who sailed
to Europe with imagination in the very hotbed novel, contracted disappointed
to learn that hero was married and had a son. Lonely ladies, lying
on a chaise longue, with volume in hand, managed, and saw him, the
corolla of her skirts, holding legs in such haste that always left
them more exposed. Then, fixing him a deep look, initiated the dialogue,
always the same way:

- How did you come to master, so young?

Ah,
misery! ... He who had lived several years, from one end to another
of the Atlantic, a rich, lively, fragrant, sometimes by resisting
to the vagaries of feminine wisdom, surrendering other with discreet
modesty ocean, was now no other admirers the tribe vulgarota Blanes,
no other illusions that he suggested his cousin, the manufacturer
excited because the great apostles of the party were set on a certain
sympathy with the master.

Every morning, on waking, suffered a rude
shock in their tastes. The first thing that looked room was a "no
personality", a house that had nothing of him, arranged by the Cleaning
maids with neat and lack of logic, constantly changing site of things.

He
recalled with nostalgia his cabin small and tidy, where there was
no furniture to escape his sight for a box whose contents were not
in his memory. His body slid with disengage from custom, through the
passes of the furniture. She had adapted to all incoming and outgoing
angles, such as shellfish flesh is adapted to the inner windings of
their shells. The cabin seemed formed by secretions of his being:
it was a shell, a shell that was with him from one end to another
of the oceans, heated to high temperatures Tropics, closing with an
Eskimo hut caulk the approach to the cold waters.

He inspired a love
like he feels the monk by his cell, but this cell was global, and
enter it after a storm last night on the bridge or from a fall to
land in the various ports, I saw the same thing, with papers and books
still on the table, clothes hanging on the racks, still photographs
on the walls. Changed the daily spectacle of sea and land, changing
the temperature and the course of stars, the people, huddled in winter
coats, white dress in a week and looked to the sky the new star of
the opposite hemisphere ... and your cabin always well, like a corner
of a planet apart, insensitive to variations of this world
