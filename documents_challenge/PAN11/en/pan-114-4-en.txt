 No doubt all those truths, blatant, simple and be obvious that the
interests of powerful men or cunning has had some hard times to conceal or misrepresent, have been
concealed or distorted because it has always been infinite number of papar in the world. Of
these truths, those relating to money, capital or wealth, are those that have offered more encouragement
to these misrepresentations and deception; but though I can not deny that economists, that place,
so to speak, definitely clear these truths, they do a great service to the public, can not be
denied either that the Most of these truths are what are known as Pero-Grullo.
