 

That prompt and proper administration of justice is the first base of happiness, good order
and peace of all peoples of the world, no one can doubt, and that in any Astrea nation which
does not exercise his royal rule across the full of his power, not more that confusion and
disorder, serious evils of transcendence, of outrage and pain, is also a I really do not need
proof, being well known. Indeed, where justice does not prevail, nothing good can be: innocence is
no safe haven anywhere; seeds discord abound want to do, the barbarous law of force with tyranny
oppresses the weaker; and finally, how evil can afflict mortals, many are gathered in villages in
the realms, where benefits are unknown influences of justice.

Philippines, that precious jewel of the East, as it has been qualified and justice for other pens
before mine, it has throughout its extent the beneficial influence of Astrea, nor any the
readiness to desire it off: it is necessary to remove certain obstacles that will to be provided,
and to raise a total reform, as will be later, or taken other establishing enough to effect,
and this achieved, is the first step for the happiness of the Islands; industry remain as interesting
as the foot and form that is raised, is the largest obstacle to their prosperity, and impossible
to move one step forward, or it can have its good effects of laws, wiser, more just and far-sighted
they are. It will show: -

§. II.

LAND OF THE HEARING.

The high consideration and respect that the audience deserves Manila among the Indians, from even the tradition
among them, remembering those happy days when their magistrates visiting their provinces, and
they made during these visits as well to the people [1]. The judges guests were in fact more
severe than a judge, a friendly mediator in disputes of India, to compositions, celebrated transactions,
noted land boundaries, and even in terms of people, gave a sort of municipal ordinances that were
observed, and protejian against the abuse of the mayors, correjidores, and even knew in which
caused some priest, because as in these visits was not impose penalties, execute punishment,
nor adapted with violence, but minds together, cutting disagreements, and make disappear dissension
between families, between neighbors and even among peoples, these visits were truly a parental
visits and charity, and in them the Orijen High respect, consideration and appreciation of
the magistrates. Disappeared these visits, Like many other things that both prestijio acquired the
Spanish name, and with them a large element of many goods do not cause no harm: return to old
form and, about not being easy, nor would produce the goods as before, for reasons that about
being long enumerate, are of this place. However, to promote its restoration in the form given
limited powers and at certain periods, it would be an asset of incalculable
benefit and best consequences.

But the well of the Manila audience (say what they want their antagonists) I have a very convenient
for the disposition of the Indian Act, as to the amobilidad and time given to promotion of
their ministers, just scale should establish, found on the same grounds for the law, without
searching for others, some are very to everyone, that is, that not only is useful to reward
its magistrates, but also uprooted from friends and close relations that come in those countries where
long time resident. These friends of influence, if prejudicial to the administration line
of justice are in Manila an almost necessary for the short Spanish population [2], the absence
of any recreational or public distraction, and that with the laxity of the climate, and customs
and praise of the country, you enter a life spoiled and soft and loses that Enerji integrity
and European customs to the few years of residence in the Islands. Yes, the Philippines is
a country in which mental tasks and may be frequent or long; country that leans to leisure
and pleasure more than others, for its mild temperament produces all the lax habits behind
its climate, and even effeminate weakens the spirits, and cause the greater damage, the more
vivid are the passions, especially to youth.

But back to our purpose, although it is not strange to him the idea issued.

The audience of Manila has sought at all times with more or less effectively give further impetus
to the administration of justice in the islands with vast territory, but the effects never have
responded to their good wishes, because there are natural obstacles
that his authority can be overcome.

Of them will be discussed in the third paragraph, when speaking of the mayors and correjidores, let
us try to those who can overcome.

The incompetence of those in junior destinations salable and renounced, is an obstacle and
not a little package, to give impetus to the administration of justice. Scribes chamber receivers
and attorneys do not know or do not seek anything but to get the full potential of their offices.
These trades are very small numbers and little benefit, because in the vast expanse of military
jurisdiction in the wealthy people of the Philippines, the audit of war has all civil cases
so important in the Islands, and the audience is limited to criminal cases and land disputes between
Indians and not of much value, lawsuits and has the sole business of any trade value since
the publication code in that country, but these, not many, not too serious, which is not deactivated
when the idea you have some much consideration, but not what Gen.: reasons for not possible or
easy to buy and enter taught Spanish to serve those trades hearing. The consequences of this are
delays and losses on the early administration justice, the greater disorder in the offices of
the hearing, the lack of books of seats, registrations, and state
laws prevent relationships and, finally, that to stretch it out a
Order or trade, it must always do a minister who takes this job.

This Thin story, nothing exaggerated, you can easily know how many there will be difficulties to
overcome in order to march as best that can be, and not as it should, the administration of
justice; and for further proof of this truth, go down to explanations
and details more retail discussing some of the ideas expressed, and
other obstacles stating no less bulk, and that can be removed easily.

That the administration of justice is slow, even in the extreme, heavy
in the Philippines, I think is a truth is not brought into question,
but for those who may doubt it will bring reflections following.

Manila's audience consists of one room, who knows and fails on second and third instance all kinds
of business of the thirty-one provinces (today and thirty-two) which includes its territory Este.
A regent, five ministers and two prosecutors, its endowment, which very few times is complete, and
under the réjimen and how ordinary legal substantiation is observed, is impossible and any
failure to provide early and ongoing failure to matters of attribution. The various committees
outside of his ministry that weigh about the same magistrates, very serious and many of them,
is another obstacle, and not small, to be administered promptly and effective justice. Indeed,
income assistance and supervision of the finances public, a charge more than regular occupation
continues to be a good lawyer, if you have to serve which corresponds, has been from 1829 to 1839,
which was provided by particular lawyer, in charge of the ministers of the audience, and with actual
appointments with neglect and contempt of the law of India [3], which instructs: the judges
are no more than judges, and have no commissions, rather than those that the court gives them,
etc. The advice of government is another top destination as before, and has also been played by
a magistrate a few years. In 1837 was provided in another particular lawyer. The Audit of War Marine
and also was served a few years by another magistrate, and although in 1830 the auditor was war appointed
by the King, and took charge of his office, not the Marines who, but suffer mistake, even today
plays the same magistrate. It should be noted that these destinations assignments have decent,
and have great emoluments by reason of fees, and one and others, the salaries of ministers,
have enjoyed these at once, when they have served these jobs. The court of dead and missing
property, an institution that should be preserved and give her best, as we shall tell you the
reasons be expressed in a separate paragraph is another position that turns among the magistrates
of every two years [4], and this court is matters of importance, but that is a lot or a little
bump your organization, it is certain that There are far behind him, and that their course
is in the extreme slow, do not observe the law signal is sent every week day to see these
fights [5]. A former top joint Real Estate (discontinued now) attended as member of the regent of
the hearing, and failing the senior judge or minister oldest: the infinite expedients that knew,
and whom he output was to give a preference, occupying more than you can say, and much more, since
in this kind of business is accustomed always leave with more caution and care, the immediate
financial liability they caused, and the particular circumstances of being the only lawyer who
was involved in their decisions the minister of the audience, convince certainty to any of the above,
and that obviously went into them warily. Currently, the top joint finance litigation is composed
by three ministers, under General-president of the local deputy superintendent Finance [6], and
its business, but as many as the top joint of the former do not give in to gravity. The hall
call justice, which is the second known instance of the court appealed more cars and audience
of the day, also up three ministers, and in view of fiscal of civil, it's become, hear and rule
on such cars, which expedients, processes or causes, for some three names to fit you, yours are
bulky and complicated by nature and lots of points to embrace, and are therefore subject to occupation
and severity; and though not much, also distract and occupy the same business when still in progress
are room visits or calls from PC board that comprises Mr. regent or oldest minister in a civil attorney,
where as for advice, referral for consultation counter greater when you like. A board of auctions
also attend the ministers and civil attorney, who is also heavy and irksome occupation. Finally,
a lord judge rotated annually in the office of judge of sororities and fraternities, and another
is an advisor to cross what is the oldest generals, who with the tax commissioner and civil, comprising
the court of the bull, and I have some gratification but small. Another is director of the Monte
Pio, another guard, another judge of slavery and freedom, another judge of hospitals and nursing
homes rides and married expulsion to Spain [7] being separated from their women: law fall obsolete
as many good laws, another is a judge of protocols and lower courts, and in all these units is
occupation, as no shortage of issues and different business and by necessity all the progress
must be slow and even late, and they that are themselves or any serious complication.

The prosecutors, in addition to the duties of his vast tequios ministry, which are very large
and complicated (as it is common for any fiscal proberbio resists that office five years fulfilling
as it should), they call upon themselves the protection of Indians
and Chinese, reduced nothing less than to make themselves (and privileges
that those are) the defense of their people, and business even when
run over by a person believe that they have not been to do justice,
benefiting (and make it easily) to the tax shelters, and occupy, and
not a little at times, for nothing but detract from their important
work to the gentlemen of the prosecution when they seems no reason,
and right when you are.

Now if for a single room of a regent, five ministers and two prosecutors are also of their regular
duties so many charges and fees of such gravity and occupation as well is, how it is conceivable
that speedy justice is administered in any field? It is impossible whatever may be desired in this
particular interim is not removed with a strong hand all these barriers, rather each one alone
to hinder and delay, which can not subject to calculation, the progress of judicial affairs.

For
although there are more, not less serious, because this is a natural
obstacle, although it could removed somewhere, never will be entirely,
at least in many years.

More than half provinces are overseas, compared with the capital Manila, located on the island
of Luzon or New Castile, in many of these trips are subject to Monzon, that is, while specific
station or to come and return to their ports, and although the establishment of postal raised
throughout the Islands as set forth in 1837, to affect anything, it will be little or nothing,
because the islands do not take interim flight required to have vapor prosperity crossing
in the archipelago [8], this obstacle, natural in itself, cause delays
and delay that can only remove a new plan and plant Fixed municipalities
and, that is what expresses the end of this matter.

§. III.

OF THE MAYOR AND CORREJIDORES.

Demonstrated the many serious obstacles to the administration of justice in the Philippines which
is so early is desirable to the higher court, or is second-and Third, it is manifest that
mediate the most serious in the lower courts, for though much different to the statements, they
are no less serious and worthy of attention the government and those,
and the Corps colejisladores consideration in his day, to seek to
remove them as soon as that can be, and given the special law for
our overseas provinces, are taken into account and what the Government
has failed to do, is refine the work, and are completely removed,
starting a new but similar progress and characteristic of the progress
of those provinces, and provide them with consummate rejeneracion
perfect for a bouquet as important as the question, and draw from
it the fruits of all and corresponds crave.

They are most unhappy in the provinces of the Philippines in the lower courts to give them speedy
justice for what they are before the hearing of the territory, because if this many serious
attention and weighing on their small number of ministers is in itself a serious cause of delay,
given the provinces to lay correjidores mayors and (most military), and all dedicated mainly to
the care and promotion of their interests through trade, and applied to raise funds, whose
collection is at his office, to them advance their fortunes, in an act of justice but do not
take part or interest, so generals, Thin offering the actions required to sign the signature,
for all proceedings generals is sorted by address by counsel, to which end the causes go, lawsuits
and processes to Manila for advice, in consequence of the provinces there are no lawyers established,
excepting those two or three that are immediate to Manila.

Criminal cases are formed first a summary is called, the mayor [9] the town where the event occurs that
motivates, instructing the first dilijencias, the more times or almost every language of the
country, not knowing the Castilian, and four taken ill statements to the defendants, if any, reports
to the mayor or correjidor. This at fault reviewed and approved interpreter, and to be imposed
on what has been written has since then the car, sending those dilijencias translated into Castilian
by an Indian either understand something of our language, and continues with the same or another
that entitles Indian interpreter summary statements that you think, and with the same ignorance
in practice trials that started the mayor. Are not these items and the most apropos eligible to begin
a case? As happens so neither more nor less so happens, unfortunately.

In the state that looks like the mayor or correjidor, provides another
order of referral of acted for a lawyer from the capital, in view
of this and advise him to dictate the procedures and dilijencias as
justice, with which business that is already forgotten, until return
performances with opinion of counsel, and sometimes tend to spend
many days and even weeks and months, only to expect a timely occasion
to refer the summary to the consultant until vessel or passenger has
to carry, and this is already on the delay that is unsafe; more often
be witness to all in court.

As the summary forms usually with many defects, court leave and return to Manila, and thence to
the province several times, until the assessor, the mayor or correjidor mayor and understand
each other, usually with great difficulty and labor, and always with the consequent delay in
proportion to the distance of the province. Meanwhile many essential dilijencias lost or become irreparable
and useless for the delay, and as in the investigation of criminal acts that no progress in the
first dilijencias, rarely come on later, is very rare to see a summary inquest well-educated.

Finally declared, after due difficulties, enough to proceed, courts promoters are not prosecutors
or defense counsel are able to ask the cause each according to his ministry, and to every motion
that inmates or prisoners often presented The Indian defense, or any other incident that occurs,
the course is suspended and then adviser when opportunity: lately, do not disturb more in
particular, where If sentence is pronounced with counsel and with the delays everything else,
and given and published, the case is sent to the hearing, where prosecutors to request usually
return to the province to reform defects, and even some annulments,
with which can not administer justice, or to practice some interesting
dilijencia was omitted, and still can be useful.
