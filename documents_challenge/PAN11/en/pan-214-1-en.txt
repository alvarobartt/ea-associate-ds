 What I deny, and that is the question, is that fine progress
as it progresses arts chemistry or surgery, and the superiority of the novels French and Russian
on our own, are that those are written in the precepts of fine art and newly invented deep.

I
will concede that in everything, even in the fine points, there is
progress, as we technician or call the office, but, well I admit,
I recognize also that technical and progressive literature, little
importance compared with the essential it, in which there is no progress.

Recapacítese well and see that at no time placed men in the level of the most vulgar and culture
medium was then, it has taken more special studies or more years of learning to be a poet or
novelist that exercise any other occupation. All men, for example, can speak and write, but
not all drive the awl and tirapié, and may not apply to it with zeal and perseverance. Hence,
in a sense, may well be argued that it is more difficult to make a shoe that compose a poem. And
it is still easier and requires less propaedeutic writing a novel for which, prosody, art meter
and rhyming dictionary care little or nothing. So conceived, without any surprise, the vast number
of novels that make up now English, French, Russian, Italian, German, Hungarian, Polish, in
short, almost all the languages ??spoken and written in the various civilized countries of
the five parts of mondo.
