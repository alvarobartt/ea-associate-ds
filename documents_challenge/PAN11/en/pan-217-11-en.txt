 However, once Dona Rosalia up leaving them alone the tobacconist, Miguel
took her hand and almost forcibly kissed. Maxi was red and failed to say:

- Oh, my God! ...

Again finding himself whispered talk shows:

- I have to ask V. a
favor, Maxi.

- What is it?

- That gives me V. a lock of her hair.

The girl looked up in surprise.

- Did I give it V? - Repeated staring boldly.

Maxi looked down by an affirmative sign.

But no deviation one day and after these two, and three, and showed no signs of fulfilling its
promise. Miguel asked about details: she smiled without answering. Then the angry young man did
and avoided in turn to meet her. Maximina began to throw looks sad
and shy watching laughing inside.

Finally, one night on his own initiative, it came to sit beside him.

Our young man was adamant, he would not talk; affected take part
very active in sets of clothes.

Then the poor girl said weakly:

- Take V.

Miguel did not hear.

- Take V. - repeated a little louder.

As he turned he saw was holding a white piece of paper. Realized it was the lock of hair and
took him while pressing his fingers tenderly.

- Thanks, Maxi - he said .-- It touched accent V. very good, and every day ...

Before I could conclude, she stood up, came into the house. Miguel was savoring a sweet happiness
that had hitherto never liked, that of being loved that way so naive
and so pure.

My heart was filled with gentle feelings ineffable tenderness invaded
his soul, and said, "I do not want this child I too?

Why have not to tell?

Shaken by this sudden desire, rose from his chair and came home with
Maximina hoping to find and express what I felt at that time.

He walked in darkness room, dining room and hallway, calling softly,
but could not find it.

He looked to the kitchen and saw in it only to the taciturn servant
peeling potatoes.

It must have gone to his room, he said, and went down the ladder
sadly returned to the gathering, but crossing in front of the door
of the tobacconist who was dark, he decided to put the head in and
say:

- Maxi.

- What? - Answered a muffled voice.

- Oh, picarilla!

Is V. here?

And was introduced in the store.

- Where do you do?

- Here.

- Deme V. hand.

- Why, to kiss?

I will not, is V. very bad.

Miguel laughed, repressing it so you will not be overheard.

- No, baby, is to know where V. nothing more.

He sat beside her on a low chair.

- Why has escaped V. of the party?

-
And V. why looking for me?

- To tell it to V. one thing.

- What
is it?

--... That I wanted to V. very - passionate accent said, holding
her hand.

The girl was silent.

- And V. I will also wanting to me a little, is not it?

Neither answered.

- Come on, tell me V. yes ... even lie.

- I do not tell lies - said
the girl with a sweet voice.

- So, I do not want? ...

- Not saying
that.

Miguel enthusiastically embraced.

- Well I love you I love
you so beautiful and how good you are ...

Maximina to feel young
arms began to shake strongly.

- V. Let go! V. God release me!

-
Do I want you? Do you want?

- V. Let go, by God!

- No, tell me you
love me.

- Yes, I love him, love him; V. Let go!

The young man kissed
her passionately on the lips and let her escape to her room. He turned
to the party
