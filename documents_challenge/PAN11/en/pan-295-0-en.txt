 Because this is a sign of secure inheritance.

And you? What have you dreamt?

Me?
Last night, that we met with a black bull.

Well, that means we will discover a hidden treasure...Look, who says
that this old house that was once occupied by wealthy merchants it
is not inside a partition wall or in a good pot from the bigwigs.

I have heard tell that in the
past century a few powerful cloth merchants lived here and when they
died...none of the money was found. It may be that it is walled up. There
have been cases, many cases.

I am certain there is money
on this estate. But, to know where demonstrates these (indinos)hid
it. Is there no way to find out?

I do not know..murmured Benina, letting his mind wander toward the
oriental incantations proposed by Almudena.

And if it is not in the walls, under the tiles in the kitchen or
pantry can it be that those men hid it, believing that they could
enjoy it in the next life.

.. Perhaps.. Bt it is more likely that it is in the walls, or a supposition
that it is in the roof, between the beams.

I think you are right.

All the same, it can be above, rather than below. I assure you that
when the floor was strong in the hallways and dining room, they swept
through the mansion as if it would collapse, I believe I hear a little
noise... as if the metals are tinkling.

Did you
feel it? Yes, ma'am. And if not, try the same, now. He takes a walk
through the bedroom, stomping and we hear...Benina did as the woman
said, with no less conviction and faith that she, in effect...they
heard a metallic clang, which could only come from enormous quantities
of silver and gold (surely, more gold than silver)embedded in the
old factory.
