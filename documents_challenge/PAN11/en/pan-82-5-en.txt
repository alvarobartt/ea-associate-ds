is significant.

The Republic of Geneva,which for centuries was limited to the city of that name,increased in 1816,because
of the treaties of Vienna and Paris that annexed fifteen Saboyardos districts and six French.The
canton's population has increased to 83,345 inhabitants of which more than 9,000 are citizens of other
States of the Confederation,and about 12,000 foreigners -French today in majority.The capital alone
has 41,415 inhabitants,making Geneva first city in Confederation.Although inside the State two-thirds
of the inhabitants profess reformed religion or ritual called a Calvinist, and the Roman Catholics
make up,along with 1.000 Jews,the other third,in the capital,the majority of the reformed are not in
the same proportion.For the rest,even though you hear it in conversations in every instance German-Swiss,Italian,
English accents (by the abundance of travelers),and even the Romans themselves, the dialect spoken
in the Graubünden, French is the official and common languaje to
all people.

Geneva has had a history as stormy and difficult as fruitful, suffering, like all peoples of the
race of the Allobroges, invasions and subsequent domination of the Romans, Barbarians of the V
century, the Burguiñones, Ostrogoths and Franks, the Swiss and Savoyards
themselves and lately the French Republicans in 1798
