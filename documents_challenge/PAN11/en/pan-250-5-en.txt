 I have fear of coming Tirso, the desire and
fear.

Don José silent sadly, that did not like, but since he knew the next arrival Madrid with his eldest
son, had fought for the same soul that stirred misgivings Pepe, and
listening to him, he thought to himself heard.

- For our part - continued
Pepe - no one is to disturb this harmony.

Here, you've seen since we know, Millán, my parents live for this and for me, us to them. These
furniture that are older than me, have never heard a dispute not the slightest disrespect. Leocadia
and I tried to mime that old people over a new toy boy. Do you know why? Because we have not separated
ever, and we slept one night without kissing, or had a pain that is not the other, neither silent
nor joy, nor has anyone eaten a bun without saving the other, or a suit made without thinking
about how many clothes were each one, in a word, boy, our ideas, in my conviction, my parents
and the latter by goodness, I have linked all the love, treasuring day by day and hour by hour,
unmixed selfishness, without sharing it with anyone ... (A Don José is moistened the eyes of
taste.) Y now come Tirso, educated away from us, become a man ... and we welcome them with open
arms. For my part, I can not wait: a few more care will be playing Dad more of us at home.
But ... God knows!

- No buts about it, it seems that you have left something inside the
body, it is so brother yours like this that I have kidded myself to
everyone.

- You do not understand what I meant, Mom.

For us all the joys of earth are within these walls, we can, or try to give them to us each
other.

When it comes Tirso you will hear in different ways, and see in it any aspiration, any idea which
transcends the affection that we have.

- Wow, that was it! ideas now, hush, child, hush.

- At the time,
mother, at a time.

Dinner had ended. The immediate street noises were gradually ceasing; perceived more clear the distant
chime of a church, which announced the Midnight Mass, the children oil cans still happening
from time to time by Imperial Street, and other floors of the house rose, with uneven intervals,
songs, carols, laughter, screams and a cat that was meowing all night without eating smelling
bream.

- Remove the table - "Dona Manuela, and began to save for Don José
what little was left the perry and nougat.

- Do you want that you
go to bed between that and me? - Miller asked the patient to give
.-- Van twelve in suspense will take for you to bed.

As before Dona Manuela made and Leocadia, Pepe and Miller were pushing the chair from the dining
room cabinet in which he slept Don José; Leocadia folding the cloth fell and napkins. A moment
later, Jose was dismissed from the inside telling the Millán, he was back out to the dining
room

- If there is news, see tomorrow, eh? and bring me a newspaper, which
is the only distraction I have.

- Rest assured you, not fail.

Goodbye, Dona Manuela, who pass you good night, and today in one year. Goodbye, Leo. Who will
you please go down to open up?

The girl, who was sleeping in the kitchen, accompanied Millán.

When you open the door up Street, were the two brothers sitting in
the dining room next to Dona Manuela.

- Let's wait for Dad to sleep
- said Leocadia - lest we hear.

Spend some time left, Leocadia unbraided thinning hair meanwhile her mother, gathering with
a pair of forks, and then did the same with her long brown curls.

Pepe lit a cigarette and looked at the lamp, as having to use it
until late, then have no missing oil.

- Much writing, brother.

-
Yo, when I want someone I'm not like you, if you just Millán.

Well, look: their intentions can not be clearer. Tonight I have said that they lowered your
soon to open up when they imagined that he was coming, but, well, there you are. I think you're
not very expressive with it.

- Funny! You want me to eat it with their eyes? Not to be a stamp!

- Do not think you want to get you the groom from his eyes.

What I say is that although you lived a hundred years, would not
find a better one.

- Is it Prince?

- Yes, as you princess.

- Well,
son, you rather make love to a lady's car.

In this cabinet appeared to Dona Manuela.

- Children, already half asleep, we will talk soon four words, I'm
exhausted and I also sleep.

- Look, Mom, what is that talking is
little, but there is no other means to decide something.

The pharmacy takes a lot of money, you need to spend less on everything else. I'll make a work
for Don Luis, who fixed pay me well, but what it should not occur have until next month.

- Well, the first thing is to fire the girl, but not more than thirty
real, it's something.

Tomorrow will take it to pawn the quilt candeleritos Philippines and silver.

- What you should do is to remove part of daily spending - said Leo .-- Do not bring meat rather
than dad, and tell you to eat in your room to move less, then we come into the room, and so does
not know.

- I, with three packs a week I have enough.

In addition, Don Luis I get some cigars and to keep chopping. Would you have said something
at the store?

- Yes - said Leocadia - per dozen handkerchiefs pay, according to the drawing, twenty-four Thirty-six
reals, and I have to put whatever it takes.

- In summary - Pepe said crunching numbers with a pencil on the margins of correspondence,
and muttering mumble calculation figures - we pay hard twenty-seven
Dad, ten and eight of my salary is forty-five, and eight or ten be
given to it by the embroidery ... of fifty-three to fifty-four dollars
a month, removing the twenty, at least, that there to give the market
over the time, and the lack of tailor peak, will be about thirty four
dollars ... put a hard day for the cost of the house ... the pharmacy
is the one we lost.

- Well, son, that somewhere out there, and fourth
is wasted ... What would we do?

- Now, lie down, each in his own bed.

Leave me to myself, I think that Don Luis has to draw from trouble.

At least I have to ask a favor ... in short, who knows? Goodbye Mom and you, ugly cute face,
until tomorrow .-- And giving a kiss to each, gently threw the room. Took then the limelight
was in the kitchen, went with her to her room, returned with about a large binder ink, pens, paper,
envelopes and three or four books, and placing the best he could, sat at the table.

Until near dawn was taking notes of several books, writing in the
pages very cortitos paragraphs, as extracts, numbers followed by references
and citations.

That seemed paper prepared for that exploited other. As the clock near the stroke of three, the poor
boy's head was already heavy, uncertain view and a beautiful bust, sloping even to the table,
appeared in a cloud of smoke that had been left in the atmosphere Cigarette consumed the room,
whose ash, moved by the breath, hovered over the leaves of books. Still continued to fill pages
for a while, until the stiff Burning feet and forehead, gathered up the papers and put them
in one volume. Immediately took a plieguecillo for a letter, leaving a pensive moment as she
thought, "The write, if not see you tomorrow. " Then, searching for envelopes, and have between
them a larger and heavier, opened it, taking from him two or three letters and a portrait of women,
Mademoiselle de creased Leocadia car, and staring a moment, murmured: "How beautiful is! "Then,
without any noise distracted him, delivered with soul and life to your ideas, plieguecillo seized
and began to write:

Adoro Paz :...»

II

Pepe and Miller met in 1862, when at fourteen or fifteen years were enrolled in the Institute Novitiate
first Latin.

They were both then of little physical, but smart, handsome, ready without excess of mischief,
and without plenty of malice warned. In his feeble body servants Madrid poor homes, the prevailing
understanding of children educated alongside older people, without watching anything, speak
of all free. Pepe was thin, tall, lanky, with hair blond, curly and swirling, who claim to be
an indication of temper. Looking penetrating his eyes seemed to look at things, want to start
teaching them that springs; he was never tired of questions mouth or ears of responses: rather,
impatience showing bartered to interrogate you to listen quietly. Since childhood, unbelief instinctively
rejoice him less than other children with tales of witches, and being grown man, was always on our lips
how? and why? Like children who break toys to see what they have inside, he, following perhaps
a bit vulgar disposition, intended to be given explanation for everything, so, to deny what you
asked, it was necessary, at least simulate an argument, to convince, which was quiet and obedient.
His precocity was not the one consists in the early development of some faculties, but trial
in certain serenity that dominates over impressions, led him to reject what your understanding
is not enough. We had to explain everything, and he understood signal was a charming docility.
Never got a maid with giants amused that swallow raw meat, feats of thieves or enchanted princesses
wonderful adventures; but if you listened to his parents real events, vivid cases, something
that had true then with your eyes wide open, as they teach puppy treat, was still waiting
that the relationship ended, then to questions and more questions about what could not understand.
With a very mocking smile rejected what was repugnant to their childish ideas and Sometimes the
phrase that occurred to him, if not for the purpose, something had by intonation satire.

Miller was more simpleton, smaller, had less difficulty to deceive, and it was also given more
strength and Arriscado games.

The sap of life, as the former had reconcentrated in the brain, had taken in the second form
of physical energy. One was the race of those who think, another race of those who obey. Watching
them play together Pepe was willful, it seemed Miller bend to their whims, but to little are
observed, it was easy to notice that the passivity of this was but the implicit recognition
instinctive superiority of the former. In addition, Miller was very good nature and, as he pleases
it, revealed that, in matters of force was the advantage of you, in everything else Pepe was the lead.
In making wooden swords, cutting boards, run the hammer, jump to step, climb fences and walls to climb,
no competitor was Millán: to make awards condone pranks and avoid scolding, Pepe had special talent.
He knew to wait to ask time, let the first moments of anger, not to irritate the annoyance with
answers and evoke a favorable opportunity, the memory of the offering.

The beginnings of his friendship was a kind of pact against Latin and against this mode to teach
the language of Latium that was abhorrent to Virgil and Cicero.

Formed a mutual aid society to join the lesson, save work to translate, looking together the
meanings in the dictionary and responding, the roll call one by another, until came to gather
together the collection of postage stamps which by then was all boy Madrid. At first only saw
in the classroom or on the faculty of the Institute, which has Street entrance of the Kings,
then found their way to come home, and we walked together, expecting another in the plaza of Santo
Domingo, where he arrived almost at the same time. Millan lived on the square of the Screen;
Pepe on the streets of Buttons: Costanilla that came by the Angels; it down the street from
the scallops, then followed together to the Novitiate, stopping in as many windows had something
they called attention. Winter mornings bought donuts, summer evenings groundnuts, and all-weather
wimp, roe, or carob candies to farthing, but his delight was in sharing a pack of cigarettes, but
never arrived to fight over who spent quarter or so. During the first year kept the boys look
a little cramped raised among skirts and clean language, made no freedom to walk alone down
the street; but soon were opening ears to the malice and having ready for the shameless tongue: mischievousness
entróseles thought as infused knowledge, learned to swear, pegóseles some of that impudence
that is given step, and increase your vocabulary with phrases Achilles turns foul language and
whose meaning may not understand, imagine repeating such things that talking about fat men would
hint of panties. Not for this malearon, and those obscenities and suits that used to each other, but to
anyone they repeated, was like a mud that if I messed up the mouth, did not arrive to stain
the soul.

One morning she missed her class with a professor, went to other guys to play Mico was, and this loophole
was to them a revelation. From then on, when calculated that they could ask the lesson, went
to class, but most of the day, then passing list, slipped, or gum
pricking and staining the tissue, they pretended take bleed from nose
to let them out, denying the decline and hyperbaton Latin and for
older men who invented slander.

Dates from this period in history of his life long series of raids they did in Madrid, and
avoiding going through streets downtown where they could be hand to mouth at home who gave notice
of meeting. So they came to know every inch of few walks, roads and surrounding hills the Court,
leaving a foot you want for these rounds, as gentlemen marching Legend to see land and then had
to be home when Miller's father, and the Pepe's mother noticed that the boys broke shoes as if
they were to stubbornness. The famous Marco Polo in the old, and Livingstone and Stanley these
days, browsers were next to them of more or less. What greater issue to go from the novice to
the Iron Gate stopping at the Green Bridge to call them all! All! the washers of the river?
Why, and the trip to Amaniel Moratalaz or do the exercise for the troops? What about going
to ecstasy to the positions of San Isidro, on the eve of pilgrimage, or go in winter to see
if had frozen the Canal del Lozoya? What never occurred to them was taking sides in stoning
of the Peñuelas, see executed in Camp Guard or deal with the waffle that, game tape and stole money
from the provincials in the Principe Pio Mountains. In contrast, I enjoyed very much to see in the palace
stop or to stand on Santa Cruz listening to quacks rant from the driver's seat of a cab selling
lion to remove grease spots or saying powders having to kill the lone inset stomach, which is
the intestine where gets the food. And the wealth of knowledge they acquired? For some time became
addicted to mechanics, and every day they would see from a cutting put in turntables near North
Station, another season gave the construction, entertainment lift rocks to see new buildings,
then the industry showed fans, watching on the balconies of Rock Street guts of guts, and even
made comments involve manufacturing in Toledo Round matches with strips of cardboard out to dry
the sun. Madrid corner was not not see, from Camp Guard to the Prairie Canal, and from the Source
of Sales Teja to the Holy Spirit, or crossroads where no pass, one of his favorite pleasures
examine places of Madrid described in old novels, swashbuckling to fourth delivery, in which
learned to pieces and badly episodes that made them look at certain sites with a respect between
ridiculous and poetic, taking for granted that Felipe II witnessed the murder of Escobedo from
a portal the street from the Almudena, and commenting, as if they had attended the death of Villamediana
near San Ginés and the adventure in which Quevedo challenged a gentleman who had hit a slap a woman.
What was the difference between the enthusiasm with which they gained that Madrid sets dislocated erudition
and disdain with which they looked at the biographies Latino Cornelius Nepos and selected pieces,
which to them seemed the very essence of insufferable! A class of Geography and History of Spain
liked to go, but in Latin and Religion not cast eyes on them but on rainy days, they did not
know where to take the body. Pressed in April and May, early June and returned home examined
ovantes, with good note and the fright out of the body. In this way, walking a lot and studying
something, but his intelligence easily assimilated what they learned, became a compromise between
sorbedor student text, usually at the end to be useless, and lazy pigra, which degenerates into
rascal.

By 1868, he graduated from high school, and two young lady still casting compliments to the sewers,
and shortly after their families determined to give career. Both parents decided to study laws.
As Don Jose, who was the former Spanish and who had no serious profession but evidenced by academic degree,
greatly influenced the memory of respectability to eyes had the judges and magistrates of Chancery
and hearings as he walked from province to province as a humble employee. He was aware that it
had to cost many sacrifices, but yielded to the temptation to see his son made toga vuelillos
character. For him the law was the least: the lawyer said, could not imagine the guy defending
lawsuits but administering justice. Miller followed the example of Peter, as well as estimated
it did.

The real life of students would not last long. Both had to leave the race just started. The misfortune
was primed in a similar way home and the friendship of children, Founded in games and rides, was
closer bond that came to misfortune.

Miller's father in the slums had a small printing shop where do favor a friend, threw several
issues of a clandestine newspaper. One night he was surprised the police, and closing the
press took the owner to Saladero, where he remained, spending savings payment in a room until
September 29, mobs took him slightly less than success with other political prisoners. What he
could not return justice popular, energetic but late money was lavished on warders and guards
to avoid being disturbed, and the clerk to activate the cause, nor
the parish lost with the closure of printing.

When the poor man was released from prison, consumed his fortune, had to resign an officer as a
typesetter. His years was hit too hard, and a chronic condition had in his eyes got so serious
that it was impossible to continue working.

Millán hesitated about the determination to be followed, "- Father - he said - as I grew in
print, I know the office and everything in it is made. Look for me you work with my wages will be
for two, at least for you, I need some. "
