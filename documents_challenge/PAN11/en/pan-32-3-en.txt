 Against a pretext so inveterate do not know what remedy may be. The art of producing gold, Crisopeya
has been completely lost, and we have no more art or science that put our hope, to see if we removed
the hook, that political economy. God put in touch hands of those who know and apply it to the
management of state affairs. And not I hesitate to say that because of science. How can one
doubt, when science is, was and always will my love, though unhappy? I say to both that may
occur to some economists As with certain philologists who study a language, say, Chinese or
Arabic, so by principles, such recondidez grammar and so deeply, then no one understands, nor
do they understand each other, or fail to understand the true Chinese and Arabs by birth, declaim
against them, claiming that they are ignorant of the literary dialect or speech Mandarin, and do not
know their own language, but in a vernacular, routine and all unintelligible to scholars, but
the truth is that rather than lament, perhaps therefore not serve to dragomans.

Perhaps this explains the way, when I went traveling in a wild country,
I was right to explain what it was that a friend of mine, great engineer,
who insisted on guiding us with their science does not hit ever, and
we almost did not sink and buried in muddy puddles or we lost in dark
woods, where we had eaten the wolves.

I was always with the heart in her mouth, but not for a moment doubted the science. What I
argued was that this land was so rough yet, not understood the science and revealed against it.
Then returned to trust the leadership of our trip to the practical guide and lay it before we
had served and we, the term that we proposed.

Could happen, finally, consisting of political economy, if I remember correctly, several parties, such
as: the creation of wealth, its circulation, its distribution and consumption, we thoroughly
studied over here last party, and have rather neglected the study
of First, regarding it as impossible to learn anything, and saying
humble and Christian with the poet:

It's raising a job That only
God knows With its infinite power.

I live so sure of this truth, I never wanted engulfed in the mare-magnum of Political Economy,
having for so complicated this whole machinery of society, which even remotely have fallen into
the temptation to find out what are the springs that move and what
the basis on which it is based.

    I've always been afraid
    to come to events the
    economist as a child that moved from curiosity, toy breaks to see
what has inside.

My purpose in writing this obrilla is not, therefore, devise economically about money: give
lessons on the most readily available. Who knows, since So I find out if, despite my unblemished
philanthropy, I had to keep silence, at least for a few years, profiting from it for my private
use and the occasional another very beloved friend? My purpose is only to talk about the influence
that money exerts souls: that is, I do not treat here of Political Economy, but of moral philosophy,
exposing some philosophical thoughts about money, sometimes born of my own meditation, prayer
of the deep mind of the ancient and modern scholars I have consulted.
