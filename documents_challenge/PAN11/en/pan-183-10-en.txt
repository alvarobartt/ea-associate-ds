 I think the people of Seville are among the most beautiful
and rival those in Eastern Hungary and parts of Italy. The beauty found there is almost too much.
It is without the severity of the Spanish or the coolness of the
British or the artificiality-- to some degree intended-- of the French
or Valencia's harshness.
