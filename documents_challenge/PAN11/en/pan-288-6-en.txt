 It was then, amid turmoil always produce
new perspectives, radical changes in the course of life, when I realized my love for the people
so open and generous hospitality I had given. And it was certainly unique sense of my personal
gratitude: it was somewhat higher, was the deep affection for this society that spoke of my country
with a marked predilection above all nations of the continent and had wanted to honor me the representative
of Argentina land.
