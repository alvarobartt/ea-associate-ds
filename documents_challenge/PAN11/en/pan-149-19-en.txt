 If
she could not instill the idea of ??forgiveness, if his memory was ineffective, the fault was entirely
of that man.

In the early days, candle plant had not even raised the moral issue at that time increased his torment.
But when the first momentum of the pain began to subside naturally, as he had to get used to
so fatal to the idea of ??death as all the forces of his soul were concentrated to collect,
to guard, to immortalize the memory of being that had moved away never to return, his mind
began to point the reflection of whether the death that would blend of blind hatred and his
desire for revenge. At the instant the bullet across his murderous meats, closed his eyes to
