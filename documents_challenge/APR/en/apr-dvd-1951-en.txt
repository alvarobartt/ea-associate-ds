i discovered this gay film festival from october 08. at the beginning of the screening i thought that was a turnip, then the movie set i was more excited, then moved to tears. i have never stopped me get it. music, schubert, homosexual men, the handsome, germany, snow hearings (short) of schubert's music all that enchanted me. finally i get it. i get it. i reregarde. and then my enthusiasm falls at once: i found this film boring and i mortally much yawned. i understand now that i had not understood the film and the plot is thinner than it had appeared at first viewing. finally the story is very simple and the concert included songs added and appear unrelated to the story. so, ultimately, disappointment.
