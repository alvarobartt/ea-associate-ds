after seeing crouching tiger, hidden dragon, hero, the house of flying daggers, the princess of the desert, it is better not to see this movie. wanting to compete with the lord of the rings, the film multiplies the effects (often unnecessary and badly done), and the actors seem completely dispossessed characters. the sets, meanwhile, feel the cardboard visibly and implementation is noisy. a very big disappointment.
