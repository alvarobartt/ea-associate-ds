well yes, this dvd is simply a disgrace! big fan of the band since the beginning, i ran on this reissue given the date (2008) i told myself how lucky remastered it will be a bomb, as in the box "led zeppelin" there were previews beautiful of these dates in 1975 earl's court, and then the collapse, not a sharp image, it is not clear when the figure of jimmy, robert is still unclear, the sound of her voice is sometimes inaudible, it is even an insult to these 4 musicians of genius, why such an issue? however the new version of "the song remains the same" 2008 is 100 times better then the gentlemen publishers made an effort ... a dvd quality is not free!
