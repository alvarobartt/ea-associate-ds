debut album for chevelle makes this album with a beautiful entrance, also the first song "open" is aptly named and leads us into a universe, certe neometal but a small side "toolien" and "grungy" makes them really original. note nevertheless, the presence of steve albini at the controls, sorry ... i also recommend their albums that followed, which produced a major, gaining power sound ...
