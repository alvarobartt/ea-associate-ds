i was much a fan of sepultura (until 1996), first provided this soulfly cavalera conspiracy album is bad, nothing original, all pieces are alike, the riffs are always the same, igor would be replaced by a drum machine that we would not see the difference as his game is flat and max does not really voice it must be admitted ... in short, choose the album sepultura, then you will not be disappointed.
