i write because i am very surprised by the negative comments of the reader who left a review on this site. in fact, i consider the work of traven as absolutely essential, and this novel in particular. with great clarity and ferocity of good quality, traven depicts the hellish world of stateless persons of low degree, sentenced to spend their lives on dirty vessels since all governments deny them asylum because of their lack of identity papers. we sailed and from ship to ship, one hell to another hell, to the exhaustion of men and ships. book very readable but desperate, scathing criticism of our government inhumane (the book dates from the early 20th century), i recommend the ship of the dead to all without hesitation. while the book is more of a pamphlet that the adventure story. with the treasure of the sierra madre, probably the best book of its author. also recommended: rosa blanca, the bridge in the jungle and the revolt of the hanged. essential reading!
