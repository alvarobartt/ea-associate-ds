difficult to talk about music "vocal" about this cd as the sound is outrageously "rigged." means not vote, but looks like a gas whenever the singers opened the cd is bouche.ce range rather then in the "ambiente". if you love beautiful voices select the album of french vox angeli.d especially since, contrary to what some people say it is not plagiarism at all since these two realizations come from the same box of disks (sony bmg). in addition to the repertoire of vox angeli is higher than that of angelis.
