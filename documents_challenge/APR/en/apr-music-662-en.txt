the reissue of this live (soundtrack) may seem initially a little push. a few years ago, when the first edition cd, i discovered a cd containing a single concert at the wrong sound could have only historical value. a reissue of this double live without real novel, one could say it was a little unnecessary ... but here, at first listen, one wonders if it has to do the same concert. the sound was remastered by tony visconti himself to the legendary abbey road studios. and there was a real feeling of being on stage with the spiders from mars. the bombast of a song like time takes all its glory, the songs become more dynamic and more "wild eyed boy from freecloud / all the young dudes / oh you pretty things" is simply sublime. this disc finally restores the last concert of ziggy stardust and i urge all fans of 70s rock.
