frankly i almost cried with fear for the film, because beside high voltage scream trilogy can pack up ... like many people i have not understood the purpose and would like if possible an explanation !? suspense is at its height, there is blood everywhere, still recovering from a murder that another arises ... we have no time to breathe for about 1:40 frankly ... bravo to the actors and director for this movie is really gory ... it's nice to see a horror movie really french succeeded! to see any urgency ... but not entirely alone in a house far from the road and especially at night! (friendly advice lol)
