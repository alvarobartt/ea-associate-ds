without the breath of the best hathaway (i think, at or majestic) nor that of john ford in the classic, the american director martin ritt (1920 to 1990) offers us a beautiful film on the theme of racism, l man facing his word against his own betrayals, lies and theft. "hombre", produced in 1967, is steeped in humanities. in the late nineteenth century, john russell (well camped by paul newman) white high among the apaches of the san carlos reservation, will suffer from racial discrimination when it comes to recover his inheritance, a gold watch and an old motel. arrived, dressed as a cowboy in his motel, he faces the manager, jessie (the superb actress diane cilento) he "thanked" immediately taking the decision to sell the motel cons of horses. just the beginning. a final dispatch. closed session between a young couple, an outlaw, a couple who governed in his way the famous indian reservation san carlos, a mexican driver, the former manager and the man who calls himself "hombre" (paul newman). what are the mysteries permeating the atmosphere increasingly heavy this trip? film generous feelings, much to the action taken, it gives man a noble image, that of selfless action before the danger of death . this film is beautiful.
