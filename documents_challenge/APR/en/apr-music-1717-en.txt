"ambient" was released in 1993, and we noticed a moby young and hairy on the wafer, which is quite hilarious! except here, the music is calm, relaxing and planing. the first track "my beautiful blue sky" is one of my favorites. the rest is the future: all instrumental tracks, often short (1 min 30). however, this album will not remain in the annals of music. few songs really shine, unlike other albums by moby, as "living" to "animal rights" or "god moving over the face of waters" of "everything is wrong." however, this album is recommended for those who want to listen to the gentle and soothing electro and unadorned, listening eg taking a bath very relaxing! in short an album interesting, fairly equal throughout the titles, which i think deserves 3.5 stars.
