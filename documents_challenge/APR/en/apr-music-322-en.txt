if the intention is good (to mix electronic music and jazz), the result is particularly disappointing. what one enjoys priority in jazz is the improvisation and freedom that it enjoys in electronic music, the beat and audacity. but here it is sorely lacking. for the real experiment and a fusion of quality, it is better to turn to the underground scene in new york or in european jazz. it remains, however, that this disc may be ideal for sound to a bathroom or for use as background music during dinner by candlelight.
