simultaneously with the release of this film came a clone, or almost: deep impact, and it is ten times much better. armageddon is quite pitiful caricatures of characters we do not believe for one second. where there is emotion in deep impact, it makes the humor in armageddon. despite some good scenes, spectacular enough, this film is appalling. as mentioned previously, there are big ways, but the movie disappoints. it is a pity that the reputation of key actors (bruce willis, ben affleck) has cleared another film of the same kind but he actually managed the remarkable "deep impact".
