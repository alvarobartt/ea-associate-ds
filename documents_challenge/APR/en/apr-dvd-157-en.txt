there are things that must always be at hand when you have children: cakes, some toys, colored pens and a few well-chosen dvd. the jungle book 2 is part of the required as winnie the pooh, babar, noddy ... children love it and watch it repeatedly (but how do they do?). this film is very well done although a little short. the music is catchy and the characters are endearing. tip: also buy the cd to listen in the car, your children will appreciate. handle with caution however because it does not forget that the design or rides bikes are also good distractions.
