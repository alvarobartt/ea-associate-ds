humor "woody allen" is still there, but it is here (not always) in a dramatic context that moderates feel strongly that we usually smile when he saw our actor-director well beloved. but ultimately the parallel plots, which occupy all the nuances of funny to tragic, marry harmoniously. the matter of conscience judd rosenthal (martin landau) is beautifully rendered. in short, an overall tone quite rare woody allen, but if you still want to find a brother in this film, we do not deceive you, i think he saying he announces "match point".
