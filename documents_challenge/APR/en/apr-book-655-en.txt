what would this book (for a first child for example). he never leaves the bedside table. it opens if need ... to be read by dad absolutely (especially when mom is breastfeeding and she believes it should always be fed at night to calm your baby)! it avoids many inborn errors. i offer to my friends at every birth of a first child! tested and widely endorsed. i recommend you also book on breastfeeding by the same author.
