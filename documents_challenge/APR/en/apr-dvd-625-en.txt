the first part was great but the end was somewhat problematic. both say right now is still somewhat the case. the film is exciting and the actors are great, jean reno is, as always, charismatic, and benoit magimel managing to forget vincent cassel partner in shock. the staging is very upbeat, the action scenes are spectacular, all bathed in a dark and oppressive atmosphere, in short, this film is well in line with the first and is therefore highly recommended!
