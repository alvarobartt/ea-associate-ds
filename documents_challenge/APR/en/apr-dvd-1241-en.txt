the only thing saving this "movie?" is all the extra goodies on the dvd's. however those goodies can only count for so much. the animation is impressive, maybe not as impressive as advertised goal none the less impressive. the characters look like they must have sucked their thumbs as children. unfortunately the story is not so impressive. it looks like it was contrived just for the graphics. what was the buzzing in the background? on it was someone's idea of background music that played over and over (sort of cartoonish its self). i would be more elaborate goal there is not too much to elaborate on. a better title would have been "gag me gia" or "ghost toast"
