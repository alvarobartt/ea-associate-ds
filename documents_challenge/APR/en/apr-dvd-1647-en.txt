the dubbing actors is ensured by other doublers than the original version. the replicas are sometimes slightly modified. translations do not always stick to the french text, it is not new, but "27 billion" instead of "28 billion" is to neglect (not being a purist). the bonus: in english without subtitles. result: a bitter taste for what should be an improved version, we regret the original version!
