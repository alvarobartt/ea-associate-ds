why is a sequel to "the matrix"? the film, which was revolutionary for the film (although the cyberpunk literature was already well past the subject a few decades ago, actually inventing anything new ...) should never have taken on. on the original film, we move to a suite without flavor, with special effects even more, even more impressive, and blablabla ... in short, we wanted to do more, but they forgot that the scenario should take the road following a film if "original" (if you look at the history of the first, it does not break bricks. but forgive him because he changed the face a little film) so what is there in this new opus? a story that continues, a little more sex, the arrival of new characters including monica bellucci, who like many of his films seen relegated to flowerpot ... shall we ever performance as an actress? unfortunately, the wachowski brothers were unable to renew itself and i believe the public has responded well to that ...
