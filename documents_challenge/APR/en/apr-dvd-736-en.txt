this war film directed by werner herzog was inspired by a true story. we find the talent director from 1965 to the eve of the war in vietnam. during a secret mission, dieter dengler (superbly played by christian bale), a pilot u.s. naval aviator, was shot down over laos during a secret mission. held in the jungle, the enemy viet cong and allies lao, inflicts the worst torture and humiliation. determined to fight for its survival, dengler organized the escape ... the man is free until his last breath. it is of course a courage and extraordinary determination to want to say, day after day, in order to escape, "rather die a slave." heroic examples we have are mentioned from time to time. i think jean moulin, who died of torture he suffered, certainly, but victorious, free. this film is great. it demonstrates the truth of the required total commitment to freedom. superb.
