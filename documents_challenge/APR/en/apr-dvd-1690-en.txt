for those who also like the ambience of film / portraits of women such as p.exe "a woman under the influence" by john cassavetes (with equally great, great forgiveness and unforgettable gena rowlands), "an angel at my table" jane campion, or "scenes of married life" by ingmar bergmann ... (to mention only those that come instantly to mind).
