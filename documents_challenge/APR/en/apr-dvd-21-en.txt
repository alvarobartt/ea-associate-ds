a comedy incredibly well put together, with a backdrop of mafia junkie english to die laughing ... the characters are excellent and worth the detour, the dialogues in english are fabulous and the story is, in my opinion, a true reference. the terrible and foxtail are always intelligently defused. in short, "etc. scams." should be part of any self-respecting dvd library!
