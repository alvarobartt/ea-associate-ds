the end of the film is fake, jean pierre marielle is the big deception, there was some material to make bob morlok and he plays macbeth, the tragic killing by the film when we could make a good poelade! victor lanoux is much better, it is you say ... we feel that there are two full under the pedal. but the director has decided otherwise. damage. blame it on rio the remake with michael caine is just hilarious. i advise.
