nicholson fan, i was rushed to the cinema to see this movie surrounded by good reviews. the simple scenario, a widower in search of itself hinting at a good time. indeed, there are quite a small sarcastic replies that jack is an evil (his) pleasure in pronouncing the sidelong glance. however, this movie just along to find his rhythm. it is too slow and not rebounding. too bad :-( i was expecting a sort of auntie danielle bear version "male" licked in vain ... the voltage drops very quickly and it almost looks forward to the death of mr. schmidt. finally, one might even thank nicholson play. the actor carries the whole film. alas, the structure was too thin. the weight of years is felt in this film too winded.
