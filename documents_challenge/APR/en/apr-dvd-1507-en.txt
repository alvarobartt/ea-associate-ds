trevor garfield (samuel l. jackson) teaches in a school in brooklyn, where violence has already passed through the gates. it will include the day he will be brutally assaulted by a student that will have to turn to play with their rules if it wants to survive. a relatively good film in which the supply of samuel l jackson is still brilliant, as usual. as long as you love this kind of movie, there is no reason to be bored.
