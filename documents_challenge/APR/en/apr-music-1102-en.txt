well ok, i haven t even heard the album, but after attending a concert by chris and his group la cigale (paris), i must admit i am somewhat puzzled. the entirety of the album was played at the beginning of the concert, so that c is a trial was the first listen ... but rather a decision in half shade. indeed, for those who are not yet aware, the most beautiful voice of grunge (if indeed that term has any meaning) s is a crony to write and produce this new album with ... timbaland! ... as you say that it is (very) near or d. rather than soundgarden or, this work provides a chris de s try in a register tres ... kanye west, rihanna or beyonce, r &amp; b, therefore, not the best (one wonders how moreover d is the ratio between the artwork and the disc). probably in to the picnic with a few (very light) buttons guitars were added here and there. c is a pity because on stage the group is far to be armed as we can check on jesus christ pose, hunger strike, loud love or outshined played an encore, but unfortunately absent from the album. on the way, icing on the cake he s acts of a concept album (s bind songs without white) and "take me alive" is justin timberlake who has put his flow ... c there is not beautiful ca?!
