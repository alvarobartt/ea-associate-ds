this book is the claim we suggest the 1001 album that you absolutely must listen ... before dying! however, before buying this volume, it is essential that you know that - contrary to its universalist pretensions - the book covers virtually do that (95%!) the growing anglo-saxon music lover. i have nothing against the culture and the anglo-saxon - far from it! - but i hate the false representation. however, the title of this book is extremely misleading because it suggests that covers the entire music of humanity, and _c'est totally faux_. for example, georges brassens is missing! but how can you pretend to die without ever having heard brassens?? :-d more seriously, this book is the very representation of ethnocentrism and navel gazing anglo-saxon. no, the artists are not anglophone! yes, this book is extremely disappointing in that it sets forth an overall culture is not more than 6% of the global population - as if anglophonie represented over 90% of humanity. if you are looking for a simple anglo-saxon musical anthology, it should suit you. however, do not rely primarily on this work to offer universal coverage and humanistic music.
