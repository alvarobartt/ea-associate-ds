perhaps i took a shot of old, yet i listen to music, and in all genres. i must say that i have three children at home, including two teenagers, but now the cd has is one quarter of an hour on the turntable, and eject. i hate that i scream in the ears. so surely as the lady she sings well, surely that arrangements are in hair and that everyone has bent over backwards to make this cake makes a good turnover, but someone who is clearly consistent demonstration of vocal power does not interest me. it's not that the music for me. out of respect for the arranger and brilliant discoveries: a star is all it deserves.
