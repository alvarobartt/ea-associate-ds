"atomic bomb ",... i do not know if i need to put a star because i did not understand (although i read a lot) or 5 stars to convince you to buy it, to perhaps clarify my lantern! let me explain: the book itself is really well written, the authors have a style is undeniable, and imagination! the novel is very funny, the back cover in no exaggeration, it's really a great eaten air (or smoke for lovers) when the bed! however, i see no shading, no story per se, but maybe it comes from me too. it follows the adventures of 2 old and crazy junkies who decide to end their day by launching a wave of the blast of an atomic explosion, surfboard in hand! they seem then to be reincarnated (or dream or split personality?) successively extraterrestrial pear-shaped and rats preparing the attack of the century the headquarters of nintendo ... imagination, there are, but understand that? even if i knew there was still the story, plot, or moral, something anything! if this was precisely the aim of these 2 young writers, then i do not like it disjointed and uninteresting to me. otherwise, the style is so catchy that i do not deprive myself of reading the next novel they come out hoping they correct the shot!
