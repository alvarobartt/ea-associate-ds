so frankly, leaves me to put fans back in this series (with teeth), i would point out the mediocrity of this series. the vampires and other monsters roam and no one is surprised and it always ends with shots of latte. interpreters are ghostly and achievement worthy of a tv series (ah, slim it is, i am told). all this gives me no desire to use a pole but rather go to the stake (i'm funny).
