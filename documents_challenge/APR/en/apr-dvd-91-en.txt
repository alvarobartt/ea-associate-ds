the main character from the beginning, not at all credible in his role. having nothing of the seducer, seems a bit backward and a complex personality, it's hard to imagine that two young beauties can go after him. but hey! the film is boring and tasteless, like what the critics of specialists can be at odds with those of an informed public. in short, a purchase that i regret, and a film that i do not see myself looking twice.
