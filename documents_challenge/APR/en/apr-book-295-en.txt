i read this book without having read anything about it, and it was a great discovery; faces like sartre, journalists libe, the cause of the people, the lives of authors, publishers, and sometimes stories that do not seem very clear, and this is its charm. a good book, without compromise, without waiting to be taken. a surge of guts.
