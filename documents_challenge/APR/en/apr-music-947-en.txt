no i have not heard the album but given that they have played almost the entire route of the rock (and thus ignore the number of their old titles casualty) i would notice. smashing the well in 2007 is certainly more c but c metal is mostly very boring and tiring on the length. it is clear for me that the disk will not be part of my club.
