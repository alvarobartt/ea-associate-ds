but what happened? it's true that can not be on top all the time. after all, maiden released their xfactor, helloween's chameleon, and with the fight for the cock, savatage another hit. finally justly :-) what has been pushing the group out like a dung? it speaks of the producer at the time, ok why not. still, there are means to do good things, even in the soothing words or by "selling" a little. here is just the stew, and if the song title and one or two others to save (but still far from standrad savatage), it does not back the level of the fight for the pork. the sanitized guitars, singing all cute, smooth and prod a half recoveries / b sides out of closets make fork fight for the album incredibly bad and it is a textbook case on what not to do. fortunately this fiasco did not kill the group, and we even the impression that this accident has given a path of excellence director for opus to follow. every calamity is a good thing!
