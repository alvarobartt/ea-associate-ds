i'm a crazy old films of boris karloff and there but frankly, even as a fan berserk, now that i saw this movie, well i can tell you that i would not have missed if i had not seen. the script is ridiculous and not credible for a penny, karloff is returning to die from laughing so much it is ridiculous. except for a very low price, it does not worth to buy it. i confirm that there is no french audio on the dvd, just english and french subtitles.
