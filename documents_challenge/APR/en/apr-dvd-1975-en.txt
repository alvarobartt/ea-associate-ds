it is a pity that the scenario is too easy. the idea of arthur (known producer) to give the story the key "dr j and mr love" is more than warm, the end is pathetic as can be, i was bad for the actors who play really perfection. only the idea of teens lingered so endearing is very good. pity, because the character was there and cyprien have had to give a very good film. otherwise, the blu ray quality level is correct, no more (screen 117) a few flaws compression unforgivable for a b ray film with a half past one et with a single audio track!
