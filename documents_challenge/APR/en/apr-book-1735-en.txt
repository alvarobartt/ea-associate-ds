i was not expecting much from this volume because after all what could happen there it interesting before the grand finale of volume 7? well i was wrong, because not only this volume is most excellent but also has won the number 1 (tied with volume 3) top of my volumes of harry potter! by cons i am surprised to read criticism presented above (that of the website): lack of humor? i've laughed a lot in this book! many dead? it seems to me that above all, her death is important, but otherwise i do not remember so many dead (quite the volume 7, which cleaned up the characters!). one must ask then, if we read the same book ... no, volume 6 is fascinating in every respect. it discovers all the secrets of voldemort and at the same time, the amorous intrigues multiply with some (long overdue), which change significantly. i usually prefer the side "of everyday life hogwarts" to the main plot around voldemort but here, the two plots are also successful one than the other! i would even say that after having read this volume if successful, is ultimately the volume 7 me somewhat disappointed ... comme quoi! nb: for info, i read all the volumes of hp 4 to 6 times each. when one loves ...
