what a nice christmas present that we do our favorite australian .... a magical album with 13 beads, unstoppable melodies, text "made in france" worn by the magical and bewitching voice of tina and a very good meeting with mr. salvador. my tires weigh: i'm baghdad, another world there are days i want to know .. the cd is looping in my charger and once you get caught you .. leave the magic hat and the artist
