in 1997, after the splendid "young team", i saw mogwai in the future (or at least a possible future) of rock. alas, this is a fairly disastrous disk, where the young ex-prodigies seem unable to do anything but drool over and over again their revenue from songs (with, as an extreme example, the song n Â° 2). one thing that i feared already with "ep +2": mogwai can more than s'autoparodier group on autopilot, without soul, punk below the content that he took at the beginning. i do not criticize the fading sound, but their laziness to take the agreements they issue almost since their inception. still young and already senile, how sad ... fold up on slint and "spiderland" 1991 is a completely different outfit.
