beautiful film that tackles a subject not easy for a somewhat confusing at first, but i liked bcp. i acknowledge that the "kind" can not make revenue from the general public, like some movies where he saves the world and is more closer to "the pursuit of happiness" as "independence day", or else another of his films that i loved "the legend of bagger vance." this film is sobering and that i liked to do it that way.
