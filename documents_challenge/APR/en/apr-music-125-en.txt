strange that this case "transformer" that almost everyone likes, that was a big commercial success on his release and gave the only hit of the career of lou reed's "walk on the wild side". second solo album was produced by david bowie and mick ronson's accomplice, their goal: to help a former star underground (incidentally one of the idols of the english) became a has-been completely re-emerged, using it for the glam wave then in full flood. and indeed, the material of the new yorker is very good quality of songs like "vicious" and "perfect day" is evident, consistent with this enormous talent of one of the best songwriters of his generation . the problem is the sound outfit wanted by bowie and ronson, both arrangements that production. the team applied by the winning recipes of "hunky dory" now, if it suited very well to the aesthetics and sophistication of bowie, it serves many of the tracks on this disc, as reed had managed to become an expert in sarcasm and evil (including the ballads). this is particularly true in the guitars, before key here supplemented or supplanted by saxes, conterbasses, violins ... the result, unconvincing, became even when comparing two versions of "satellite of love" in that of the album, slow ballad for piano and chorus, all too fluffy is reached, in the version that appears on the box set "peel slowly and see" by the latest incarnation of the velvet underground, there is a song and purified dynamic vocals by lou block, and reached in 3 minutes flat summit of a kind of pop music all ages combined. anyway, lou reed hates this album (not his songs). this is understandable: most of the time, it feels to hear it do its best to imitate david bowie. too bad.
