top 78. while the planned australian tour is canceled for lack of visas for cliff williams and roadies english (!!!) between the group in february to albert studios with vanda &amp; young at the controls. 4 / 5 weeks and here "powerage"! the favorite album by malcolm young (and mr keith richards of the stones), the more bluesy and also undoubtedly one of the least known. "sin city", "down payment blues," "gone shooting", "riff raff" ... ums are real and have some of the most beautiful blues group. first studio album with cliff williams. this edition, remastered, and beautiful book, make a little more an absolute must. indispensable. 10/10
