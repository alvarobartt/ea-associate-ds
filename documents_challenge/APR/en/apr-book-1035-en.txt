we felt coming in already "all monsters", but this volume provides confirmation: tardi not know what to tell, then the coup, he invented anything to prolong the adventure less extraordinary adele white sec. god knows i loved this series (until "drowned two heads"), but there is no longer possible. there is no scenario is disconnected, it turns in circles. and the worst part is that there will be a sequel ... what a mess!
