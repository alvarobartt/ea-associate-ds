in my case, this film has too many historical errors that i appreciate. i am fully aware that this is a tv movie and not a documentary but the liberties taken by the script are much too important. - bishop cauchon has never been the spiritual adviser of king charles vii in chinon (sacrilege!). in addition, he was appointed bishop of beauvais in 1920, 9 years before the arrival of jeanne to chinon. - the brother of joan of arc did not die during the assault on paris. - jeanne d ' arc was burned at the stake may 30, 1931. i find it a bit much to think of the scene under the snow. okay, it was at rouen, but anyway! also, where are the characters such as the duke of alencon, gilles de rais, jean d'aulon ... ? regarding count dunois, it is just mentioned. in short, this tv movie is a disappointment, a story rosewater based on the character of joan of arc.
