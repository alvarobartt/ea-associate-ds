the infinimondes: universes born from the imagination of man over the centuries and become accessible. our protagonist is a basically a tourist in search of thrills, tempted by the famous travel in infinimondes so beautifully presented on posters travel agencies. this book is his diary, written as a result thereof. you catch a smile at his ignorance, surprise, disbelief, fear panic over the pages. not this poor man would have imagined such an adventure! then he finally wins insurance on her own surprise, and exceed, our greatest pleasure! we discover in the pages of the fabulous destiny thédric, its meetings with the various peoples of the kingdom, especially one who does all the interest the book has my taste: an elf, lizlide. this elf is so enigmatic, so reserved, so mysterious, it is all a pure delight for the reader. a trip that should have been for a walk thédric tourism will eventually turn into participation in the war of a world he does not belong and which, unwittingly, it represents a major challenge. everything is taking in this book both the mundane nature, awkward and endearing to our hero, the descriptions of each character which is also attached, or the sequence of events which only increases our captivation! the end of history is surprisingly well tied! in conclusion, i think this book has qualities that! "fantastic journey" is really a well chosen title!
