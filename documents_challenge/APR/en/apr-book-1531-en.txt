i expected a lot from this book but i was very disappointed by its religious aspect, because it was not at all what i was looking for. from the opening pages we learn that the author is a protestant minister, while there is no reference on the cover and book presentation. therefore, if you're not convinced by the existence of god and if you do not intend to convince you, this book is not for you because in his advice, the author brings to any faith in god and prayer.
