i bought this dvd after reading the previous praise. i am very disappointed. this film is long, very hollow. i had not seen his exit, but now i think it's really outdated. al pacino plays a jerk, show-off, macho, to rocco siffredi, small strikes. pitiful. we do not believe for a minute. moments supposed to be dramatic ring hollow and false. boring. it's full of cliches that have been staged in a much more credible by others: the working mother and proud, the sister who leaves pervert the macho pique that his sweetheart to his boss, the forfeiture of kaid addict etc.. no, i did not work. there remain some splendid images in decor. but it is not a movie.
