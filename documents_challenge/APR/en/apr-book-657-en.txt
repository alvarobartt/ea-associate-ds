here, i offer this book for christmas to all my friends around .... those who undertake and are already facing difficulties, those who have ideas to make but do not know how to materialize, those who hesitate to change his life and especially those who are not convinced that we have everything in your hands to change the world. i found this book wildly rejoicing, bringing adventure to the 4 corners of the earth and hopes fair caring for all of us human beings, animals and plants ... sylvain darnil and matthew le roux out of school trade ... they are a generation where everything suggests they will be content to participate in the immense commerce of the world .. but no ... thinking is deep, supportive, intelligent ... and going looking for those we never talk about ... those who are fundamentally honest and whose life is guided by love, not fear. whoever you are, reading this book, you turn away from all sluggish world trade and the poorly publicized!
