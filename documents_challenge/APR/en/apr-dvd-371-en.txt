battlestar galactica "is, of course, already a cult hit! ... but it is above all that we can say, much more than a tv series and more that a space adventure! like star trek, but also a human adventure on the edge of space ... but where star trek is very successful at highlighting interesting stories of life in each episode, battlestar galactica prefers creating suspense all along of the same story, continuing over 4 seasons. this therefore allows a "battlestar" to take time to build a very complex scenario, which is based on characters with real depth human. do not worry, therefore, the consistency of all, because the care has been taken in producing, music and details in the scenery, we often reach heights in terms of wealth screenplay. a real pleasure! table, or rather i should say the fresco, that is "battlestar galactica" becomes literally epic, powerful and amazing power! in my opinion, it is worth noting that it is rare tv series that we provide as much material on which it is possible to think ... the questions are all there! ... thus, some passages have a genuine metaphysical intensity .. ".. a series extremely well done therefore, and as fine and intelligent! propulss√©e excellently by the pilot episode over 2h, "battlestar" is at the heart of the seasons, with a strong sense of "drama", a real "mythological fables", highlighting the human characters, engaging, complex and colorful !!!.. not to mention the action! "battlestar galactica": truly, a great adventure! great art! "thanks to the writers and directors for such moments! and also to all the fans of this series!
