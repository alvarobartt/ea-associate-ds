this novel is not a police officer as the cover of the book in paperback might suggest. it is a magnificent novel of atmosphere. i never make a summary of the book in my criticism, the publishing house does much better than me. just two sentences to situate the story: a single police officer must ensure the morgue of a hospital the body of mira hidley (real person-girlfriend of a serial killer 60 years in england and cover photo). the officer then took custody passive noon which will be punctuated appearance of the ghost of the killer (he is a victim of its imagination?) which raises disturbing questions, he also revisits his past and envisions a future family crises. it poses existential questions: why is this woman she has become a monster? everyone has not one black face, dark? the style is simple but powerful, the chapters are short, reading is therefore very pleasing. but as the novel is filled with flashbacks, returns to this and expectations of the future, i recommend reading the book not split, ie the understanding of this history may be difficult. this book is in paperback at a reduced price. a major success story in the novel kind of atmosphere.
