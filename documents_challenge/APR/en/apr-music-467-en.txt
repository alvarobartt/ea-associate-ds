this first solo album (released in 71) of the former lead singer of psychedelic band the zombies is a real masterpiece of baroque pop and intimate. wrought melodies, shimmering string arrangements, acoustic guitars, flutes, harps and harpsichords are wonderfully clear voice and delicate colin blunstone. so many ingredients that make "one day" a beautiful and timeless record that will appeal to fans of pop silverware (as burt bacharach) as the fanatics of nick drake or tim buckley.
