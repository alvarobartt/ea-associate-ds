a great novel that i devoured with relish. the clouds, i have always regarded with curiosity and a sort of affection. some do not deserve it and our earth, where each coin has two sides ... the author demonstrates a thorough knowledge of atmospheric processes, their physical intimacy. we may be surprised by a "literary". the formulation is written very pleasant at any time i wanted to "burn" pages. the "red thread", the cloud, we made first meet luke howard, their friendly inventor (at least one who has to distinguish, identify, giving them an identity), then we walk through the wide world, a coast to coast, in the footsteps of phileas fogg (like almost fog!) of the cloud. the eminent specialist loses the thread a little, without losing the north, on the contrary, since it finds itself. it's a bit disconcerting at first, he cracked open other mysteries that had eluded him until then but reveal themselves to him by analogy with fractals. i just thought the da vinci code. a book very readable, very dense, which makes looking up to heaven, think about some vanities, presents beauty, essentially the heart of life.
