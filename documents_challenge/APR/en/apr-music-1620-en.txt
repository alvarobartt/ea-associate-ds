advantage of the vinyl format is to have the original sleeve, ie small sided mickeys soldiers leave the trenches and charge by mouth (should understand), and inside, because that it opens those mickeys with smile towards the picture of the group and what group! they are all installed in table 5 before a birthday cake (report under "at your birthday party) bottles in hand and not mugs keuchtinvente: goldy john mac keyboard afro falling on her eyes, michael monarch ganster genre latin retro, nick st nicholas christie chic, jerry edmonton bell messed up and then the voice of the group, somewhat sprawling, john kay, they are rather the mug, must say it was not abba and steppenwolf ... then good part of the party is not really pleasing because just burn out in the decor especially the gear ... takavoir apart from this photo you can see inside the box when you order the cd, c is huge, it's not beautiful, not easy to talk without falling into clich√©s: you know born to be wild, possibly magic carpet ride, monster, or do sookie sookie stepp sat on the grass, but this cake is not discussed too curious. it's rough but melodic ( "jupiter child"), aggressive and locomotiviel ( "do not cry"), but pleasing, funny ( "chicken wolf") really inventive while remaining rock running, efficient and aggressive.
