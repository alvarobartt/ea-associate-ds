operation: mindcrime is a great album, the masterpiece of the group. operation: mindcrime ii is a good album of melodic hard rock, very varied, well played and well produced, but not transcendent. queensr√øche the first opus was different from today (i think the inspiration was more exuberant at times!). this album is fun and enjoyable listening, but it's probably the type cd to listen for several times to appreciate its true value.
