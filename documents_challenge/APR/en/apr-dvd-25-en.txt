it's still nice to see films like that from time to time, action, thrills, emotions, everything is there. i was looking for this movie for many years, having seen him as a teenager. i love to relive all that time, the daredevil pilots and bold new technology that defied all imagination for the time. say what you want, it's still as addictive and magical. for those who love him, try 'the dish' with sam neill, who tells the story of australian observatory, which broadcast live the first steps of man on our beautiful moon.
