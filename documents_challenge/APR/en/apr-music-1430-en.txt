unlike many, i love this album, like all the others too ... the first 3 tracks, a new energy carried by the arrival of soundgarden drummer put us quickly in appetite. then the securities' s bind without tiring, always as poignant and emotionally charged. "thin air," "nothing as it seems" and "light years" is my favorite ...
