i have not adhered to this movie because of the choice made by the director to plunge his story in a sea of melodramatic effects. in addition to a real (and painful) heaviness, this choice involved a bias upon a facet of the character (the romantic). with more sober, he would have been interesting to let the viewer appreciation on less brilliant facets of the main character as insanity or some form of contention. it's my opinion at least, we may have seen a story about the denial of self and an ode to nature. for my part i see a biased story a bit heavy.
