in a couple, the man must be taller than his wife, failing which his manhood take quite a blow, to everyone, including his children. so what about the beautiful leon, 1.66 m., married to solange shiny, 1.80 m., which continues to lose 39 cm at birth of each child, leaving the fourth to cut the size of a toe and oh so vulnerable ... alas, pascal bruckner bad luck since i read last october the great novel by richard matheson, says there are more than fifty years, "the incredible shrinking man", and revised the adaptation to which he had himself carried to the movies. and the verdict is this: in the line of works covered by this theme of man faced with a change in proportion (swift, matheson and many others before him), this last novel does not really weight! c 'may be desired, you may say the comedy is meant to light the modern fable, symbolizes the current malaise of men who no longer know where their place, have their share of tasks and pouponnent , losing in their marriage and fatherhood masculinity. it was already knocking on the wrong door, that kind of consideration me as more sexist than anything else. moreover, pascal bruckner has probably inspired some episodes of matheson's novel to construct his plot, declining on a tone humorous that the first had been living in a tragic way his protagonist: sexual desire, the question on what basis the educational role of the father, the threat of the pet, use a doll house in size ... all these elements have been taken up and developed, making it "short novel" something tender and cruel, and entertaining, enamelled coats of arms of the female body. finally, its pretty cover that makes it a beautiful object almost prevent me to separate myself from him to go take his chance with other readers. in short, a reading that would be nice if you do not mind its precursors.
