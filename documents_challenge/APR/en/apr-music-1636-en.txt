doro occupies a special place in the hearts of audiences and media metal. more than the charms of the lady, passion, positive image, his perseverance over all these years and his loyalty to the music and her audience that make them and others would rather spend his mistakes . but we must have the honesty to acknowledge that "fear no evil" is not among the best achievements of the singer who gives us an album is more than average, giving all the cliches of the genre, where hymns constructed for stage obviously hiding compositions weaklings. doro has obviously not much to say about this disc rather painful to listen despite the best efforts. doro is a very convincing live, playing the passage of his charisma and energy, but his past record productions are not in his talent and his first album. too bad.
