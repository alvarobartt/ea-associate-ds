the mi 2 was to my liking as i missed out and did not respect the idea of drawers scenario is expected in these films. too much action sometimes ridiculous (the motorcycle chase, tom cruise recovering in a way that all laws of physics are reviewed, misuse of kung fu in slow, short) and too many liberties taken without great originality. but the mission impossible iii is more honest and more fun. a script must show sufficient and surprising action fluid. thanks.
