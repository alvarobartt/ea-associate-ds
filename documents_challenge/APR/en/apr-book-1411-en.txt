disappointed, too, but in the end for me. freemouss73 even that context, i was told "it's a shock is strong, unforgettable" so i hurried to finish my last book for me to finally dive and what could well contain this report. the beginning is well built, it is immediately placed in the bath: "it happened something horrible and i'll tell you about" the 4th of coverage does not lie, the phrase "i'm brodeck i have nothing to do "is looping in our heads. and then finally, after 150 pages i think this is long for what it could have happened. i feel that i am hanging around as it is hanging around viewers suddenly cuts commercials for finally seeing the show until the end of issue. i feel that reading the 4th coverage i read everything. like some movies, everything is good in the listing. finally, this is not a report but a newspaper. a newspaper war in which the horror of the camps, prisoners, mutilation is hard to read indeed, but in 400 pages, i am still waiting to know what could be worse in this town than brodeck lived on the front? finally nothing. a man has been cleared by a whole village because he was different, that's all. i say "it all" because it is very little compared to injury of a man described in the book, and it seemed that the main subject of the book is the content of the report, not life of one who writes.
