this film is a marvel, even if it offers some lengths towards the end. at the touch of a projectionist, a young child will discover the life, feelings, things that his father left on the russian front (see:) can ever teach him. the projectionist, played masterfully by philippe noiret, will serve as a substitute. the director has made a stunning fresco and very moving to italy after the war when we feel the political conflicts, the dramas of life, but keeping this part of commedia dell'arte, which is peculiar to this country, especially with the eloquence of the south. better yet, the theme of this movie is mostly to say that despite the amazement caused by everyone in the film, life itself is not cinema. proof is in the expectations of that child become teen who discovers love and bitter disappointments. unable to control this scenario, the young man will leave his village to pursue a successful career but emotionally ruined. at the death of the old projectionist, 30 years later, it finds the sight of the ultimate projection of rushes of kisses, all that he has failed. this film is simply magical. it touches the heart of all romantics, all those who dream of a magical destination, all those who believe in the redemptive value of beauty. the actors are wonderful. jacques perrin will be found many years later in a film whose theme looks very strange at cinema paradiso:. a note in this film that i liked to know what happened to the girl elena. missing this conclusion to the film. the film version of this dvd version is apparently truncated 12omn it when he is a director's cut of 170 minutes (probably) making a different purpose. bonuses for this version are particularly thin. i loved having such titles of films are screened at cinema paradiso, the sequences were derived kisses. in any case, a film to see.
