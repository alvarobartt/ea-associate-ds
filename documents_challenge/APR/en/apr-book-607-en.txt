i loved the series with william de lautaret. here, jean christophe duchon-doris emen us in austria, just before the return of napol√©aon bonaparte in the midst of negotiations that must decide the fate of france in particular and europe in general. through this investigation, we pass near or far the major figures of that period. they will also discover the cuisine of the time. in short, a good time reading that keeps you in suspense and makes you salivate.
