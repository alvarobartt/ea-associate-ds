this film is a common product with no other pretensions than to attract children. the scenario is non-existent and george lucas film with their feet. as special effects: i saw the movie for the first time on my tv and you see all the faults of inlays. jar-jar binks is unquestionably the best actor of the film and i hope he has an oscar. the film has nothing to do with the original trilogy, here it takes us for fools (or retarded by it) by telling us of immaculate conception (darth vader has no father!). the division is absent, giving the impression that each scene was filmed for the special effects, then stuck with the others. the music is the future of this disaster, where is the john williams superman? the players play without conviction (indeed could it be otherwise with lucas reached the turning to a blue screen?). finally, the grotesque and the ridiculous involuntary prevail in this commercial product. geroges lucas continues to pocket money on the backs of fans idiots who think they see is a masterpiece, then more fanaticism than anything else. george lucas should discontinue work with feet and back after his money.
