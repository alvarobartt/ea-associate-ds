i bought this book because of its notes and comments of praise. i'm not at all hooked, i still finished because there's really not a lot of pages. the writing is very simplistic and i think it's a book to be read strictly in transport (not much need to concentrate). it goes on very little and i found the story very close to american comedies and light commercial.
