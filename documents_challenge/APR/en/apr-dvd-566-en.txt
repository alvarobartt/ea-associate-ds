despite all the good that i expected, i did not like this movie. and yet, it could be good or very good. this is the kind of films that would have more if he had not submitted all these defects. first, what is it to put martial arts fighting in the middle of 18th century france? exotic originality? i do not ... there were better things to do. this is not the closed-mindedness, but this type of fighting is rather reserved for kung-fu. perhaps a detail, but i think it just kills the spirit of a film of capes and swords. i would add that the image synthesis of the monster is ridiculous (pixar can make fun of us!). nevertheless, the scenario is not bad, the atmosphere is very heavy and i can not reveal anything about this if you have not seen the film. thereupon, i agree, the film is quite successful. no acting skills to deplore, samuel le bihan, monica bellucci and vincent cassel are equal to themselves: very good. but i really did not like this hollywood dramatization. while you wait for surprises in form, the background is not so bad.
