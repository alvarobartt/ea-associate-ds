outside the booklet very pretty there is nothing very interesting in this second cd in the series, apart from the generic and too short but memorable 'mapquest' and 'charlie's temptation'. it is therefore little more than 5 minutes by adding still short subject on desmond. also note a few passages raw sweet little ears. but the rest is more background noise than anything else and frankly even a fan of the series is very soft and badly cut. not really you just have to get the original soundtrack cultissime season 1 lost otherwise masterly symphonic! especially since it is no longer available in any store! for the other seasons i can not comment but i am afraid there is little interest outside of a few pieces.
