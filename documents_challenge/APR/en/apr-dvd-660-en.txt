if you know there is absolutely nothing in ancient history, this film is for you. effective, and brutal, well staged, beautiful scenery reconstructions. we can do praise. if, unfortunately for you, you just know it's over. a film in u.s. history, in that it can be more derogatory. is ridley scott has opened at least a history book to find something other than images? it is not clear. perhaps, continuing this logic, we will be a western with cowboys armed with bazookas.
