my girl of 2 years and i have not enjoyed this book too, unlike nursery rhymes in creole. at least the creole included a little while there, we have no benchmark. we did not find the songs of interest (language learning) or even appreciation of music (arias uninteresting, hardly memorable), and is a music teacher who speaks! furthermore, the illustrations are quite dark the faces seem alarming. i do not understand all the praise read in other reviews!
