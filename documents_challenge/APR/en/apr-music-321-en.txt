true to themselves, the fatals picards on a background of rock give us food for thought. this is the first album since the departure of founding member and it proves that even if we lack the soul of fatal picard is still intact. the standard combat is inspired by the popular comic series of the past and larcenet mining and this worker north is well transcribed. bahamas to my hut is a satire of the american system and especially the vision we have of them to princes park is a special dedication to the fans (especially mtp) bang is a song to the "superbus" is the story of a chick deserves to be the hymn of enfoir√©s. all that to say that the album is as successful as at the music lyrics as well humor. they are always so assertive and so much more!
