a priori, it is the story of an american family type. a son, missing teacher in college who abuses a student but catching blouses capitalism with the ukrainian mafia, a girl who knows what she wants but not what it is, the eldest son, model social success with women and children on their own. add a mother a little stiff and a father whose rectitude and principles are struggling to offset the fact that he never managed to tell his children they loved them. it's funny, poignant, critical in any case to read.
