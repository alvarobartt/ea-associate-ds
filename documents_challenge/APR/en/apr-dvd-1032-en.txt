shyamalan we had taped with the 6th sense, since we expect the same stroke of genius. there were some films not too successful and others failures rather with phenomena we hit bottom. there is no rhythm, it is expected that things happen, that hsitire appears. as minute as the film deteriorates, boredom and you win - no there is no magic final. remove the name of the director and you do not even have a film series z. don'ts !
