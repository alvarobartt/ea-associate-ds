on alamo: beautiful american epic, a bit dated, where good feelings, a sense of honor, does not glorify a defeat. perhaps it would have been better to have the audio in english with french subtitles that can not be offered in the dvd. but do not spoil our fun, when you're not bilingual, it is masterly to hear john wayne we provide heroism disillusioned even french.
