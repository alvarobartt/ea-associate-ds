dream theater here, is by dream theater ... also, not to die completely c.. and facing the popularity enjoyed again and again the group of mike portnoy, i had decided to do the acquisition of "train of thought" as it exits. d ' outset i would like you to know that i am absolutely not against or even allergic to cavalcades guitarists, and other feats of all kinds they are; provided of course that serve or about music. but when it's too ... that too. of course! portnoy, the man with 20 toms, bass drums and 4 and 35 cymbals (i exaggerate?! if little) told me: "train of tought" would openly metal ... and believe me it is. no problems so substantially. only now! if in my big indulgence, i will ignore all this accumulation of "pumping (looting) in rule (metallica, megadeth, pantera and i forget) which is built on the album, which is he? ... an ultra-technical group, which, with the number of breaks / number of themes and ideas developed in one piece, would have to fill two entire albums at least. what harm, what hold the head! what claim against this particular course-auction and unpacking everything technical. after 5 / 6 or 7 albums you're still here guys?! opening and closing the album, "as i am" and "in the name of god ", failing to move me, still manage to hold my attention (still made it to)." vacant "is also a very nice instrumental interlude, which allows more real breathing. for the rest? ben's looks a little like this: nerhknsjnsfjs: khehfdijnjjnsszazfovl. i respect you mr. portnoy, do good, and also to greet me the musicians (?) that surrounds you, because despite my (many more) and acquired my years of practice on battery, i would never reach the science that is yours. whatever i assure you, because i always emphasize the spirit of the group show of force. everyone's tastes in short, but then left me to take full-mouth (and ears), i'm going to not listen on the field of musicians from porcupine tree (for example). the second star is for the booklet.
