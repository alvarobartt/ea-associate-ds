those who stayed with me on their hunger after incessant tapping of the sublime "antics" interpol find in the back room editors of excellent palliative, equally inspired by joy division, the songs are powerful, the melodies and voice singer's equally beautiful and captivating than interpol. stand the tubesque "munich" in fast tempo and very very catchy chorus and "all sparks" over 80s tinged with his guitar at the sisters of mercy. overall the songs are pretty fast (like banquet by bloc party): lights, fingers, someone says, blood (with a trend slightly more to the electronica rapture) others in a more calm and always evoke dark cure (open your arms), the blue nile (distance, sublime) or the atmosphere of joy division (camera). a hard dark but really fun to play as far from being monotonous and a new band full of talent to watch closely so.
