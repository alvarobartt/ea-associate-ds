contrary to what one could possibly think, "dark knight" title has no relation to the famous comic strip by frank miller and there is no question here of returning later on a judge set too early retirement. no, it's just more of a batman with a good joker makeup and pseudo-tortured characters who seek to make us say "oh dear, batman has become darker" ... the real novelty in this component, plus an attention to design aesthetics, is the opacity of the scenario that is collapsing under a barrage of fast action scenes or disorderly. pops, explosions, you got a full head for sure, but we do not always know why! from time to time, phew, a break for a few short sentences, dramatic, in lieu of dialogue, and it takes off. when the end credits sometimes it feels a bit numb and a week later all is forgotten. in short, an american stew that gives an air of greek tragedy to do well but still designed primarily for amateur clips and violent video games. look, do the test: ask people who loved to tell you the film and see.
