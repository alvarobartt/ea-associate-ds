declared spearhead the revival folk, devendra banahrt me there is a problem. what is devendra banhart, if it is to unearth talented musicians like vashti bunyan and bert jansch and bring up to date? having discovered during the release of "rejoicing in the hands", i been seduced by his voice and his music seemed to come from another era, a remote cabin in the forest. i inquired about the man and i came across references to tyrannosaurus rex. and from the first listen of tyrannosaurus rex, the smell of deception has emerged from my speakers: i felt myself being crooked and heard that 35 years ago, marc bolan was already the projected banhart on the front scene in recent years. the line between homage and plagiarism is often thin, but there the resemblance is such a new ear can not tell the difference between a tyrannosaurus rex album and "ni√±o rojo" and "rejoicing in the hands" from banhart. on " cripple crow ", banahrt began distancing with tyrannosaurus rex, but the problem is that quality does not follow, we are left with a medley of songs, finding inspiration in the musical resources of the hippie years, stroking the ears of nostalgic the time, but also those of a generation that wants to recreate this image. conclusion: when he made the tyrannosaurus rex, banhart is doing very well. when he made his own music, cest consensual and disappointing.
