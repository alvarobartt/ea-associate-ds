an album not essential if you're a fan of the first hour with ld.50. some zics who get their game well (fish out of the water, the hate in me, that dull boy had already been in by the same people ... what do u do that not a single bad!) for a set that looks too much like lost and found. they say that sometimes parallel projects tend to influence the group itself but it seems that the episode hellyeah there have done nothing except bring some semblance of solos! just have to wait for his train "game over" in 2009 to make a final notice!
