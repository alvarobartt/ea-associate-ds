very good package, all are successful, and then put in a dvd bonus is a very good idea. however, for the 3rd edition box set (3 trial is to find the right formula or it is the desperation to do the money?). however, loss of time for the fans, the dvd is a remix of the same tv images of claude, who are already on dvd 'hits and legends'. so if you're a fan who wants everything, and many c it is a big deal for arrow prod but a nice scam you. let's stay positive, so he must beware of claude in terms of its success.
