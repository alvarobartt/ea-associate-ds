nice voice, but it boils nice enough to make music! mr denzey rides the wave of commercial rnb and offers us frankly listenable songs (ehhh yes it moves well) but when you add words it is very very bad, not much to say is stupid, it's soup. it does not smell of searchable text and even the music is banal, it is calibrated radio ... is a history of commerce, i find it hard to understand this process! but hey go willy while not bad by being nice i can say that "beauty" and "the sky" can be heard ....
