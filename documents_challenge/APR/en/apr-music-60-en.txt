i loved the first symptoms, much like moon safari, just under 10000 hz legend. and after? ben after air became boring to die. i never managed to listen talkie walkie and pocket symphony in its entirety without biting the nose or without an irresistible urge to engage in other occupations. and this love 2 is unfortunately no exception to this observation. it hurts me to say as i respect dunckel and godin and the fresh breeze they have given to french pop to their beginnings, but from album to album, air has lost the inspiration and today the elevator music. with these 12 new titles, air is often repetition, often in the insipid, never in the stimulus. ca hack, trifouille it sounds but what for? ben is the whole problem: we do not know what is the music. some will hang, perhaps, not me, i take more pleasure in listening to air. one thing is certain, apart from being hardcore fan, this album is not worth the 15 that you ask your favorite record store, average price of a cd nine today. it will contrast the heyday of the bargain bins, within a very short time, i fear.
