jimmy tachery offers us a live album incroyable.moins known to the general public, jimmy is a true virtuoso who exel in his technique but also in search of her. mostly in his version of "red house" plays it. absolutely remarkable, and my eyes, the only version i know to be equal to that of hendrix ... just for this piece, the cd deserves to be bought.
