i say unambiguously, the relayer album is my favorite yes, far above the "close to the edge". when i heard for the first time "the gates of delirium," i do not believe my ears, it was crazy. this piece is an immortal monument of progressive rock, proving definitively that this is not necessarily a quiet type. a frenzy is the right word, perfectly in keeping with the title. it is entitled to a tangle of musical phrases evolving almost aimlessly and yet so consistent! i can not imagine how one can interpret perfectly if such a thing ... musicians should be in great shape that day. it was right up to delirium in the conclusion: "soon," a slow and romantic song that happens, however, logically, the calm after the storm. let the second side, which suffers a little shade from the first, but is nonetheless very interesting. "sound chaser" continues the momentum of "the gates of delirium" song delirious and difficult, a real hunting sounds. "to be over" is somewhat anecdotal, although very pleasant, ending the album on a more calm and stable. to conclude, i would say that i am always very difficult to appreciate any music either directly after listening to this album.
