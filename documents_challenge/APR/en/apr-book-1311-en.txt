i hoped this book many answers to my questions beginning with "how ..?". this book presaged a good coverage of the issue of valuation of industrial property. unfortunately, it only fly methods. disappointed mainly by chapters which were summarized under the method and an example that is: we decided to evaluate x â‚¬ ". how was this assessment made? we do not know from reading this book which does not disclose any track knowledge. i regard him as a catalog business, which is not my sense of being in its price class.
