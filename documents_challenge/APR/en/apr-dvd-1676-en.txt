no, i do not think minority report is such a good movie. while on the topic was interesting, but required a little more seriously at least in writing the script. the special effects were flawless, but took up too much space and once repelled the viewer, or at least your servant, the story itself, which was shared between "well done! "and" we believe it! . the jokes, gags, black humor were funny. full of adventures, dramatic moments of dramatic events. all this should have a good film, but curiously, alchemy does not. here we are dealing with a casual spielberg (what was his last really good movie?) and a tom cruise who falls in her little errors. of course, not magnolia, but still. in this regard, a friend remarked to me that this film does not leave room for the work of actors, rarely plan more than 5 seconds allowed to appreciate their work.
