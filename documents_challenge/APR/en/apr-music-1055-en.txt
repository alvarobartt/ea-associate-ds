david bowie is back within one year after the release of the album heathen. this album is less searching, more nervous than before, ready for the stage. a pearl is hidden in this disc and it will take until the last song: bring me the disco king with his jazzy tone is literally off the cd, with grace, emotion and vocal power. just the title is buying the album !!!!!! even though reality has not the depth of heathen is a very good album of bowie. visit a year to the next?
