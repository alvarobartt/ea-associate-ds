film hollow and terribly boring. the scenario is very plain, everything is called in advance and without any inventiveness (except the hilarious scene of sumotori - see below). the dialogues are a distressing flatness. vincent lindon, who always plays the same awkward character in crisis (remember it was 15 years ago) we used the series to infinity of "ah bon?", "good", "but", " i know not "blinking as usual and the movie is a long frieze of photographs plastered on each other without relief and without humor. strictly speaking, bonnaire might be more credible as an entrepreneur and an artist lindon ... merad and berl√©and are good but 2 nice supporting roles are powerless to catch a movie as zero. rated humor (yes, it's a comedy), the gobi desert dunes and less. oh yes, though: the famous scene of sumotori who can not return to the elevator so it is big ... really famous! even in carambar they are not thinking. in short, avoid by all means.
