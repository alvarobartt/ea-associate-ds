very disappointing book, which oscillates between stereotypes and caricatures. a young frigid girl (for whom sex is both repellent and necessary to any woman who is his "duty") and a young man any (without any special psychological proud doubt on the sexual act to follow) are found for their wedding night in a hotel in chesil. if we recognize that every moment of this type (both unique, special, intimate, etc..) is quite formidable to the mind, ian mac ewan treats, however, with astounding banality. and do not even speak of the end, which seems sloppy, shipped - but the brevity of the story does not say she already disinterest of the author's own topic? despite a few passages well thought out and well orchestrated, ian mac ewan is a flop - then reread atonement, which is absolutely excellent.
