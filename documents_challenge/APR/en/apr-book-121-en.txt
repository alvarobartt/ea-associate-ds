the book leaves us hungry. the rave reviews from my readers foreshadowed much better. the simple style makes the story too flat. we have a great sense of weariness of the hero vatanen but also of the author. the epic is a big chore for vatanen. nothing stands out other e history that a large fed. in the refined style i prefer much camus. the story reads quickly but provides little emotion. the style is clean and we know qu'n dealing with a good writer but fails to give us his idea.
