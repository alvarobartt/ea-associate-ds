i just finished viewing the film, and i do not know how to comment on what i saw: we pass a great time with very good players and the pace of the story very strong. the problem is that history is "distorted" from the book: the problems of decorum especially marked me and changed the plot to allow a happy ending faster ... despite the liberties taken by the surprising director, i liked!
