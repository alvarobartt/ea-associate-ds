many feelings exposed in this great movie. matilda is 19 years old in 1919 when she sensed that manech, the man with whom she got engaged 2 years ago, did not die in the trenches and saw somewhere. where? desperate? against all odds? multiple fatigue, toughness, love provides the strength necessary to survey black where destinies intersect. a good movie.
