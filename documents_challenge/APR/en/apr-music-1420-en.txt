i definitely want to leave a review because i love this album and g not want it going to waste! obviously all these tastes but short ... for the length of these tracks (11 minutes cups for eg.) fully justified by the intelligent structure to follow and we can never get bored by the fact that the pieces range from a heavenly trance and harder sounds and more industrial, the 3 geniuses electronic underworld invites us on a journey, an odyssey electronic ... a very pleasant album to listen eg. in his car (always in mind that travel tt ...) or falling asleep. a little flat, however: qques titles that i find breaks the atmosphere or at least that i've never managed to catch: skym, bruce lee and push downstairs. otherwise to me it's only jewelry on this album. in particular, jumbo kittens (an electronic abolument intoxicating samba), but above and push upstairs moaner. two electronic masterpieces. which stand out well in live ... if you have the opportunity to see this trio live, do not particularly miss it. their show is impressive. what would you have regrets, believe me
