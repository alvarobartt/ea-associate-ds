while the concerts are mogwai and are very similar and eventually boredom the scottish band has the happy idea of calling into question the studio and break the shackles in which some would have liked the lock, which is summed up by critics a very dull dichotomy between calm and storm. here, all the pieces are much more nuanced, and regularly flirt with the pop format, while revealing new aspects of the sound of mogwai, now richer, calmer, fuller, more beautiful. without doubt the best mogwai album to date, and a great source of hope for the future of the group.
