i like science fiction but without being an addict. having recently seen 1 episode of the original series of 1978, i found that over time really kich and overall not terrible. so when i spent a few episodes of the new galactica, i say bof! i expected nothing too terrible, not one of the fada "like star treck" well ac has nothing to do! this series is excellent! well this season 3 is quite mixed. the first episode in the best, then bah a little weakling (a little too much flash back of 8clos, etc..) considering the quality of scenario seasons 1 &amp; 2. cons by the end of last episode ... is 15 minutes away, you got a head full of slime and i look forward to seeing season 4 (good is the goal for the season to be said!) quality special effects for me are exactly what i want! very good but without falling into any digital suffered a bit last star wars by example. finally, 2 or 3 actors are impressive and for once the translation is vf. not everything is perfect in this series but the scenario is less concrete and no alien! not bad for science fiction! looks like a sort of "foundation" of asimov with the 2001 space odyssey finally made the comparative everyone wants it! would recommend highly.
