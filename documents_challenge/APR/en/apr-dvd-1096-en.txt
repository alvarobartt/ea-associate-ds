as and when the film, eastwood draws a landscape very overrated as well frankly reactionary films and here s'autoparodiant about how melodramatic i'm wicked and i repent. similarly melodrama in "million dollar" which is expected to say that eastwood first non (the little kid and the young woman) to finally say yes and yes. the message of tolerance is a wide boulevard with no risk taking since the tolerance (already problematic in itself since people come to define rules that exclude ...) is the new language of the existing timber. who can be against? all this is irrelevant and sewn with white thread so we expect a particular reversal. anyone with a true cross-reactionary can only smile at this sentimental message of false evil heart of gold who sacrifices himself to end. we smile at such simplicity. clint eastwood has never been a great director to the extent of a kubrick or fellini. it is neo-academic as well as turnips sudden impact (praise violence and justification of revenge), and other fireflow pale rider when you play the little judge ... a false myth.
