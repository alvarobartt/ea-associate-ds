criticize without being mean ... and yet, this book is very badly werber écrit.on not escape the clichés mass: the scientist in the long beards, those are found in the brewery down the newspaper, characters with names and characters to be pushed too crédibles.werber surely fun like crazy, for you ... werber is a good scientist, no doubt, he knows whereof he speaks, and the various theories about the origins of mankind (darwin, lamarck ,...) are very well exposed. the plot, though involved (but not interested in this topic??) is the limit of credibility, the dialogues are sometimes downright stupid ... second degree? not so sure ... a read out of curiosity. but i advise you more seriously ants or thanatonautes ...
