it must be said without false modesty, is the bronze 1 hair, 2 it is funny too. it installs and hop, it's gone for good words, improbable situations, the banana. for the 3 is different, from the first moment of consternation, as the day you want to eat exotic as you loved the thai, and mexican, you think i go. but was not! after a face, you look around, you're saying is not possible ... the whole world smiles with his mouth full, but dare not swallow. they say it's different, then there's a funny aftertaste. then finally someone dared: it is frankly disgusting. it takes one who says, to honor him. then it must go, too bad for the rest, because any effort makes the operation more and more unbearable. for this movie is like, after 5 minutes, it's so sad that it expects the first to suggest to stop the screening. our score is 14 minutes ... which is better?
