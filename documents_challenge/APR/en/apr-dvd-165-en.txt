zounds this is slow! the story behind the scenes and action at the tail end of fish as soon as they started. apart from paul bettany in albino villain and tom hanks in a rather restricted role that does not put particular value, the players play badly. as for history, we know by heart (who has not read the novel?) so that what was expected of all is to see small details or the fabulous historical sites which take place different phases of the action (as in harry potter for example, which recreates a world of fabulous ideas from the novel). alas, the screenplay written by akiva goldsman, already author of the lamentable batman &amp; robin, free-wheeling and insists heavily on what we already know (the templars, mary magdalene and jesus, da vinci and his paintings ...) while avoiding further that deserved to be. finally, the best part of the film lies in its soundtrack led by the great hans zimmer (who previously collaborated with howard on backdraft): mixing classical harmonies, backing vocals and synths, the composer comes to inject a bit of grandeur and power at a film which is singularly lacking.
