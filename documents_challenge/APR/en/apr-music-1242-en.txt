with "da real world," miss e had really set the bar very high, it was an excellent album. but there is a real disappointment: so addictive is full of annoying tracks of marshmallow formatted radio that they prefer listening rather zapper. there are many bad titles devoid of originality. luckily, there are excellent tracks: the electronic and rhythmic "get ur freak on" "lick shots" "one minute man" that save this album mediocre. to buy only if you're addicted to miss and r'n'b. otherwise go your way ...
