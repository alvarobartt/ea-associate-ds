"freely adapted" can be read from the beginning, and indeed, the early images, we said we will unfortunately be a little disappointed: - a lady of monsoreau fencer, a woman who teases the sword at 'time! (and i'm throwing a scene with banderas zorro + another strangely reminiscent hunchback with marie gillain) - our modern damsel is damned. in fact, she does not ride sidesaddle, but astride (trousers), something very rare at the same time to escape (!), one possible exception: diane de poitiers, who was a few decades ago when she hunting with the king. - esther nubiola is certainly very pretty, but gibberish (not enough available french actresses for the role?), so we often tends ear to understand what she has to say as diane mr. and is a bit disturbing - the male actors are a bit of soul, except f. quiring (the duke of anjou), which is quite credible. i was disappointed by the interpretation of thomas jouannet (looks a little too sarcastic all along) that i find really wonderful in "the silence of the sea." there, the current does not flow as well, but it would be much harder to embody werner in "the silence of the sea," which required a person acting skills a lot more intimate (light, silence ...). positives: the costumes are beautiful, the action scenes are well shot. conclusion: i prefer the 1st version classic series, available in box.
