it's amazing that this 1st april 2002, almost 7 years after the release of this fantastic album, i am the 1st to the column on amazon .... finally, as it is never too late to do here is my opinion: it is the best fnm album, yet it was hard to decide! but it includes all the know-how fnm and the genius of mike patton, weighed to the great beyond ... compos quiet, fast, rock crooner, slow, speed, unleashed, technical, inventive, in english, portuguese ... briefly, what about this masterpiece that fnm has rocked the world in 1995?? it is unique and good, direct and spontaneous, sought and end it all! "diggin 'the grave" is a firebrand unavoidable, insofar as is "ricochet" or are all the tracks on this album flagship of more crazy metal bands ... fnm! if you have not yet, it is a serious mistake if you have ordered, you are caught!
