it is already several weeks i tried to read this after a very ordinary first opus! but then i really can not do it! what's blabla dialogues endless, people no end and no flavor! the gods do not speak, they are worse than humans, insipid "fortunately i have other readings fantasy significantly more interesting! there eddings really disappointed me and i will be very difficult to come back! it is still their great sagas that i still reread with much pleasure!
