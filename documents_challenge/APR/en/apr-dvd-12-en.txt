ignore those lesser reviews and take my word for it as someone who has seen all of the best documentary series on world war 2 including the great 'the world at war' ken burns 'the war' and all of the bbc series to date . 'apocalypse' is a very good overview of world war 2 and provides an accurate representation of the larger and more prominent events of the conflagration. the series does not claim to be a conclusive and detailed representation and should not be viewed as such, but rather as a companion to the more detailed and of greater depth series such as the aforementioned "the world at war 'and ken burns' the war 'as well as the individual bbc series such as' nazi's: a warning from history ',' auschwitz - the nazis and 'the final solution', 'war of the century - when hitler fought stalin', 'the road to war' 'battle of the atlantic', 'd-day to berlin' and so on. 'apocalypse' can be considered a starter race after which viewers can choose to examine particular events in greater detail by looking at the series i mentioned above. many of the clips are ones i have not seen before and so add to my own library of world war 2 documentaries. i feel the series deserves 5 stars for effort. series such as these are now not shown during prime time television and so i applaud french television for showing this during peak time! bravo!
