i read this book 14 years since i had to reread it at least a dozen times. this book makes me cry, this girl can not get out of this m *** e what the drugs, it describes very well the world. this book gives no solution to the scourge of drugs at the end because the author died. his story is true, poignant as it was written while was still in the thick of it. i advise everyone to read this book!
