i still have trouble understanding all tappage done around this piece. i agree that it is written, the stories are beautiful and fun, and yet there's something for which one has the impression of wasting our time reading them. yet i have tried repeatedly to finish, but i'm not really hooked. other works are much better gavalda, they captivate us, but really, what is it that, i failed to find a great interest, especially since it hardly has time to s 'interest in history, it ends now. really disappointed but after all these are just my tastes, and fortunately, they are not universal.
