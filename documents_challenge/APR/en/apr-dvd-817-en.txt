at the risk of offending many moviegoers, i will confine my most complete subjectivity: who has seen "seven samurai" by kurosawa, film major in film history, "the magnificent seven" is a copied / pasted tasteless, odorless, without relief. so much so that i could not go until the end as the wonderful scenes from kurosawa was in my head and both of those sturges is 20 notches below. what fly has stung john sturges to accept this project and deeply embroiled in this matter? from my point of view, it is totally unbearable, almost as if gilbert montagne began to imitate us keith jarrett ... 2 stars for effort entertainment.
