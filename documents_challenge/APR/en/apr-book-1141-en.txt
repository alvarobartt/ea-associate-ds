i bought these books without bothering to read the 4th of couv. (i like surprises). when i understood what it was, i was afraid of being bored by reading something in the ac clark and asimov in such "hard science" completely outdated. well no! "journey" is great: suspense, engaging characters, scientic credibility; s. baxter has managed to amaze me with a story that may seem terribly mundane. by showing us the workings of nasa and politics, the author reaches his goal is to explain why at present there is no valid mars space program, and we ask a fundamental question: man he must at all costs go into space?
