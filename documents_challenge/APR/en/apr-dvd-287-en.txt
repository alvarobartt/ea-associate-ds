this series is simply brilliant! good, of course, both shots on u.s. teens are too seen and reviewed, but what is interesting in this series is the evolution of characters: haley, nathan, lucas, peyton brroke and evolve much from one season to another and we see them becoming teenagers in as! a series not to miss!
