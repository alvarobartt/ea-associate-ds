the first hour of the film is ultranaze, even comical. sadomaso of the albino opus dei is ridiculous, jean-pierre marielle, as he is about to die, finds the strength to his death scene and encode information ... it believes ... tom hanks is useless, his game is tasteless, and the role itself is no sort of guy who reads and that's all. audrey tautou, ben ... audrey tautou is a head slap to the french, who plays evil, which annoys. the kind of mysterious atmosphere is bof, and decoding the louvre as well, when tommy and audrey run in the corridors of table table to decipher what i know. a heavy aspects of the film is that there are codes and puzzles everywhere, even when it is not related to jesus. when ian mckellen arrives, it gets really cool (like a movie sunday night, eh, i'm not saying it's a good movie), mainly because there is finally a real game player to the screen. it's refreshing. even if the theories do not hold water (eg the fall of the templars is anything), it at least has the merit of being credible for a film and give it a stamp. unfortunately, the thing that plumbs all is that dan brown had said in his novel was great too true what he said, and so when we hear a few historical blunders, well we forgive not seen it's supposed to be authentic. the other thing that plumbs the film is the many twists on the characters that are part of ... but in fact it is just a cover because they are ... the film (and thus novel) is lost in these games identities unnecessary. the interest is there.
