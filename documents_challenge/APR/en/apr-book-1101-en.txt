... this book is quite disappointing! where we expected a sort of "brief history of time" added the latest discoveries in theoretical physics with more patterns to better understand. well no ... the book as a whole really lacks consistency, the text is quite difficult for the uninitiated and poor for others. and the patterns are indeed very pretty but not very sensible! too bad.
