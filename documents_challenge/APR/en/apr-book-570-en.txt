one finishes this book in a fluffy state, sad and optimistic at the time. we let himself be carried by something soft, fluid, of course. the magic of writing. the feeling that gives this book is amazing. i read it straight through, however, by buying a crocodile tears at mid term. i have done: he took me to the end. fantastique.
