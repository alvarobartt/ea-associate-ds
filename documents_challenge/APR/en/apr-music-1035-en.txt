in short as 22 tracks: huge. the 2nd solo album from frank black is simply henormous. everything passes, punk-rock convulsive ( "pong") to reggae jingle ( "fiddle riddle" - well, say, not what is most successful in the album) through d 'unstoppable pop gems of science fiction (as "big red", inspired by the mars trilogy by kim stanley robinson). unable to resist this disc bulimic and multifaceted, considered by some disgruntled people as the last true testament to the creative genius of bubbling mr thompson.
