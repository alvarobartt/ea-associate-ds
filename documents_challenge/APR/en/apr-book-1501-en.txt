doudou is a book in the words of clarabel. read on vacation, reading to do good, to read for wanting to live more. a modern writing. a story i like. a thunderbolt to that philibert to the toilet is toilet facilities. in short, you will understand, a great blow to the heart. the film unfortunately not quite like the book but pretty distribution can spend a pleasant moment.
