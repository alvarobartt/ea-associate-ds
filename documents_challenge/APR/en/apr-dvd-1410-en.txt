i keep it here to make a comparison between the film and the novel on which it is drawn, because i do not know and did not play. i would add that what i saw did not give me want to dive. this is the movie that seems ridiculously long, stupid, immoral and unhealthy. need we say more? i will not dwell on the end, stupid and worthy of a very bad "trip new age. ultimately, a very bad movie that leaves a scent memory as "disgusting", like the smell of rotting fish market in paris depicts the beginning. to be avoided because it is a waste of time and money!
