there are those thick books that ends too quickly so it is taken, and some much shorter but we seem forever to finish. 'because i love you' is in the second category. completely implausible we come not to return for a second in the history of the characters too happy ending too, everyone loves, no one wants anyone ... but i put a second star for the story of evie, the only almost touching.
