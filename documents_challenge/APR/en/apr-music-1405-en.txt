unconditional fan of these debuts daho since i am very very disappointed with his new album. apart from 2 songs lighthouses back to you, if it appears that daho wanted release an album quickly without trying to reach the level of the previous album. i try to listen the album in vain, i am not at all inspired. yet his writing is excellent but is it a question of a change team of musicians that can daho his pa find the right chords? this is the first album that i find disappointing ... it's a shame ... i do not really understand the popularity of this album some pr ... matter of taste?
