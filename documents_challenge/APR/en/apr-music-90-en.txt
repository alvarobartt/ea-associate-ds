the man who killed a second time brel still rife and dare we say "it's like that." well no, it's not like that. his little arrangements with his record company like "i'm going through a hard year, must live!" well we're not willing to pay him his vacation in the pentagon. it can raise horses, cultivating poppy (what is prohibited? ah yes ...) but mostly he takes over the plane to break our ears or the paris-rio then! album avoided because c 'is really a soup ... please vote "no need to review a disc useless"
