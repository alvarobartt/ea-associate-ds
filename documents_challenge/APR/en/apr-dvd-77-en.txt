as stated earlier another user, there are only 14 episodes in season 4, after the writers strike and we were punting (very stupid we are!) the cabinet to 40 euros! this season is much better than the second and third season in terms of revelations, especially from the problem of rhythm, it becomes interesting only from the seventh episode! fortunately, the last three episodes are excellent and make us want to see season 5. but, in my opinion, this fifth season (the last?) leave a lot of unanswered questions! it is unfortunate that after a superb first season, lost will be bogged down in too many episodes of unnecessary and boring (the entire second season and a big part of the third). this season is no exception to the rule with a very early spineless and annoying characters who play too much mystery i know lots of things but i can tell you nothing !"... far from convinced by the scenario that plays travel through time, however, i expect the fifth act impatiently ...
