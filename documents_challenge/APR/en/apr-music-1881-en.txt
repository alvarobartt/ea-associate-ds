as i expected, all the so-called fans who boycotted the period owen ruraient on this album and would cry at the same genius without having listened. yet it is clear how the return of the prodigal son is a huge hoax. nothing on this album, does not justify the return of rob halford at the microphone. the pieces are flat, already heard billions and billions of times before and, especially, we have the unpleasant feeling that the musicians are fully rested on the back of the most legendary singer of the group. after two albums where he had everything to prove and that he had surpassed (excellent jugulator and demolition), the group chose the easy road and offers a great loss of credibility among true music lovers. perhaps the next?
