very nice description of the pleasures of camping. a family atmosphere prevails in this site where regulars gather each year ... so, when a "bourgeois" happens by chance in this place, just thickens and mixes everything: joy and pain, betrayal and friendship, but with a lot of humor in shading film ... well tied up, to do without hesitation.
