i have that book for several years already and i always keep with me in my travels. it is easy to read and super interesting. what i like most is that whenever i have no moral and especially when i underestimate i take the book, i open to any page and read, all positive in the book helps me up the hill (not that the book already but of course it helps enormously to relativize). by cons i've never done the exercises ... i recommend it to everyone around me and i never had any negative comments.
