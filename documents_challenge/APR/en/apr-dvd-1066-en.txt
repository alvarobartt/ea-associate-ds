i'm a fan of "body snatchers". the first. that of 1956. a true sf classic of the genre. and then there was the version of kaufmann in 1978. sutherland, nimoy, goldblum. a strong cast for a more modern version, and my faith, not far from the first. more demonstrative, but excellent. then comes the version of abel ferrara, more nervous, but not necessarily more interesting. and "invasion". and there, bof, bof. nothing more. some scenes rehash of the 2nd version and a little further, and nicole kidmann not really inspired. so, a small invasion, with the 7th art could happen, and you too!
