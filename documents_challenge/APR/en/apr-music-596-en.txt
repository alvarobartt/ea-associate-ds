frankly the pouch gives immediately wanted to buy the cd, miranda is very nice and attentive we discover a beautiful and powerful voice, very typical country. miranda is rather comfortable in the traditional pieces, ie 2 or 3 tracks, however it addresses the most rock tracks, it sounds wrong and is limited to the relatively poor. in short, i have not heard the first album but this one is a reserve for fans.
