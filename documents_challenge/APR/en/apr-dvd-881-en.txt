much obliged to put a star for a film nullissime who do not deserve. it is the story of a young man of 17 who reveres his mother but one day the latter decides to show his true face. basically, "you've taken all these years for a saint, i'll show you that i am an arrant s ---- e"! sonny is a little disappointed at first but the morality of this film is that you quickly get used to a life of debauchery. then mother and son, together, we are drawn into their adventures all the more perverse than the other. nothing is spared us for sexual deviancy (we almost went to pedophilia at a time) and the highlight is of course an incestuous relationship that we feel come from the beginning. what suspense my ancestors! add to that pompous and pretentious dialogue that rings false even in the mouths of isabelle huppert (straw!) and staged pitiful that we gave the impression of watching a bad sitcom, version sado-masochistic. bravo monsieur christophe honore to add more of depravity in a society that does not yet need. in my case your dvd is directly in the trash!
