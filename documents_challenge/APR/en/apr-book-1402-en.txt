a nice cover and back cover attractive pushed me to buy this book ... i regret that choice a few hours later. indeed anupam kher us a piece of history disappointing. research on the painting and the techniques described are not sufficient to give interest to the book, the artist's life is devoid of rebound. we can not cling to the same person whose misfortunes can not soften us. of course it is written (as always) but i expected better from the author of the alley of the king or the child of light!
