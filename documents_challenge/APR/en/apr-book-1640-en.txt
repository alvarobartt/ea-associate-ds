i bought this book knowing the power of nicola sirkis to handle words and tell the various misfortunes of our society (through its songs) and i was not disappointed. i found the black world and enigmatic composer and singer of the famous rock band indochine. the book is both murky and funny, cruel and moving. many themes are explored and very openly, unashamedly, he speaks of suicide, of incest, the fear of death, but it is twisted at times (i think particularly in china or dayle peep show). this is an excellent book not to read before bed and not put between all hands either, as it is sometimes shocking. an achievement for a first book, and hoping that the following will be in the same vein.
