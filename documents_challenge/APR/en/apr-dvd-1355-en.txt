the first movie was really great, but once we saw the second one must admit that the former is poor. all to say that the cradle of life is much more interresting and exciting than the first. the waterfalls are spectacular and the means of transport rather surprising and funny. i urge anyone who has not yet seen the watch and you will appreciate for sure. this is a really good movie
