justified was much dancing and an album full of singles who have made the rounds of radio stations and nightclubs, this new album is disappointing and badly put together over time. the sound is certainly modern, well worked, but too much of the 13 songs on this cd are alike, all at the same pace, the same phrasing. the side "known tweak our machines lies a big gap to the 2nd or 3rd listen. we will retain 5 songs absolutely geniales (27 minutes) about 71 minutes of music that give a little headache. the rest looks like a mixture between the old missed funk and michael jackson 80 years ... a mix between old and fusion of r &amp; b. in the great songs: "future sex" is a good song with a bass much like "another one bite the dust" queen, "my love" is a pearl between techno and r &amp; b (great song and clever mixture and may be a harbinger of a new musical movement ...), "what goes around" is a good michael jackson with a sample arabist damn well, "chop me up" is a good r &amp; b that moves well that sounds kick ass in a rise in the 3rd minute and then "summer love" is a single which is quite cardboard radio. then we have missed the song: "sexyback" is frankly unbearable (what an idea to leave ca in single), "sexy ladies" and "lovestoned" is very bad funk that has 20 years behind, "damn girl" is messy, "until the end of the world," "losing my way" and "all over again "michael jackson is the very syrupy (with a gospel not even highlighted on" losing my way ") and they give with hauls feel it necessary to fill the cd ... note also that some songs are bonded to other shaped interlude and if you want to listen "i think she knows" is nice, you have 5 minutes of stuff "lovestoned" before ...
