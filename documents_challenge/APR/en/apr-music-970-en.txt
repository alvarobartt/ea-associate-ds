parts &amp; labor is an indie rock band rather classic dan friel if there was not full of sounds incongruous and strident. so when he goes to an album all alone on its side with its sounds that make furious parts &amp; labor wildly original, it's enough jumping frantically as a child before the christmas tree. and the result is frisky and joyfully frenetic. synth abusing children with diverse and varied effects as to make them spit out sounds that resemble the sound of a fax or an old 56k modem, he managed to compose songs really catchy at the limit of infantilism but swimming in a bath with essential oils of saturation. it is as if the cartoon channel was parasitized by the snow, a sight and strident faces of aphex twin.
