it'sa shame. the film part well with a scenario pretty good (even if it is far from pk dick), and what we see is rather nice. in short, very entertaining. the problems begin after: the scenario was so clever helps destroy the suspense (if you see the movie you will understand), and especially the players play like oysters. ben affleck is as usual as expressive a buche, and i do not know what came to uma thurman in there. they are supposed to be lovers, but they seem too close to each other that my sofa and my refrigerator. at most they have vaguely good friends ... the worst is that i've seen in vo (i'm bilingual), dubbing there is nothing. the realization is fairly soft, which does not help.
