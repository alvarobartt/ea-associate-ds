if you want a scientific book on the subject, this is not the book you need, it is actually made of short chapters dealing with what surrounds the mainstream that makes life so sweet: excerpts from jules verne, meeting with scientists and sailors, stories of sailors and explorers who helped develop the oceanographic effects of current on the norwegian life .... in fact it is a ballad in which the author grapille news and we send them to as. i did not like this form, nor substance in truth, but it is a matter of taste, which displeased me most is the lack of maps to explain, demonstrate, demonstrate. for sure this is not a scientific book, but if you want to enjoy the poetry of the sea and the imagination it causes in humans, but read jules verne and hugo.
