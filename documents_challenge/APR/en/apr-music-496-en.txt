ouch, ouch, ouch! and another of my favorite bands disappoints me sorely. however, the first title, "za", was promising. it includes the thundering supergrass and without complex that has always loved. but from there, pfiou! what has happened to the teenage rage of the first two albums, this desire to do battle with the largest groups of rock history and all eat? one wonders. on this record, we seem to hear a group of granddads dwell forever their memories of youth. the songs are obviously made to chain, with technical mastery, but without the slightest ounce of inspiration. as for interpretation, it is true that the group can do with big juicy guitars and keyboards sixties played by competent people, but without passion. the drive takes place, not bad indeed, but at no time did he take off. form without substance? that's exactly right. this album is all pretty full, well done, but when you rub a little polish, there's nothing underneath. extremely frustrating.
