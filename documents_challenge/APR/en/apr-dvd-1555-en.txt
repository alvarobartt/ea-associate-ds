good people know that the series san ku kai draws most of its special effects film, "escapees from space". here it is, therefore, the film fiddled to make it appear that only exists in the series. but the film existed before the series, which merely reiterated the action scenes to spice up a particularly seedy soap (be aware that the episodes were filmed in 1 day, a feat). in short, there is misrepresentation of the product.
