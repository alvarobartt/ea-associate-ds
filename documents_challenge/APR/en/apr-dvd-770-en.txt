for years i expect the release of this film on dvd. this is by far my favorite movie. meg ryan has not changed and chistal billy is still funny. the dialogues are sharp and humorous. the sc√©narion is not unlikely. in short all the ingredients to switch excelentes evenings. to watch again and again!
