a film junkie without turning professional at the boucherie.jean-hugues anglade plays its role in psychopathe.le group burglar is not standing still and whine like kids .. produced by quentin tarantino i expected much better scenario facie effect of unnecessary scene and many inconsistencies (out of a solution?!). but seeing eric stoltz from the very first minute film is expected to head-work and julie delpy is really not bad ... also a short film that has not missed the size of a tarantino film or even a tony scott with his film true romance.dommage for paris ...
