... this album is a gem, an album released discreetly, in all modesty, which is not without delight all those who are fallen under its spell: this album it is a bit to each of its worshipers. but if we must think about the artist, he has really deserved more recognition, because unfortunately, a matter of promotion may be, he could not find its fans, well, not all ... but now may be, he found you! an album acat√©gorique: electro, dub, hip hop, trip hop, trad, folk, bass drum ... yeah pretty much anything that a true personal creation, a true artist creating one days yes blue print has its place, the great art under glass with enclosures around in a museum on the 21st century.
