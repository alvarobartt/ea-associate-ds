more than 5 years after the last album (very) regretted distillers, brody and tony return with a new group. to supplement, are added johannes and irons, respectively ex-queens of the stone age and former red hot chili peppers. well, all be direct: if you do swear by the old school punk to "sing sing death house and that its format pop horrifies you, you can go your own way. you'll be disappointed and i have also been greatly in the early plays. by cons, if you let a chance spinnerette, you will discover that this is a superb first try.'s side, it has clearly evolved and influenced the sound of "era vulgaris" of qotsa obvious ( "sex bomb" good "spectral suspension" or "rebellious palpitations"). it is also less aggressive than in the first part of the career of distillers. i will tell the dirty word: more radio. but the album starts strong with the single "ghetto love" is the most energetic song of the album and continues with the excellent "all babes are wolves". brody dalle is clearly trying to vary his vocals on this disc which is a most laudable. the best tracks for me are "cupid" would make a wonderful film credits, the soaring "distorting a code", "driving song" and "the walking dead" my two favorite tracks. the guitars are softer but the songs are mostly catchy. "impaler" is a title rather surprising. to conclude, this is an album worth listening to even if it has some flaws. the writing was probably better on "coral fang". and the last shot of mouth: when you hear their great sound in concert (including an extra guitarist on stage) and that cd is still on his hunger can only get worked against the overall trend fmis sound. "spinnerette" could have been much better and may even disappoint fans of the first hour of brody. rip the distillers.
