my love for the heroic fantasy i owe this film a little kitschy but oh so good! one thing that is changed domage voices in dvd ca change slightly the nature of history. sarah indeed, instead being a teenager who loves a world populated by fairy and troll in the old version, is found to be a teen in crisis in the dvd version! shame! but see absolutely is a cult movie!
