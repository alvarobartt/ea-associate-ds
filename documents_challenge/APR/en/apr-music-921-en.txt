tobruk is an english band that makes a melodic hard american. from the very beginning of their career they have had success in the u.s. bases located in england. this album has the same producer and bon jovi on his first album. that says it all. this first disc tobruk is very successful: very good components, good sound ... so many hits like "wild on the run" or "breakdown" will delight you. through the rapid "going down for the third time." never mawkish, this disc is worth the trip failed. ********************** melodic hard / fm big bill of ***************
