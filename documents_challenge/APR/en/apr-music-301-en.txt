with this second album, who had been conquered by debut, bjork know that party will now have their favorite artist. with a whole, a structure similar to the first album, begins with a song very loud and rhythmic. then follows a random, ballads, songs and completely unexpected piece headlight ... bjork built this second album as a classical symphony. start with a piece allegro and finish a piece in the form of the adagio ... and this is the case for virtually all of these albums. post also continued to lay the groundwork for what the artist tries to show us, to make ourselves heard and make us feel the world from which it came. the sounds are all recognizable and have a life of its own. probably it is the only artist to use his electronic machines to give life to the impossible. surrounded by musicians and producers in his cup, she educates her way to what could yet be just boiled and musical zeal of his hack. what emerges is that quintessence and every new miracle plays. this creature half-woman half-elf gives us the hair and makes us cry with happiness.
