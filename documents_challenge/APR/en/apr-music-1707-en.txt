it is here that a handful of songs, mostly short and interpreted using a limited number of instruments (guitars, bass, percussion). in fact, 13 songs among the most beautiful ever written, interpreted in a majestic voice, scarcely patinated and produced a sound so intimate that it is as if one is found in an old victorian style house very shady california, venice or north hollywood, for example, the first floor in a room, and the orchestra will play for us, and sam we murmuring in his ear sweet words. the high class pure. a drive of thirty minutes that lasts for hours because it is impossible not to listen loop. attention to those who have a cd player with several plateaus, the transition has another disc may create an emotional void difficult to fill later. this disc does not open water in two, does not multiply the loaves and does not change water into wine. but it can also do much more ... if you do not believe me, simply try.
