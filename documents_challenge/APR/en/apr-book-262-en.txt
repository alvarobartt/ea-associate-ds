in this book of 900 pages, we advance slowly after qq time there as necessary. he says, engraved, a turbulent period in our history :1940-1943. the author develops a real intellectual finesse and beautiful hand writing. even if you are frustrated by the time (the author recounts the first meeting of the national council of resistance, rue dufour in paris for what he has seen ..... that is waiting on the sidewalk opposite!) is a strange book in its atmosphere but exciting. in all modesty, i would recommend.
