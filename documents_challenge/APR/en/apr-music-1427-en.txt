the second album gun club, a group of legendary psychobilly scene in los angeles in company x, the cramps and some others i have bought time for his wallet, as striking and as haunting and original music contained inside. a music mixing rock, punk, blues and folk, mad, violent, bare, and jeffrey lee pierce, lived, haggard, singing (not always fair but we do not care), whispers and screams as an animal at bay in the desert of death ... many more savage than the first album, "fire of love" released the year before. contrary to the latter that i discovered in the era of the compact disc, i used to listen to especially the first side of "miami", particularly impressive, a perfect sequence of wild and insane tracks (in the middle with a cover of creedence clearwater revival, which integrates seamlessly with all ). alas, the result would be much less exciting that these two outstanding albums, and jlp who so loved blondie singer and he began to want to be like him physically (hair dyed blond, makeup, etc.) would disappear an excess of drugs and alcohol in the middle 90s, but gun club would affect many groups among which the u.s. sixteen horsepower and a french group that did more than inspire it and who built his style copying it outright; jeffrey lee pierce also spoke with bitterness about it. too bad the cd edition available now does more greenish the picture so strange ... this color, animal records label had good recovery in an edition that was released just a few years ago, it is that i am fortunate to possess. animal, as this album dazzling and wild.
