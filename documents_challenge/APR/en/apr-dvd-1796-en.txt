this film confirms the trend announced by "djomeh", ie it will take getting used to iranian non-contemplative films! this film deals with the same subject, however, that "the circle", ie the fate of women in iran. but this time the subject is approached with a healthy dose of humor. and while "the circle" we proclaimed for the umpteenth time a fatalistic on the status of women, "the day i became a woman" merely illustrate three different stories, the absurdity of certain traditions. then even if the iranian cinema scares you, do a little effort, go see this movie. you will see that iranian cinema is now able to handle the humor, and this with the same success that the british film!
