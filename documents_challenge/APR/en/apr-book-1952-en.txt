they told me 'you see, it's great, there's no better! " they were wrong. jai tried to read this book. i am currently in my twelfth test of a book that has aged badly, which is written in a pompous style, complicated and clumsy a story where the breath of the adventure has not yet appeared in five hundred pages . you've loved so much the better, but do not particularly believe that this applies to everyone. to me the lord of the rings remains synonymous with the pinnacle of boredom. at least the film itself is enjoyable to watch! i am ready to argue what is basically a matter of taste!
