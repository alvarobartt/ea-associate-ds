by not trusting in the pocket, i must confess that i have thought for a moment that avril lavigne had joined the fan club of britney spears. fortunately, the musical content is quite another. the pop / punk rock trendy californian teen to avril lavigne is still as effective "i can do better," "runaway," "everything back but you," " i do not have to try ". just add the beautiful ballad" innocence "which is reminiscent of telentueuse norwegian lene marlin. being a fan of rock a little more thought usual, i must say that this album i actually spent pleasant moments. full of freshness and joy of living, "the best damned thing" is not a perfect album but ideal to begin the wonderful summer ahead of us;) perhaps more commercial and less personal than the 2 previous albums ... good but what matters most is the pleasure of listening to this side, not to worry. the star, pink, blond hair, an angelic voice ... it is far from 'look punk / skater who respects but what energy! good listening to all!
