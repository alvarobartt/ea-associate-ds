when the texture of worship songs by king crimson is captured on the spot by the size of jazz so it gives nuggets that successfully tanscender the original tracks. the drummer here is none other than the first batter of king crimson, ian mc donald, a large goodman the golden arm. this album is magic. a second volume must be created next year. and ultimate guarantee you will find the back of the jacket comment of sir fripp which more than validates the project. say it clearly, he loved it! and that opinion connoisseurs crimsoniens is rare!
