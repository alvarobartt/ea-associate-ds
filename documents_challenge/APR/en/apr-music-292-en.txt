i do not come here to break the sugar on this artist. all tastes are in nature and it happens that i am not really prepared for this genre. however, i understand hilary duff had changed its registry to be located on land where no one expected it ... this is not my opinion since on the contrary, with rare exceptions, duff does nothing new. his fans probably appreciate this album, others may feel cheated ...
