as l have said my brethren an album of beautiful acoustic test all the other albums are good but this one has just the minimum of arrangement which must be compared to the next. i also advise roman candle because for me the 3 songs that are novel candle, condor avenue and last call deserve their places in the best songs and new moon even if the purists will say that they already knew some titles because he too is simple in these arrangements since we found that the songwriter in his simple dress c is to say with his voice and his guitar and we became aware of his talent. i'm a fan of rocky votolato j but admits that elliott smith also ca vaut le detour. the 2 are strong but elliott played in a record more refined and suptile requires several listenings to fully realize that the genie that was lost. rest in peace elliott because your tracks are cntinuer and go to the dream world.
