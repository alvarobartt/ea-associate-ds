by far the most disappointing of the three ... special effects are, of course, but the appointment .... what are we doing here?? between a cyclops who die in 2 min 30, a professor xavier sprayed and so on ... it will confuse the script is poorly done and it's great no matter what! the end could be totally different and therefore better (instead of killing jean gray ...) i frankly find bad and yet they could have done something great notament with the appearance of the angel and the other characters like the girl who goes through walls, but instead of that they all sloppy! very disappointed.
