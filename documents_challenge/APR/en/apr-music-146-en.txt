if i have to advise a beatles album (although all are "brilliant" as our british friends say) it is the latter. indeed, help! can listen loop. there is not one song that is a pure gem. however, for better appreciate the cd, i advise fans to try to obtain the film which is itself also a pure masterpiece!
