for me, cest because of this season that galactica will eventually be the leader doeuvre quil could have been. attention bsg remains for me the best tv series any kind but confused at this season the first cracks appear scriptwriting. the evolution of the script is done depends on the frame and i saw that as a work bsg global cest a big disappointment. especially since this season started in an extraordinary way, the first episodes are incredible intensity dune without artificial dramatization as cest too often case in movies today. and more: actors fully inhabited by their characters, the first episodes of heavy thematic intensity and incredible dunes, as dhabitudes depth of the series, unfinished business l√©pisode that jai particularly liked yet denude daction but totally beautiful . the least: the first major inconsistency in the storyline (far from that lon may find in an other series, but the greater the value, the greater is considered severe), some stand alone trying clumsily incursions into thematic bsg tackles already. bsg remains to conclude a single series, but bsg this season is looking for several episodes and resumes running against dune consistency which explains the 4 stars.
