a quasi-camera performed brilliantly and served by two excellent actors: colin farrell and kiefer sutherland absolutely amazing things not seen enough film from the 2000s! one could feel jaded at the sight of that phone booth or the plot unfolds ... but no! the staging is such that we come not to win in one minute! you never know how the story evolves from one moment to another. small anectodes: at the end of the projection is only if i stay one nail at your fingertips! a must see!
