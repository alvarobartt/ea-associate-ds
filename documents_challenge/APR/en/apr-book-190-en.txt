warning! this is a personal opinion but i think the future reader of this work should know my opinion: i have not hooked this book distils, by his style one idea per chapter, i have not returned either in the history of mass suicides, human happiness in drugs, a robot on-man ... this book is as "corrosive" as the best of worlds if there anticipation in the book of huxley, it seems to me that we met intelligent robots in our streets as imagined tevis! maybe i will read this book in 30 years and i will modify my comment! meanwhile, there are many other sf books that await you ...
