i think this latest album from mark knopfler fairly bland, especially after the sublime "all the roadrunning" with emmylou harris. the album is very quiet (but is it a surprise?) and i especially appreciated "punish the monkey" and to a lesser extent "madame geneva". the rest has not scored more than that. after a few weeks i dropped this album (except punish the monkey). maybe i did not listen enough but good verdict today (pending potential other plays) is that the album is not very good and i'm pretty disappointed. it should already see what gives these titles live if indeed he plays them. in any case, mr. knopfler is much better.
