kamelot is currently climbing mount everest. each album is better than the last. this is often the case among the very first album of a group and include it here but did not deny last 8 albums and this is much rarer, especially when the bar is already set very high for 3 albums. it is therefore my humble opinion, but that seems shared by other enthusiasts, one of the very best bands in the symphonic metal vein. moreover, it does not yield to sirens that have other groups, also full of qualities, take a few detours to please the greatest number. the principle is not in any reprehensible after all, an artist it is always important to see his work appreciated the better. but it is unfortunate that this happens at the expense of what these artists really feel. no danger with kamelot me it seems, they have remained true to themselves and, icing on the cake, without repeating himself. let us still continue to produce discs of this quality is all the harm we might want.
