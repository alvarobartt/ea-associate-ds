both the devil wears prada is a delight, not people or people is pretty good, but it is very disappointing ..... it bored stiff, he is more like a harlequin but in no case found the piquancy of his other books. ... everything is predictable so to book a train journey or on a beach when you really read all that was interesting to read. shame, shame
