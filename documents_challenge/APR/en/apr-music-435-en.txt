this album is great. titles spitting games, run and chocolate are great. their music is a blend of melodies and sounds sharp. the inspiration and the aggressiveness of the singer / gitare gary (he has composed many songs and sang on almost all tracks), make this album a great album. snow patrol stands out from other groups. so for those who like pop / rock alternative please have you over without restraint, you will not be disappointed!
