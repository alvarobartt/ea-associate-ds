the period instruments, there is hardly, if we except the ropes course (stradivarius and company ...), the others are copies of old that are not just of time but instead produced by contemporary wise and respectful but unfortunately not at the time of stradivarius. therefore just talk and not say anything on this subject. in short, the music is pretty much what it is sandstone of fantasy and seriousness of the interpreter. what i regret, however, is the variety of tuning forks (knowing that at the time of bach, there was no tune and the absolute height did not exist and that therefore the height of the "diapason" remained chaotic, so much so that the same work, played at a different location could change the tone of your superior tone lower, eg, the magnificat was sometimes played in d, sometimes in e flat major) and tones lowered to half-tone as these discs are unusable in music schools because the traditional system "based" on the diapson to 442.
