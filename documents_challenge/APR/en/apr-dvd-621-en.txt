complicated as c: that's what i take from this film. to further deceive the viewer, the screenwriter of the film wrote a story completely twisted which everyone betrays everyone ... almost! certainly, the complexity of history is characteristic of this type of film, mounted on a anarque great. nevertheless a good movie scam is a film that confuses the viewer's mind while remaining consistent. unfortunately, this is the first issue of cash: the scenario is not consistent. take the test: after the movie finished, try to rewrite history with all the elements. you will not get there everything is not explained, and many questions remain unresolved. this means that the script was shoddy. a as attractive: dream cast (for a french film), jean dujardin always so friendly ... it attracts! this is why i watched this movie. s as superficial: this movie is totally bling-bling. it seems it went out of fashion ... and so much better in these times of economic crisis! i think i saw once actors boirent anything but champagne. the lofts are huge, luxury cars, lavish hotels ... one has the impression that the producer wanted to offset the poverty scenario in luxury means. unfortunately for him, this is not the recipe for a good film. and it is a nothing as sickening ... h ... i have not found! neither homer nor horrible, this movie is between the two: it is average. the two stars are deserved, but that's all he deserves.
