i bought in 1992 on 12 vhs tapes of the miracle and the world have watched many times. when i saw that tf1 out these stories on dvd, i immediately purchased. big disappointment: the quality is poor, it is not higher than it was on vhs. also missing episodes from the vhs series. little extra: review of a science writer for each episode quite well.
