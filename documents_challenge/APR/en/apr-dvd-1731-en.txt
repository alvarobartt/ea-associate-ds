if, in response to dark perverse inclinations, you decide to buy this dvd know that: 1 the story is grotesque (miyamoto musashi is the god of war and waiting in a remote temple in the mountains of being beaten single combat) 2 / actors play very badly, it does not help that one french dubbing for less atrocious 3 / it takes just over an hour and it is only talking in there until final duel which is rather less successful than thousands of the same type seen in "crouching tiger, hidden dragon", "hero" and so on. rent with friends, beer, pizza and a warm or two turnips in the same field.
