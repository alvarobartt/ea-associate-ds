so that's the new school new yorker? ben is frankly terrible. mr. foer would do well to return to his studies. book written in a schoolboy parochial, backward. i admit that the author has been traumatized by september 11, but not putting sentences one after the other that it comes to good books. no i do not like the style and the universe 'hype', nickname of the young artist american author. words, phrases, ideas, photos are juxtaposed without any binder, no structure, no soul. this book is certainly very trendy in the intellectual circles of fashion, but for me it's not quality literature. i was frankly disappointed by this book, hence my scathing criticism. yet the title was a good omen and a book heralded a much better level.
