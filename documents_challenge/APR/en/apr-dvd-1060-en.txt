this film is probably the most manichean analysis on the rise of racism. the catastrophic scenario, accentuated by an ultra-dripping pathos (the white father "good" worker, the mother incapable fascinated the brother, the "nice" teacher or black companion cell saving) is passed completely by the wayside in favor of stylized ultra-violent scenes (thanks to the excessive use of black and white). the only feat the director was to convince everyone that his film might shed light on a serious matter when in fact it is a simple movie voyeur very violent and very low range.
