i am 16 and i love literature. i came across this book by chance, just because i wanted to buy un.je absolutely was not disappointed: he's great. writing of david leavitt is very accessible and very fair. there are no wrong notes and all the news is very interesting in their own way. i especially urge those who dislike the books sounding too literary.
