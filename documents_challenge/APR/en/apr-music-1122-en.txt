second album of 1963, "with the beatles" still has many borrowings from other composers (chuck berry, berry gordy, smokey robinson ... 6 tracks in all), a trend that will diminish in 1964 to eliminate completely the end of 1965 with "rubber soul". i consider this album as the best of the "first period" of the beatles (ie, 62/65 years, those of intensive touring and studio sessions are limited). it is also the album's most rock (money, roll over beethoven ...) and r &amp; b (you really gotta hold on me) with all their carii√®re before the beatles laid the foundations of what the has been called the "pop music" with "rubber soul" in december 1965. here we are still in the "mersey beat" musical style came from liverpool who dominate the years 63 and 64 (with the searchers, gerry &amp; the pacemakers, freddie &amp; the dreamers ...) before being replaced by the "british beat "from london, birmingham .... unlike the previous album (please please me), where gambling and singing slightly lacking insurance on certain titles, "with the beatles" is flawless from beginning to end. not only john and paul provide 7 new titles (and george 1), but the quartet appropriates each loan and make a small bomb music (please mr postman, roll over beethoven and money are good examples). their producer george martin second at the piano on some tracks. the pieces are short (typically just over 2 minutes), the album is short (30 minutes or less) but is dynamite from beginning to end!
