sam mendes loves analyzed american society as he has done brilliantly with american beauty and paths of perdition. this time he tackles the first gulf war by showing us the path of a young rookie marine snipers. the script is brilliant because it makes us d√©couvir of interior (ie the perspective of a single soldier) daily elite units during this strange war where sexual frustration, and glandage picole not do not mix (besides, you'll see the meaning of jarhead is eloquent !!!). the film is punctuated by shocks such as the sequence snapped and the hero or the stage of trying to clean up marine oil wells. this feature leads us to ask a ask a question: this war was it a big business? make up your mind! frankly i think a little bored and not at all, i found really taking jarhead! the dvd of the film is flawless and exciting bonuses including a logbook of director very detailed. for those who like war movies or immersive type platoon the boat, you will love! to discover urgently!
