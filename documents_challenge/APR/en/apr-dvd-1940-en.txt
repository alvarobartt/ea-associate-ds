released in the midst of war (1945), "adventures in burma" was promptly removed from the circuit anglettere. the cause: too much bias showing the country's liberation by american troops only when the british army played an important role, completely ignored here (except for a citation in the final credits). in an almost documentary style, we are witnessing the raid of a section of american paratroopers against a japanese base, and then retiring under the harassment of the enemy decided to take revenge. led by a dashing errol flynn yet (it will decline rapidly p in subsequent years), surrounded by james brown (not the singer, a namesake who had his hour of glory with the role of lt. rip masters in the series "rin tin tin") and george tobias (who is also the fabulous dan "airforce" by howard hawks), the film is exciting and raoul walsh directs with masterly his favorite actor (they turn a small dozen films together). the dvd offers bonus 2 great shorts military training (one color and one b / w) from the conflict (1941 and 1943) among others with ronald reagan and george tobias, both of length + / - 20 '. these documenrs rare and exciting (for fans) a complete edition recommended.
