i too am surprised by the surprisingly good read reviews. like what the taste and color! i do not know the comic strip by bilal but i like horror films a bit supernatural, and then frankly it does not. i could not get a moment to immerse myself in the film, the story is nonexistent and boring, no emotion emerges, the mixture of virtual characters (very badly done elsewhere) with real actors is really disconcerting and ultimately laughable. the visual essentially directed by computer is crying with laughter at the shrek and pixar.
