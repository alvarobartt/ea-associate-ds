crichton is obviously the opposite of hackneyed theories. the story is somewhat interesting. the only interest i have seen in this book is that it shows that we can use published texts of quite partial to convince. in fact the problem of global warming is complex. of course a lot of stupid things are said and it is easy to show the contrary as the author does. but to deny global warming or the consequences of pollution or overconsumption with a pseudo thriller. frankly i'm bored. it's a shame because crichton had used a lot of imagination!
