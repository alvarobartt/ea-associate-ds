a very dangerous book! a book that is entirely consistent with the current tragic ideology which dominates in western societies, the supremacy of the white (article 4 on the positive role). the black man in the eyes of the author is solely responsible for the overwhelming misery of the african continent. in fact the author takes in his book, all the tragic findings relating to africa, such as poverty, massacres, wars, lack of growth ... whole reality that we can no contest! but his explanation fits into a racist theory very dangerous indeed for him the essence of all these ills lies in the so-called inferiority of the black man! to believe that stephen smith is not aware of all the evils that this continent has suffered (slavery, colonialism) and continues to suffer, not to mention bad weather, not conducive to its development and all current policies directed by the interests economic world powers (supporting dictatorships, plundering of resources ...) in conclusion, this book represents for me a real tragedy, especially since the author is a reporter at the famous newspaper "le monde".
