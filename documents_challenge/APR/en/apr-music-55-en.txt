with riot act i thought that pj had peaked in mediocrity, but there it drives the point, no unity on this album, a series of securities with no interest, some pieces look like very bad pieces of the ramones, other falls to the soundtrack for into the wild with nothing to do on a cake of pj. in short it is a failure.
