this film is disappointing, many liberties have been taken from the text of jane austen. important passages in understanding have been truncated. the world of jane austen is not represented and is replaced by a perception sometimes vulgar and removed all the subtlety of the author. too bad, nothing to do with pride and prejudice, sense and sensibility, persuasion or even emma who themselves are a real treat.
