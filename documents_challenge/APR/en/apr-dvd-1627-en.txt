i saw howl's moving castle at its output, in film. miyazaki fan, like many, i do not share the opinion of everyone on this film. indeed, it is wonderful, very well done, etc etc ... miyazaki is a proper fit! but ... the end shocked me. i thought i was parachuted into a walt disney, an end to the u.s., where they married and made many children ... i admit that the end has left a bitter taste on the entire film. it remains to be seen, because as always plenty of humor mixed with great talent and the magic of morality ...
