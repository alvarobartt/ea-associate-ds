it's a shame. the plot is interesting but obviously the author does not know to tell a story. he wrote several books before this one, but no fiction. one does not become a novelist, this book is a perfect illustration. the characters that the author proposes are all caricatures, lacking depth. it is impossible for a reader identifies with them. it did not seem to be human. there is no difference between chinese characters and western characters. they all have the same "voice". they are only there to advance the plot and allow the author to tell us what he has to say. means more the author than the characters. on several occasions i have ears hurt them by reading the dialogues: they do not work. i do not know many people who spoke like the characters in the book. writing dialogue is not an easy thing and read aloud at least allows to realize if they work or not. the author is not aware of this technique. the descriptions of places are also caricatured the characters. one can not help having the impression of reading the guide for backpacker. i wonder if the publisher has read the book before publishing it. the basic principles that a good background story of intrigue are not respected. what the author does not know either. he can learn. but the editor! he has missed the blunders that kill the story and that could be corrected. he even went so far as to place the author in "line of crichton, it dared. this book is not worth the trouble. spend your way if you want to read an interesting story. if you want to read what the author has to say about china and the united states, this book is for you. but do not expect to experience emotions in discovering what happens to the characters.
