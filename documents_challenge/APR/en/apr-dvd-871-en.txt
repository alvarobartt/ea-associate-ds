there are bad movies, very bad films, turnips, and films that push the boundaries of bad (and bad taste) to infinity and beyond ... charlie's angels is in this latter category. i came across it by chance, by switching my tv without really trying to see. i stayed taped. everything i am about to express is devoid of anger or disappointment, i expected nothing from this film. ridiculous, garish, ugly to want to go blind, hysterical, badly acted, poorly filmed, with a budget that is huge and guess who fills the attic, offers special effects ridiculissimesquement (yes, i invent words) leds. a spectacle of ugliness and stupidity incredible. some say that this is not true that this is only entertainment, and must take it in the second degree ... ok ... 26th level, this film is a dung, touching an object that poses a real question: why? the only merit of this film is to make the viewer particularly indulgent towards all kinds of films he saw as missed before. example: "well, i would do well in full christophe lambert, me" ... at the end of the credit, we still wonder if we could see, if we did not dream, if all this is real if people have really taken to invest time and money in such an enterprise ... in short, the questions are scrambling ... next time, look as retarded chimpanzees eat their own feces and wallow in the vomit (or type all interviews steevy boulay loop) rather than submit to this outburst, saying that i, the torrent of debility. there.
