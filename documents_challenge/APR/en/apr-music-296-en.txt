take the lead singer of spock's beard, flower kings guitarist, bassist and drummer marillion dream theater. lock them in a studio for a week ... the result is quite amazing: 5 pieces for a total duration of 77 minutes! a very seventies atmosphere with an old mellotron and hammond organ. "all of the above" (31 minutes!) contains passages rather grandiose. "in held '(twas) in i" is a cover of procol harum faithful. beautiful tribute. the album sounds quite spock's beard. he must listen several times to realize that for a first attempt is a masterstroke. a landmark disc. to have absolutely.
