eyes wide shut is the great, the huge kubrick. images shot with great attention to aesthetics, scenario with a scalpel, complex characters, even the secondary characters are seen with depth and nuance to the point where it is difficult to define. and then, this is not false principal role, the naif tom cruise, which is the basis of this film but his wife, nicole kidman. it has a meditation on the meaning of life, love, passions that we are invited. to see and review for one view does not exhaust all the richness of this film.
