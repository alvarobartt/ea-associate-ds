amateur photographer i ran on this book that seemed to fit my needs. alas, what a disappointment! after a first chapter that can be understood by students interested in math sup matrix computation (and the author warns in the introduction), it is neither more nor less than the instructions of a few tools for profiling and a scan driver for dozens of pages without much interest. i do not use vuescan and nobody around me do not use them so why spoil many pages? i waited in vain for the principal, that is not how to create profiles, but how do i use? how to organize my work with my digital camera my computer and my printer? how to get good prints? from that almost nothing or very little obviously not written by a professional thing. and the final chapter on the images on the internet that may be interested there? book very disappointing, eyrolles we were accustomed to better
