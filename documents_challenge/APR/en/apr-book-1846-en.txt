another book about madonna. it is true that it is formatted with elegance and taste, the format is pleasant and well-chosen images instead. the book focuses instead on the phenomenon rather than the player - as so often in books devoted to madonna. errors, omissions and inaccuracies are many especially when the issue of music is discussed, and the text in turn, often resembles a condensed - writing course with a lot of punch and panache, biographies and other tabloid gossip magazines. details and nuances are left to rot, and are kept as items that can illustrate the words of the author very clearly fascinated by the provocative star. however, it is ultimately quite common: just throw an eye on all the books have been published about marilyn monroe, james dean and other icons of american pop culture. so bad, another stab in the water.
