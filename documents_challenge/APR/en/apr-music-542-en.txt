fan of the first hour of this group is without any hesitation that i rushed on this cake as soon as she appeared on the shelves of the local music store. arrived at home, the landing was a little painful. the dvd part borders on scam: a few pieces of the concert and not the text? add a few clips and a story very dispensable, and you have some dvd rather light. it should tell our blankass that can store a lot more on a single dvd (for exmple, then see the "live at dublin springsteen, that's something different in respect of the customer) . rest music ... while there, the complete crash. where did the energy that animated the blankass on stage he was not so long? it is entitled to a concert acoustic certainly strong trend, but without any energy rock'n'rollesque. you'd think they play a home retaite! in addition to full title of the heroic age (the flower man or the era of anything (i mean the album) are forgotten!) to believe that this is only a sample together. this is probably the case given the length of disque.bref, i can be argued that for the price of the thing, it is not stolen. sure. provided enjoy concerts and dvd truncated three-quarter empty, there is nothing wrong. the only logical explanation i can find this scam is that it may be a final album to settle a contract and start again with another editor in no time. so i hope in a most improbable next studio album which undeceived me, but i think blankass is finished. for me anyway. allez zou, i shall give "street of thirst" in the deck.
