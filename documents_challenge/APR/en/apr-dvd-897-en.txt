well it is mel all right; he started getting gung ho with "brave heart" and has been gearing up ever since. the only problem i have with this movie is i can not figure out what he has to say even when he tells you. with the probable exception of "all quiet on the western front", most war movies just use war as a back drop to their main purpose as in "apocalypse now" (1979 an updated version of "hart of darkness"). this movie also has the look and feel of an updated "green berets" (1968); just pluck out john wayne and plug in mel.
