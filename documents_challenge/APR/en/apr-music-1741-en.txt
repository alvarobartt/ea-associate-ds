i put 4 stars because i think this album is slightly more than the previous advance and it is somehow the culmination of two previous albums (this time, and breakin away). i mean trilogy here, because despite the album: al jarreau, glow, look to the raimbow, and all fly home, all published in warner 75 to 78, the three albums that followed this good period jazzfunk soul of this great genius and innovative voice, launched al jarreau to pop star status to the strains of the west coast. we must all this magic to jay graydon (airplay, pages, george benson, christopher cross ...) who as king of the west coast of the armed sharks toto and brass jerry hey, flanked by david foster (tubes mister!, gave pure ecrins al who made the classic gems. all the magic of al jarreau is still found on the album of 1983, hoisted by a concrete tube worse than all (boogie down). i invite you to discover this amazing singer who jumps and juggling with scats and has not yet found a worthy successor to the match. more than a style, it is an absolute reference. jay graydon tom manning, and al foster, are the trump cards of this sublime adventure! hat!
