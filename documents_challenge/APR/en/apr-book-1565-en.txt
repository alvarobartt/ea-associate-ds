what a disappointment. the awards received by this book left waiting for a masterpiece of exciting, imaginative, built out of the ordinary. i was more like reading a catalog of nasa. that no action is one thing, but that the psychological dimension of the characters is as tenuous and as low scenario leaves me speechless. a piece of advice, avoid this book!
