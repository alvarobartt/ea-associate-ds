despite a long wait, plus the release of the album b-sides / remixes canceled in france, while fans of garbage again take a big breath of fresh air with this third album. "beautiful" mark here many changes over the first two albums: the songs are less overloaded with electronic effects and are much more refined! the quartet reveals another facet of garbage, a softer side and less metal than before. always it is that these 13 new songs rely more on the vocal abilities of shirley manson, and just for that ... is happiness. beautiful performance!
