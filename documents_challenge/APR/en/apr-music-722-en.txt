very good album that metallica transcribed very well. however, the choice of songs is not quite perfect, it must be said that everything metallica is not "playable" on cello. another criticism: i think the interpretation is too buggers, the notes are not quite related and are supported too ... snon has anything to say these guys are eggs and admire their work.
