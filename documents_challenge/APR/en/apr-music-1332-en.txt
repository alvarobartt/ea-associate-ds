my admiration for sanson has disappeared from this album, since the previous album "indestructible" sanson suffers from symptoms of the blank page, then to offset it released an album exclusively covers of berger (without asking the opinion of france gall) specifying in each of his interviews at the time most of the songs written by berger were an inspiration that came of itself, it must still nerve to release a crap like this, a tribute that would remain in the drawers since there is a humiliation which was subjected to itself
