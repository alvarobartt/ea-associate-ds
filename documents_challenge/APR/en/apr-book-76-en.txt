overall, i found this book way ... the first story: "a world (almost) perfect" from scoot westerfeld, what happens in the future. the story is simple and reads easily. i find correct, and i like the fact that there are two points of view. but it remains no more. the second: "bride" by melissa marr, tells a story "selkie". that is found, and it is entertaining, but there is no small thing which we can described the news very well. the heroine believes have been "bewitched" or "trapped" by a beautiful selkie and causes of complications and a love story. the third: "the ghost of my dreams" by laurie faria stolarz, i found that was the best of all. a young girl moves into a house that is haunted by a young man who has been murdered and who can not rest in peace. it will haunt the girl in her dreams for her help and they will fall in love. it's weird, but well written. it is expected that at the end there be "goodbye" touching, but not at all .. which is a shame ... but it is good news. the fourth "blood ties" by justine larbalestier, tells the story of a young girl who at age 16 should get married. the basic story is good but it would have been great reading if we did not like reading the story in fast mode. soon there comes a year after the "husband" died. i found very strange. the fifth: "caprice fan" by gabrielle zevin, "i had one wish, to reach the end. the young heroine reads a bed and firmly believes that the hero of history ... it is finished in the psychiatric hospital, in short, i find no great ... i went down this book, but must remain in the idea that there are several new, logically, we remains on its end ... in all, some stories are quite interresting but is no more.
