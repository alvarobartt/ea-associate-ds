the director taylor hackford (the devil's advocate with al pacino) has signed here a wonderful adaptation of one of king's best novels. the achievement is high, the filters are superb. as for the interpretation of kathy bates, it is up to his actress, that is to say, fabulous! an authentic film and anthology!
