we find the bayrou campaign pr &amp; residential if it is diminished by his bodyguards who left. his style is good and some of his references. however his ideas are repetitive: sarkozy is all but done rather poorly. a book that does not achieve much and that gives the impression of some self satisfaction to my taste of being the only one able to discern reality and aporia which seems to lead sarkozy. the kind of book of "visionary" that i consider a summary of the news in recent years somewhat futile.
