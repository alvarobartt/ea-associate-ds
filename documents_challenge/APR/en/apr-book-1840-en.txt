jean prieur gives a description of the above very likely, we feel that it is very well documented, and after reading this book, it only remains for us only to think of this passage have, and to ensure that before d 'to get there, we passed the materialism, and decreased our ego! and, what is very interesting, it is that it teaches us that everything is in the bible, but the church long is no longer able to transmit the "good news"! in short, i've been very interested in this book and think everyone should read to be better prepared for death, which is no more than a passing into another world, which thanks to the author we will be a little better prepared.
