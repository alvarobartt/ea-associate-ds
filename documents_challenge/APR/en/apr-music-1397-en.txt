yes, tarja is no longer there, some are reluctant to believe the new nw. i understand and i think i'd be the first to fuss. be clear and honest: anette does not at all the notes and does not sing through texts as gorgeous as those of tuomas. we must admit, the clips are very, very sloppy, and then level dress, i'm sorry but i laughed out loud when he saw amaranth. i like seeing a girl paum√©e straight out of a clip of a pop / rock group, dressed no one knows how. certainly, anette has a good voice, but it stops there. regarding dark passion play is an album to sound very different i think. and to be honest, there's only one song when i joined: "meadows of heaven". everyone's tastes and preferences, so for me, without tarja it's over, nightwish sinks in the scam. then lean more on his solo album is a little nugget. she walks and only the better!
