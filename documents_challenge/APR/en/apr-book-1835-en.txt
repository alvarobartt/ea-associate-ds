when i read your comment, which is quite right to express an opinion, i can only say that the catholic church, faith and all that makes his foundation still has a bright future ahead of me elle.pour you're one of those even with clear scientific evidence yet to find material to imagine a conspiracy of freemasons or some other organization serving only one distorting bases of our civilization. far from me to say that this book is an irrefutable scientific part ... he at least has the merit of wonder about one of the big questions of humanity ... we do not t'on fed beliefs that are based on beautiful texts etc etc ... neither you nor anyone has the key to all these questions ... are you saying that if we ever found it, one of the foundations of our civilization would collapse and there would never had so many orphans in our world at the minute information would be announced, there would always someone who will challenge the conclusions of anyone to preserve the existence of all this for a lot of reasons ...
