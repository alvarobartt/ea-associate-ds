frankly i do not give a star for the beautiful costumes. but otherwise, the sets are no surprises, the scenario is an idiocy beyond comprehension with the inevitable rich and powerful princess who loves the poor boy who is a brave and courageous fighter ... actors and actresses are ugly and outdated in their physical .. and the fighting is not really terrible ... disosn no surprise again! i think there was justification to get really better.
