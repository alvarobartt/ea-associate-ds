i do not know pendragon and after reading a very good review on progressivewaves.com that i risked ... i'm in my early plays, and i must say that it's pretty great, with sounds pink floyd kind. for anyone who loves the great flights of guitar and piano passages very quiet it's all good. i'll just end on my side voice - but that's too personal a decision to be decisive - and a tendency to use big tricks to please us (the great flights on guitar and piano passages, precisely!). having bought an iq at the same time, i tend to prefer "the 7th house" to "not of this world". anyway i'm not here to compare and say that today, too few plays to be sure. then record: an album (too?) easy access, but certainly the maximum quality. what more? this april 27, 2009, i just make a small amendment to my comment. i had titled initialiement "a good impression to confirm, today confirmed it! this cd is a delight from beginning to end, except the two bonus tracks, which, if they are very good, frankly, are separated. i think they were unnecessary. anyway, i'm excited: the melodies, the atmosphere, solos, singing, etc.. everything tends to carry us in an emotional world flamboyant. difficult to separate the tracks (and why do it anyway?), but i must say that i was fooled by a man of nomadic traits, including the second part is a jewel. with not of this world our ears are the feasts, our hearts are quieted this album should be reimbursed by the secu!
