since that time waiting, it finally happened ... the 1st double dvd guys from iowa is just gorgeous! it is everything that a fan group research: from live with a terrible sound of hell, lights galore, backstage images, the preparation of the concert, 2 videos where you can follow our favorite knot through the different viewing angles all the clips ... the concert (recorded in london in february 2002) is a real massacre! a absolutely have for fans of slipknot.
