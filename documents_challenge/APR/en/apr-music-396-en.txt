it farts, that speed, it screams, it's tape, ok ... but when is this-that it produces audible and melodies that can be learned?? sorry, but the departure of andre matos is sharply felt in this new opus, my faith strong technical and square, but without an ounce of feeling which hitherto lived angra and composed melodic and lyrical flights. i welcome the approach of the 2 survivors of the original group, but they have squarely change of name! totally disappointed.
