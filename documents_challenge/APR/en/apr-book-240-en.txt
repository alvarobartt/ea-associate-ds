this book was a revelation to me. but it is also a mindset. i think a few years ago i would not have played. not ready. not necessary. too much in "doing", not "be"; today, it is a bedside book. not that i reread, but know there is going into this magical, relaxing, immerse myself in these moments of happiness.
