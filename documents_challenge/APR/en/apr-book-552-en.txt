an excellent reference book that can be read in with cross-reading "art of war" by sun tzu and the "treaty of 5 wheels" by miyamoto musashi for an overview of the topic. however the excellent content is served by a few typographical errors that a simple proofreading would have eliminated. the author translated sometimes offensive to make the book accessible to all (i think in technical terms as it results in boken wooden sword) but the pleasures of reading these scarce erases imperfections. the visual ghost dog on the cover makes the book superb and indispensable for anyone interested in the philosophy of the bush family.
