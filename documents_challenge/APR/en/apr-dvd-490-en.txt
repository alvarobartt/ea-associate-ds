once again, the vf of independence day has a problem encoding! this problem was already present on the dvd released a few years ago but fox was finally corrected the problem and proposed the exchange standard by return mail. no communication from fox on this default encoding on the blu-ray, however, then i recommend everybody to wait for a revised version before rushing on this big show in 5.1. note that the g is not concerned by this problem.
