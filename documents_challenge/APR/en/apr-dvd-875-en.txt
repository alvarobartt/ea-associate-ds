am i tired of the genre? in any case the 3rd and first opus is still not as fabulous as they say. it seems to me that there is an aftertaste to ruminate! especially if like me you have seen and reviewed the silence of the lambs. nothing wrong with acting, it is rather the staging and good old recipe profiler who takes advice from hannibal. do not you remember anything? we do not grow too much more quickly found the clues before an fbi agent. in conclusion, we can see and complete his trilogy ... but bof!
