one thing scared me at first: the dvd is entirely in english. i thought it was an embarrassment, despite the relative ease that i have with the language, given the particular language of the u.s. military. not at all, the subtitles help, anyone who has followed ever so little english classes the college-high school easily understand the dialogues, which are few eventually. as for action, and many say that it is a realistic crazy! the director made the right choice didn't take advantage of one side or another, but tries to explain what mechanism leads to one of the most tragic episodes of the war in iraq. the psychology of characters, both americans and iraqis (civilians or terrorists), and widely emphasized. and in light of evidence brought to our attention in the film, we say that all that was fatally inevitable. rarely has a film would have put me as ill at ease. perhaps the fact that this is a true story there is to much too. everyone must make his own opinion. but if you liked redacted by de palma and the kingdom with jamie foxx, no doubt that this film is for you!
