how ironic that this book about ecology written by a supporter of the automobile. instead of this collection of biased and misleading arguments intellectu dishonest, i recommend instead of reading the ipcc conclusions mandated by the un, can hardly be taxed theories of hippie environmentalists, and which are shared by 95% of the scientific community. g√©rondeau mr invites us to sleep quietly all is well, there is nothing to fear, nothing to undermine, if not they should yield to the facility, "political" or "environmentally" correct! staggering bad faith.
