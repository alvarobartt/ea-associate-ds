the box that many fans waiting for is finally here! ab offers a full version of saint seiya in french but also vostfr.'s all there: the teasers and the title screen (dubbed for the occasion by eric legrand, the french voice of seiya), the eye-catches and 2 generic (french version by bernard minet, or japanese version by the group make up, it is subtitled). the image quality, remastered, is very good with brighter colors. the audio track is good vf, vo in the sound is somewhat muffled, but it's still correct. some minor bugs to report: slowdowns more or less noticeable depending on the material used for viewing dvds, and an error to report on the rn vo teaser at the end of episode 2. this should make the episode 3, this makes the 4th. this bug, however, is that the sound of the japanese track (the subtitles are good). for the contents of the box is a bit disappointing: the box contains a digipack 4 dvd, screen printed with the image clock of the sanctuary with 12 lights, one less each dvd (as it will have 12 movies at the game sanctuary, the wink is nice), 5 postcards and a booklet containing some basic information on the series, the author masami kurumada, bases of greek mythology and a few sheets of different characters. on the dvd, no extras: a choice between vf and vostfr, a generic choice of (vo, vf or without) and that's all. too bad ... it is nevertheless a very good editing, because remember that this version "collector" is devoid of censorship and brings the long awaited vostfr.
