to me, this film does not deserve to wear the title "the lord of the rings". indeed history has been redesigned with large doses by peter jackson a bit too zealous: no fangorn, the elves at helm's deep, you name it and better, so much nonsense that repel the film 's tolkien's work. also noteworthy is the redistricting undertaken by jackson as "the two towers: the film" bear no resemblance to the "two towers: the book". last negative point: the term ... this film is much too long, certainly feel due to many unnecessary scenes that drag on ... of course he must nevertheless pay homage to the splendid special effects, with magnificent views of new zealand, with touches of humor (including gimli) that ease the burden a little tolkien's narrative, as well as the acting (especially viggo mortensen) ... briefly, a beautiful but too long film "fantasy" that has little to do with the work of jrr tolkien ... damage
