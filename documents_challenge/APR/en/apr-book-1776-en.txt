i have not found what i wanted, namely an opening, possible solutions to a well-being and transform anger into positive qqc. furthermore, i was shocked by some enclosing statements like "women are like this", "women are like that." finally, the book is intended exclusively for women, or i do not see what justifies the division between women's anger and rage male??
