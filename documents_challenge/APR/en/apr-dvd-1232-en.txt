i first saw the dvd, then read the reviews (quick) release "specialized" (excellent). how can such a fabric of invraissemblances, gratuitous violence, aber-level scenario, with a title as sonorous and pretentious left addition in english for "with us"? or is the interest and the credibility of this "rambo 24" disguised as cooked, impervious to knives and bullets magnum 357? or are the police (oh yes it is indeed a cowboy pre retreat from the mafia philadephiens!), or the press is alerted by the first crimes, and then absent?? but what's that "stupidity" more completely disconnected? in fact, the director seems to condone the violent revenge, with this parody: very bad very bad (but very awkward), nice super nice, very family (the sacrosanct american family! bringing the bloodthirsty killer in the right way : see the last scene limit laughter!). naze. if it was c. bronson (see all 32 episodes of "avenger") who had played the hero or done this turnip, i am certain that these same critics would not even moved. but now we cronenberg and his gang of evil (see the movie or car accidents trigger orgasms with different actors!). not more stupid than a steven segal, less exciting than a good bruce lee, less funny than bond or indiana jones film pretentious recruiter who tries to introduce a (tiny) genetic notion that violence fool (son of mr nice-but-in-fact-villain, and his brother (pitiful w. hunt) of mr-nice-but-etc-etc. empty, hollow, invraissemblable. for the violence in the states or mr. moore ..
