patrick fiori, is an extraordinary voice. of course there are big strings in terms of emotion and some effects are a little "manufactured". all this is quickly forgiven because the stamp is really interesting and enormous vocal power very well controlled (there's work in this type and it is rare to see this). but voila, patrick is a little album not known and recognized by critics: chrysalis. a true gem, written by brothers calogero in part and which contains real good and beautiful songs. also the sound was quite rises above the average of french productions year of its release. to return to this album, same observation as the previous one: failure. text level cm2, music on the edge of ridiculous production "with the pc of a friend ..." we will retain the goldmanesque 4 mots sur un piano, because it's the only time we find the unique voice of this singer who is searching.
