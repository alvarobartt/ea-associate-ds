i am paying right now and the gary cooper film audience as well. it is very surprising in a man's role to both sides (this is not the first time he has an ambiguous role of man as in "man of the west, the commander lex, the general is death at dawn), this time it passes through the doors but hung by his thumbs will always be the greater. two great performers sailors not very clear. some things that go wrong: 1 - it starts with the trial and through myt√©rieux a character back over the minutes it takes very well in suspense - but the flashbacks tells the mysterious voice of any true history of the events he has no need to know (the romantic scenes etc. ) 2 - we will not know whether the jury will return to the trial of the man who sacrificed lives for others and i would have liked to be told (navy or not) if it was right to kill to allow the boat to float. belle adventure interpreted by two great players. great resources for this movie or boats xix. regret that there is no english subtitles, this product is special and vost french vf
