nah, i think the album is very disappointing about the music. i was expecting better knowing that the great singers of the time (such as akon, kanye west ...) had taken this reissue. the music is good but without extraordinaire.il is not really necessary to have this album unless you are not a version of thriller 82. another missed back from doj.
