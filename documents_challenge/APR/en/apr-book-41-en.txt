without doubt the best book i have read in years. there are so many emotions in this book ... it is one masterpiece. the pen of the writer takes us into the old kabul, where the scents and colors abound pages until we wrap emotions. it's easy to read and so well written. i can not wait that khaled hosseini write other books.
