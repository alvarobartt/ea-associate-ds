predator is a good action movie / sf, it ages well. in its kind: a 4 * would have been more accurate ... except that its port in br is the flight manifest! a little better than the single dvd edition?! if you have a good hd screen and a powerful drive upscaller: prefer a collector's edition dvd and / or remastered you certainly far less disgusted ... other disappointments br: robocop, chasing the green diamond, bear ... other titles are certainly add to this list obviously incomplete: some are rotten, other means in any case unworthy of being cataloged hd. some ports are excellent as "the conquest of the west", "la grande vadrouille" ... conclusion: apart from the br films lately that are good to excellent (but not better than hd-dvd) beware of older ones, ask before you buy at this price c'esst worth.
