great, we lost a few years in re-listening to it. but what good it did. real music! i hope that the 20-25 years completely bathed in the rap and dance and techno will listen that. they may well see those they call "the 30 year old" knew too fun track. niagara it moves and it's great. a pure sweetness to listen all the time ...
