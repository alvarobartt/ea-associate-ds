it is true that "empire burlesque" includes some excellent songs by dylan. unfortunately the production has almost all destroyed, with the exception of "dark eyes". a sort of mechanical battery (not a drum machine?) there is a rhythm to guns is in total conflict with the content of songs. "when the sky starts falling" for example, is infinitely better live and in other versions like "bootlegs". dylan should reengistrer this album to save it.
