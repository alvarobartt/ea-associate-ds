eastwood is a supporter of bush and his policy, he does not hide it. t'on also found in his films, behind the facade of good feelings, the same primary social analysis that neo-liberals: the good and evil. the process that led to situations that are shown in this film are totally ignored. a community policy, conducted mainly in the united states since the reagan era, which led to a logic of ghettos and is primarily responsible for the development of gangs and crime is totally obscured. so it is those very people who are primarily responsible for this social disaster that claim now playing fathers justice! take your retirement clint, it's about time.
