a lawyer is unfortunate task of defending an abusive man accused of killing the alleged rapist of his wife based on a true story, this film has been nominated seven times for an oscar. if we should retain only thing that would be the extreme accuracy of his players in front of the camera's discreet master. here, james stewart faces lee remick (another one of those actresses charismatic as the likes preminger). we can see in the presence of stewart alludes to another classic film of justice: mr. smith goes to washington (where he played the title role), but here the point of idealism, just the facts, just filed with humor and without fanfare, at the crossroads of mr smith and hitchcock classic, the trial parradine. an outstanding ever released and a trial lecture. a real success!
