i did not appreciate at all this book, which i have read that half. so it's what carries the following account. first, the facts and figures are presented in a very unclear. it is super confused throughout, even when i know the references, i did not find her. then all feel deeply the third hand knowledge. the authors too often rely on the testimony of the man who saw the man who saw the trick. finally, the approach of the occult and secret societies is reminiscent of the cogitations of the five club trying to collect evidence against criminals. not having finished reading the survey, i do not know what is the revelation of the templars promised by the title, but that does not worry me too (i add also that the french edition of 1999 contains too shells, it is not serious).
