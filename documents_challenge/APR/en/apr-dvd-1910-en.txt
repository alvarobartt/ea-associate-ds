i read so much good reviews on this movie i thought a good time seeing him. but i was very disappointed! too many lengths and yet i am not a big fan of hollywood action movies. 1/2h the first is terribly long. frankly if i had not heard much of this movie, i would not even go beyond 20mn! it starts to go a little better when the two protagonists meet, but it's still overall quite soft. i wanted to know how the story would end so i held up bout.j 'i struggle to see the meaning of this movie, the message (if there is one!) we wanted to issue. for i find nothing original in the fact that a man makes his midlife crisis, looks at a woman much younger than himself, whom she got married too soon and wondered about the choice she could do. it is true that the film has a strange atmosphere, which has a good soundtrack and it has the feel ourselves transported to tokyo.en addition, the end exchange of romantic comedies (i would say no more!) but to say that it is a masterpiece, there's something here that escapes me!
