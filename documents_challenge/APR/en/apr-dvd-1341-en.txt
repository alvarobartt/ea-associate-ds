do you like the corrs? you do not have the cd? you have a dvd player and a good hi-fi? then another second to lose! this dvd is pure pleasure with his dreams and very beautiful images. this edition acoustic sets exerbe musical excellence of the group, assisted by an orchestra which gives a great relief to the most beautiful songs. the radio version is in my opinion infinitely more beautiful than their new cd, and everybody hurts (rem resumed) gives chills. but that's not all ... so you know what you have to do.
