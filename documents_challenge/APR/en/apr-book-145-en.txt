this book is a true reflection on good and evil. imagine that this book is an apology of violence or a novel of anticipation would be somewhat superficial. the real issue is our society, the place of man in it and free will. the novel can be summarized in one question: "between good act by conditioning company, and deliberately choose evil, what should we do?". alex, as the author anthony burgess, seems to place freedom above all. scathing criticism of a totalitarian society and exercise for the author - his work on language nadsat is remarkable - this book is to put in any hands. the meaning of the book should nevertheless be understood. the english veteran can try reading in english, despite the added difficulty in nadsat. see also the excellent adaptation by stanley kubrick, with a great set of malcolm mcdowell in the lead role. note however that the last chapter of the book, which kubrick had not heard (censorship in the u.s.) before the author himself speaks.
