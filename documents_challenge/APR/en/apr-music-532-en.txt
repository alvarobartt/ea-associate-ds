in recent years pendragon continues to raise the level of his opus. there he was hit very hard! the best album, at least one of the best. the disc is very consistent and modern. the trademark of pendragon is omnipresent: lyricism and emotion. there is also a touch of metal that can not displease as it marries well overall. this mixture gives a whole rock p√©chu of beauty. a hard to buy, not regret it!
