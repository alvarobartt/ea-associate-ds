i can do that going in the direction of negative reviews on this album, including that of rockin-jl. indeed we still find the face as a rider prison door of sardou, oh la la, what end-to-train this michael, i think've never seen him smile, even when he has an album that 's entitled "fun", he finds the way to the mouth:) musically, because it must be touching a word, it's tasteless variety (i've also never understood why it means this style by that term since this case is absolutely not changed correctly), without flavor or originality, the titles are and are very similar. finally, question words, the fiber found progressive hired this singer:) especially the song "let's dance" (achievements, he'll have that we forget "). grace michael, if you could at least do not forget that among us, the legal age of retirement is 60 years and it is high time for you to take yours, thank you! :)
