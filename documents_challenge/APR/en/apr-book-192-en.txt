i was that i left a comment very similar to another book of riddles f mazza. this is not a mistake. i bought this book and volume 2 thinking of finding new and interesting puzzles. but i was very disappointed: presentation "scrawl" cache drafting it very airy (solutions could easily take on 5 pages).-much puzzles are puzzles or math problems college level. -- really interesting puzzles are well known problems (nine points, bridges, queens, matches, hats, liars. i do not think this book is the result of a significant work of the author. a looking for a few hours on the internet enough to write such a book, as i can find things much more interesting. i therefore regret to have been attracted by design "grimoire", this book is pretty, but is not a "great" in my book. jc salmon
