the author has compiled his drawer bottoms allegedly written under the influence of ecstasy. this allows him to unleash his existential whining about life, sex, death, sex, violence, liberalism, sex and love. the style oscillates between bukowski and ellis never achieve. it's very uneven if not downright bad (see "spleen at roissy charles de gaulle" a heartbreaking facility). sometimes beigbeder knows to be funny which saves a bit overall.
