the association between director john sturges and featuring clint eastwood promised. yet this western entitled "joe kidd" shot in 1972 is a boring film that just captivate us so the pace is slow, and hispanic little exciting. the story takes place in new mexico. clint eastwood plays the role of joe kidd, a cowboy who leaves prison and who will help residents of the city sinolea to fight against the mexican band led by chama seeking to recover its land. despite the excellent seconds roles as robert duvall, john saxon and don stroud, was it hard to get excited for this movie. a real disappointment!! like the sound quality which is very average. this is not the bonus that will save this dvd because there is none.
