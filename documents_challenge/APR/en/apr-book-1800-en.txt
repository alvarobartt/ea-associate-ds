the pontiac gto 64 plymouth roadrunner 1974 equipped with an ultimate six pack 440 through the chevelle ss and other hemicuda, the author has them all identified, dissected, analyzed and restored in their environment and their evolution. the text is full of historical information, techniques and anecdotes, and documents of that period (catalogs and advertising) abound. an excellent book, the only one on the subject in french.
