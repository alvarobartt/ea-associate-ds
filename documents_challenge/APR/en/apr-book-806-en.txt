here is book that may seem time to cons, there is no picture, a font very simple. but it's just finding his way to read this book. i put a little time to open the cover and especially to revenues. but once that fear evaporated, i took all the advice on this count and i went in his culinary adventure. without fear and with envy i did a lot of recipes with varying degrees of success on the first try. now i use it to perfect my techniques and tips always useful for a great leader. some others are outstanding are necessarily good (some recipes have large errors). i recommend this book to those who want to enjoy cooking love before designing a cookbook.
