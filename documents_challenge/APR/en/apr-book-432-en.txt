the story of four generations of one family told in a short period each, at the same age. time is taken to reverse. and it falls on the reality of the book: the lebensborn. this is a story that my school books never mentioned. is this taboo? is this considered of little interest? is this anecdote to the rest of nazi germany. nancy huston loves the stories of women. here a very strange family secret. an unspoken has passed through generations. very nice.
