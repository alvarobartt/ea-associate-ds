if you love rock music and especially live albums, if you like concerts full of sweat and passion of youth, this album is for you. recorded in 1978 during the tour "let there be rock", this disc is a tribute to rock music. the atmosphere that emerges is a concentrate that could be rock concerts, from elvis presley to the rolling stones, from led zeppelin or the clash. amps buzz with saturation pressure at its maximum (see the beginning of "riff raff"), the battery is fiercely ax, low strongly reinforces the rhythm and the singer bawling. the riffs are simple, the ooze blues solos and speed the pace is not one-can-plus-binary. in the late seventies ac / dc was the essence of rock, it does not meet even the stadiums, but the smoky concert halls, and with its hard-boogie furious, he was promised a huge success what the next album "highway to hell" was confirmed. "if you want blood" is really a live exceptional and more perfectly represent the band's career since its inception 4 years ago by combining its best tracks, it is also and primarily the only live album that ac / dc have released the lifetime of his now legendary singer bon scott.
