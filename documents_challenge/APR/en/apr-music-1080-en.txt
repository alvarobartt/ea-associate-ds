this group strikes in the hearts of teenagers. a reason. they speak in their language a reality they live everyday without doubt, at least in their minds. if the machine is well oiled commercial and it is debatable whether the group is aware, kyo is nevertheless an introduction to music. and with defects that some attribute to him, the group stands in spite of all this french variety that turns round: kyo has that quality of being a possible introduction to a musical world richer. but musically, kyo is not much. the voice closely resembles that of saez, agreements are simplistic, the text is common. "300 damage" does nothing other than sentences of discomfort without merit, the complaint accuses that a world without understanding. an album that has a target adolescents. provided that this group is still in vogue, is the perfect gift for that audience. other listeners spend their way, but anyway have the opportunity to hear all year long songs that are a snapshot of the current generation (or less good or less bad than the previous).
