lovers of trance, like me, will certainly disappointed by this new album from master dutchman. this is a reversal electro / pop radical with a general atmosphere that draws more on the house. almost as songs sung, short cut to the fm airwaves. i frankly feel that tiÃ«sto has tried to seduce and conquer the public and the u.s. market. already, the first time it seems to me that he publishes one of his album by a major and not under black hole recordings ... and then - 1 - hurts ... 2, the artists who sing on this album are all names more or less well known on the scene internationnale current, so a good choice consensual (he tries to have its critical telerama or what ?...) and there are s 'performers away from the tone of voice more typical of trance which he surrounded himself so far. 3, (is it a coincidence?) his new tour starts with a bang in the usa. in short, i recognize in all honesty that this album is not bad, it is very well produced and cared for, the general public it will surely welcomed but not at all what one wants listen when you like tiesto! the period golden age "copenhagen" seems far away now ... so maybe he had wanted this musical evolution, either, but i think the juicy contracts and the sound of the cash register are not far behind it. real shame ... however, i still taped by a single album title, the first and eponymous "kaleidoscope", a marvel of chill-out/downtempo that one wonders what he has done on this disc as it has fundamentally nothing to do with the rest, let alone in first place! so a star for him! while waiting (hoping?) an album more "authentic" fortunately there cosmic gate, armin van buuren, carl b, push .. &amp; others for our ears :-)
