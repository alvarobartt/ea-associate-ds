it is sometimes difficult to describe what it feels like listening to an album, even when it appreciates. this is not the case at all this "to the nameless dead" irish primordial. music (martial) and singing (powerful) here are terribly expressive imagery. things can not be clearer: the battle rages, and blood flows. play "to the nameless dead", is to dive in the heart of a vast battlefield on a galloping horse, a hatchet in one hand and the head of an enemy in the other. this is an epic work, sincere and intense, which is served by more than a beautiful production. very good metal.
