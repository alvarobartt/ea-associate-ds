history: in maoist china in the seventies in full cultural revolution, dai and luo, two students, childhood friends and son physicians are torn from their families and sent to a reeducation camp in mountains of sichuan province. by visiting the nearby village, the two boys have met a young uneducated seamstress. luo does not soon fall madly in love i think it is a great work worthy of film clubs, a realistic view of maoist china. the beginning of the film surprises and revolt our culture of freedom. then, this chasm between culture and acculturation, the misunderstandings that arise from both sides. can this love story that begins to seep significantly, then more and more obvious to explode in all its splendor, but who will win in this young girl becoming a woman between love and thirst to know that these two young men him breathe. all amidst breathtaking mountain landscapes that merge with the music of mozart (a youth playing the violin), with a rate bruptal at first, then the slowness that soothes, punctuated by scenes of verbal abuse, physical and psychological which the head of the rehabilitation group tries to magnify and impose maoist doctrines. i classify this film in the group of most beautiful and perfect as i know. a work that deserves to be more publicly known. but this is not kung fu, that's the reason. yet the scenes are boulerversantes.
