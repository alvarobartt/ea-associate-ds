i'm scared to see out every year (during festive) last-new-re-compile the blimp, adorned with one or two pieces that they have not been relift√©s, others are already available on the original cd , the live, compilations (the best and most sober still my opinion today "remasters"). every time the treble is in disarray, but nothing more. here is a dvd which also announced another worry, jimmy p. has the sequence of ideas. i am not a picky eater, i have been offered, but this purchase is to my taste totally dispensable.
