max cavalera (caloric for friends) confirmed with this second album of pseudo metal that is definitely ejected from metal.pourquoi? the biggest mistake of his life leave sepultura, one of the best groups of trash with slayer and pantera. here, the guitar riffs are basic (see pain, back to the primitive, boom) drummer is very bad, all guests are fashionable now because max is running out of inspiration! well done, plus he gets fashionable including rappers, and gospel singer, and ... the son of john lennon with a voice you can not endormante.bref, if you want a metal album quickly go your way and you turn instead to dying fetus, cryptopsy and cannibal corpse.
