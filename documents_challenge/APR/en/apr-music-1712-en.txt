i am a little surprised by the other review that speaks of a work 'late' as she dates from 1968. what she is interesting precisely it frees any reference to 1000 years and more vocal in the western tradition. according to the singer bj√∂rk, with stimmung, stockhausen has invented electronic music (although this work contains only voice and no tape). others see the anticipation of spectral music (in fact the 6 singers remain permanently on the natural harmonics of a b flat). sure, it's a little long, which explains why stimmung may find annoying. even with its comic side or annoying, the fact remains that it is one of the milestones of twentieth century music.
