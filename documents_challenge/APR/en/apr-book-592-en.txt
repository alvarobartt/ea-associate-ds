they advised me this book recently, assuring me that it was "g√©-nial!". well, let's see what happens, even if this kind of novel to marc levy told me nothing unusual. ultimately, that's what i thought the recipe is actually the same as marc levy: same kind of vaguely catchy title, even rather simplistic style, same kind of story. frankly, i'm hooked up to read 'at the end as i found it boring. nothing worse than being forced to read a book, i do not recommend it.
