i agree with another comment, i do not agree with the others, i am a fane of hugh grant, i think i must have almost all his films and i am a fane of jane austen, but frankly there, this n is not the best versions, there is a lot, really much better ....... hugh grant damage that spoils the film, he has no charisma that would, in my view it was at all appropriate actor for this role! if not for people who do not know the other versions, yes, it is a good time, but for fans of jane auster, there is a lot better. for those who would have ever seen, i suggest you rather 3 other versions (the title is different because of the translation, but it's the same story) pride and prejudice - edition 2 dvd ~ colin firth, jennifer ehle, david bamber, crispin bonham-carter (dvd - 2006) - this version is the best in my opinion, it is longer because there are 6 episodes of 50 minutes, but the tops of history, monuments, costumes, wealth vocabulary, the art of speaking ... is exactly what you need; history is much longer, but to advance as and when everything is perfect or pride and prejudice - starring: keira knightley - a shorter version of 2 hours - 1 dvd or sense and sensibility ~ david morrissey, hattie morahan, and dominic cooper (dvd - 2009), a very good version too, but shorter 1 dvd i love this story, i seen and reviewed these 3 dvd and am never tired, but this version, i will not watch it again or keep it ......... now up to you to make your opinion .........
