this book will eventually be forgotten, its usefulness is very very low ... even if you have been advised by someone, or even if it is required (depending on your teacher) i recommend another book! indeed it is impossible to find the meaning of a word written in kanji if you do not know its pronunciation. its format is too large to be used while traveling.
