nobody knows what to admire most. the magnificent viking ships designed expressly for the film and so close to what would those be then? the fantastic feasts which gargantua would have dared to dream? the sublime landscape of the country vikings? the prodigious assaults and fighting mad and bloodthirsty? can music be? or the actors? or simply show itself that we align douglas borgnine (super), leigh, knox, curtis. we could also talk about the lesson of history that gives us the film. so can we learn for the vikings fog marked the end of the world. to die sword in hand, shouting "odin" allowed to enter the valhalla (sorry for spelling). but as the viking laws, because to prove her fidelity to her husband, he should not be beheaded his wife in his throwing axes. if he kills her is that she is guilty (without laughing). in short, what we can admire the most is the film. simply the film, a genuine masterpiece that does not wrinkle as our director today no longer know how to do long ago.
