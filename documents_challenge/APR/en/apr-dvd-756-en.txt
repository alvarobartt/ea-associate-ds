despite the passing years, this film has lost none of its bite. the breaks in narrative chronology are well controlled and the staging is always bold but never flashy. of course, kubrick's influence is evident on several occasions. tarantino has also repeatedly said that "the killing" was one of his favorite films noir. however, he plagiarizes not the style of the great stanley. i would rather say it inspires them to better release their own potential by adding what i think makes it special, namely the second degree. a second level can take many forms, but usually occurs through a referentiality both scholarly and entertaining. there is also an art of dialogue absolutely jubilant. the opening scene in which mister pink said with a papal seriousness: "i do not believe in tipping" is a wonderful example. i also have a soft spot for a replica of mister blonde: "are you gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?" moreover, to maximize the impact of such spread, tarantino was offered a deluxe cast including the two most beautiful pearls are probably the hilarious steve buscemi and michael madsen irresistible, man for whom the word " cool "was invented! in fact, everything is perfect in this thriller. there is nothing to remove, nothing to add. it is a moment of pure grace. just to talk, i already wanted to see him!
