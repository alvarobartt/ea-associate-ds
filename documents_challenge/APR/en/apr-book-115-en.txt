i kept a vivid memory of attali analyzes the music or the work published there a while. since i had followed, i was content to follow the echoes of his reputation as a thinker's great that i thought deserved. i bought "a brief history of the future" with confidence. what a disappointment. what happened to attali? who will he believe that the long list of civilizations that preceded us (but a listing of over 160 pages anyway, how boring ...) is anything but filling in for a general public despised? as for the famous "universal laws" their high-sounding titles they can to hide the superficial analysis and poor argument?. all this is empty and the future use of peremptory throughout the 2nd part is almost embarrassing. finally, the verbal order will there be enough to compel the future to comply with these fantasies? appalling.
