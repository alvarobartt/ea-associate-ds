after a series of excellent albums all over each other, the group of roger mcguinn acc√©lrateur release the album and issue a plea, but not devoid of charm. there are of course the eponymous ballad, crystalline and overwhelming. title proved more anecdotal but pleasant ( "fido", "oil in my lamp"), but these are the times that are spared, the game must play the beautiful versions of the poignant "tulsa country" and that, while withholding of "deportee" by woody guthrie. the rest is rather spoiled, too see the long version of a classic dylan and boring (from the first listen, not bad!) "jesus is just alright". not a wonder, not a stew but not (as we have read elsewhere).
