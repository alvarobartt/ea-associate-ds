certainly, the middle east want more and more hollywood. after the excellent but slightly austere "syriana" in recent memory, now that ridley scott in person looks at this part of the world oh so complex based on the book, it seems incredible, a journalist with the washington post and offering themselves as headliners nothing less than russell crowe and di caprio. personally, i love films of this kind have the courage and audacity to lug frontally the most burning issues. in this case, it is of course terrorism and the sometimes murky way in which the united states on fighting. i did made a joy to see in advance the geopolitical thriller crossed with great pleasure and i have to say that my expectations were fully met. "body of lies" is simply amazing. at once dramatic and profound, it manages to treat his subject without the slightest manichaeism. the plot is sufficiently "public" to please fans of grand spectacle and at the same time subtle enough to satisfy the audience a bit more demanding. as actors, they are all convincing, including di caprio continues its metamorphosis began with "blood diamond" and gives his character credibility remarkable. if the latest james bond you are bitterly disappointed, "this is an opportunity to comfort you! you will find everything that makes a successful spy movie: action, suspense, an intelligent plot, a little romance and a sober look at the world today. thank you, ridley scott!
