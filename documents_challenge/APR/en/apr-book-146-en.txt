i would first note 3 stars, disappointed at the third part of the novel, when the parallel story continues sarah. the marital woes of julia annoyed me, the cliches about the french, americans, italians me tired and late, too "harlequin" and not quite worked, i really did not leave a good impression. nevertheless, it is a book that deserves 4 stars: the description of the raid to the interior by a little girl is absolutely poignant anguish felt with sarah to the idea that michael is in the closet is untenable, writing tatiana de rosnay is at these moments, very effective, no-frills, no-frills, fully performing his "evoir memory" (see the beginning of the book). the story is imagined bin it "falls within" and, finally, yes, "sarah's key" is a good book.
