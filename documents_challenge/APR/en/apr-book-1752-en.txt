the authors are in full contemplation of the high-averaging and it shows ... instead of a thriller can not stop reading pages and pages of descriptions and historical details that drown a story that could have been hallett, but ultimately finds himself overwhelmed by the context and history. certainly the world of the middle ages, hard and dark is exciting, but the plot slow forward, dragging with it too heavy and cumbersome pages, flooded enumerations and details. the characters are just an excuse for the release of scholarships from the authors. it reads like a historical essay, not a novel. after a hundred pages it starts to tire. the plot and story are completely unfortunately drowned in the eleventh century, a history which the authors preferred to concentrate.
