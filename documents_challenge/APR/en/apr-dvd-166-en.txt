the film by denys arcand follows the story of the gospels step by step, by transposing it into a modern hotel, and the story of a troupe of actors hired by the church for the passion play in the gardens. the show shocked the church authorities who are all for the ban after ordering. the life and destiny of this company of actors and the main character, embodying jesus, gradually shaping the lives and destiny of the historical jesus and his community: the temptations (in the person of a devil incarnate by a corporate lawyer), the merchants of the temple (ad), the sanhedrin (catholic priests), and even the resurrection (as organ donation) and the perpetuation of the church of the memory of its founder, find themselves cleverly transposed into the fabric of the film. not a heavy, humor mixed with seriousness, as one of the best short film contemporary rereading of the text of the gospels. the symbols are exposed in the story still never win, or give lessons in religion and morals. it is both an entertaining film, a "catechism" fun and a beautiful and moving story.
