forget the critics, this 4th opus is successful. coldplay renews itself through a polished production where the strings are ubiquitous without altering the spirit of the group. even the packaging changed from previous deliveries: format and cover (it no harm 'there is no words inside). in addition he is a true album, homogeneous (we find the same theme song at the beginning and end, several pieces are constructed as pairs that s 'bind admirably) and not a succession of singles. about single after "violet hill" should follow "lovers in japan" and "viva la vida". happy listening.
