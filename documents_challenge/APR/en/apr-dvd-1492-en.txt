i kept this movie 2 special memories: first, the music of francois de roubaix, then charles bronson and his 5-franc pieces dipped in a glass of water without overflowing. i was not disappointed seeing him. a fairly standard pattern of duel between the delon and bronson works well and ended more or less turn into complicity. but the film is not only a story of men. the male duo to his female counterpart, albeit less present on the screen but plays a crucial role in this story well put together. success is complete, but what is more natural with 2 great actors, good supporting roles such as bernard fresson and brigitte fossey, a writer as talented as sebastien japrisot and excellent francois de roubaix to music, even if we regret the absence of secondary themes, it is true that the generic, very martial and again 2 times in the film is particularly successful.
