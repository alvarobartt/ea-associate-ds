this album is actually quite innovative, both in terms of textures, compositions and lyrics of course (as they are written in a hybrid language by the singer) and interpretation (the guitar is played with a bow) and passion for these reasons there. the general atmosphere is calm, cottony, and mesmerizing. some songs are really great, halfway between pop and trip hop. but the album tends to be boring on the length, the songs may be too ethereal to capture the attention really.
