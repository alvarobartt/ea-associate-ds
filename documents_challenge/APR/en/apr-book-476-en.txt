well, i liked the ants of the same author, where we felt there was a real work of both writing and research. but there really is very disappointing, a story that does not hold up a second one has the impression that werber had a basic idea which is the cycle of life and origin of intelligent life on which he has launched headlong without really work the rest of the story, playing on its reputation for selling and not the quality of the narrative. well, no one will take me more.
