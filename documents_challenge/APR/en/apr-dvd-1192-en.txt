pseudo erotic thriller .. we expected much better jane campion. scenario does not share the road and in every direction. meg ryan is, as usual, bland and anything but convincing in his role. is the dark aesthetic of east village and some scenes (sensual) where the contract of mark ruffalo ascends the level of the film.
