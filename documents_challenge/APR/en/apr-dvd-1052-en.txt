x is for me one of the best manga animated exist. but i offer this to its low rating collector box. i had the opportunity to see the normal box and collector's box, and i felt real disappointment in discovering it. first, dvds are not contained in normal dvd case (as in the original box), but in a digipack which is certainly smaller, but much less practical if one wants to take a single dvd. then, the main menu of each dvd is accompanied by the most sumptuous music end of episode (as in the standard package) but by a common background music and little creaky listenable (although i admit the primary purpose of a main menu does not linger to hear the music). finally, the bonus of this collector's edition is certainly interesting, but really far from being indispensable, in fact, apart from the making-of (16 minutes), the complete records are no longer needed when we watched all the episodes and music taken from the soundtrack of the manga is definitely not the best. the general appearance of the cabinet is also not very special compared to the other box. in conclusion i suggest you rather buy the normal kit, you save money and then there will be nothing disappointing about this sublime x.
