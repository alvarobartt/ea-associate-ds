the first film of mel brooks, and according to his tastes may prefer frankenstein junior or sheriff is in prison, 3 of them are masterpieces. this film is timeless: brilliant actors (zero mostel is hallucinating from excess and gene wilder gene wilder is ... finally!), an unlikely story, sassy and hilarious. imagine a musical in praise of hitler staged by a producer wishing to voluntarily failed to grow. all the characters are great since the director dragqueen to the author of the play, nazi soldier hidden in the u.s. ... what a pity that only the top 5 films are brooks of the barrel! so avoid the remake (though sympathetic, is a remake) and watch the original film unforgettable.
