while the first x-men had the affection of talented brian singer, the wolverine feels the spin-off opportunistic brainless. there is nothing wrong with "unplug your brain" but wolverine has no cohesion, and the scenes enchainent the climax without really deepening his subject so that the film becomes laughable despite himself. ideal for an evening "dvd-pizza-beer", he will remain in the pantheon of marvel franchises on the cheap.
