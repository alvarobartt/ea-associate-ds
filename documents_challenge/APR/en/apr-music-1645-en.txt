the hype around this album, its position at the top of gondola makes me nostalgic. at 94, i worked my math class listening selected ambient works vol ii, i drank tea "blue mountain", it was two hours in the morning and i was tired but happy. today, james rd must be like me: he has to pay taxes. rather buy his old albums and ep. pop artists are not like fine wine. them, they turn sour.
