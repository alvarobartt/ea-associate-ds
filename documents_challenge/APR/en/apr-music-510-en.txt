of course this album is beautifully produced (overproduced?), sounds sublime and the singer has a beautiful voice. but it was just the feeling of having bought a very nice package for a little vide.alors ok computer is it's alter-ego of dark side of the moon ?.... of course! (i always loved the jokes.) let us to the vexed question: radio head is it rock? if one considers that u2 is a rock band, then yes! too! it is true that this album exudes a strong dose of melancholy, of darkness, but also a lot of trouble ... i think the fans of this album is sincere but he would tell them that the rock did not begin during the 90s! what bothers me most about this album is the lack of pulse, rhythm (the etymological meaning of the term). for example one has the impression that the bass player plays in his sleep, the guitarist would be aggressive but it is only noisy when the singer, if his plaintive voice is certainly pleasant on some tracks, in the end it finished per tire. good, finally i have nothing against this album, nor its aficionados, but if you're looking for real masterpieces, then go back in time is not what is missing!
