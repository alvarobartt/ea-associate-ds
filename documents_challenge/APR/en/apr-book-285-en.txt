after a new chute "1" surprising exception with new well-chosen, well here's a 2nd disappointing. the news is not surprising (one that i saw the end before you get there), only 4 (+ conventional 2) whereas there were 6 (3 poems to fall) in the 1st. the only consolation a new classic by alphonse allais. why is a "2"? to fool the fans of "1", i do not recommend it at all. saltimbanque
