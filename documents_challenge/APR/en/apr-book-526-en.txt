well ... wherever i go, i do not read as praise for "the chessboard of evil" ... also, allow me to (perhaps) to issue a caveat. i want to believe that those who have left comments before me have taken the trouble to read all of this opus ... let. for my part, i am compelled me, for it was that and nothing more: a penalty, a pain. i should be wary of title: evil is present. i've been lured by the first volume (yes, what do you have the version in 4 volumes, in denoel). i hope, finally, we must always follow your intuition and do not hesitate to leave when we feel that the disagreement is about to hurt us ... the chessboard of evil and i believe the failure of many (good writing, we hear about this). i advise the reader who questioned not dwell on the reading tedious, pointless and boring from beginning to end, for cons, i heard that the cycle hyperion (same author) was beautiful. .. thus, even read the dan simmons, both to address what he has done best so far (and ad infinitum forget those heavy volumes Ã©chiquiesques cluttering our shelves apensanties too inconsistent verbose).
