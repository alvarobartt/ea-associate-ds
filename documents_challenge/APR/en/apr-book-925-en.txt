the latest comments seem to be written without the knowledge of robert, with little known singer but a great talent. i invite you to listen to his album "unutma" before reading: the story takes its full meaning. many passages are references to certain titles, like love plectrude, or the passage under the snow. http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_ (singer)
