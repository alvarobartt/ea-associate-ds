the author takes the myth of the cat's nine lives to write a story full of tenderness of a small cat named aristotle, from his birth until his twilight years. its centerpiece is a nice witch (change!) makes good sense, and who speaks like a child. here and there there are some lessons about friendship, prudence, love of family, but the writing is never heavy, never "namby-pamby". this little book reads with pleasure, and the illustrations are added at the right time and beautifully. however, it should already be reading to read the life of aristotle and grasp all the subtleties. from 8-9 years old then.
