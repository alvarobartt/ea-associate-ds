very disappointed with this cookbook in black and white because there is no picture! and the recipes are complicated - with many ingredients and some surely easy to find in the u.s. but not near me (canned pumpkin, corn syrup ..). even the words seem to come from somewhere else for me (baking powder, buttermilk, milk ..). but maybe if you are of american origin, a great leader or love surprise starry (muffin shrimp / celery / cheddar) ... bon appetite!
