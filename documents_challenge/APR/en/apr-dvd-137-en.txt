i wanted to buy it, because i love this series. i read the comments, and i see (horror!) vo with french subtitles embedded, no english subtitles ... finally, the editors of men dvd, this is what this technology wonder what the dvd if you insist on systematically massacred while not putting the languages and subtitles available on dvd? the minimum would still have the option to watch in subtitles vo, right? (but not embedded, for those who prefer french subtitles). in short, having no choice, and not want to pay twice the same thing, i order my kit in england ... too bad amazon gives us more detailed language, what it cost to put this primary indication in the description? and why have deleted?
