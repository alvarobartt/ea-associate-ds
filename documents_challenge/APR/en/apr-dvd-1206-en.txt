a good idea (situating the action in the catacombs of paris) which is very badly used here. it does not happen much, and this is not the scenario that could keep the audience awake. we have business here or a horror movie (no gore sequence) or a horror film (we never fear). so, you bored stiff. for those who take up end, the end is just the level but frankly not much to save in this film.
