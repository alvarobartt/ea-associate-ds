really hard, this robert merle. undeniably, it is well documented before writing his novels. not only did we share historical data while taking us into a novel full of suspense. the adventure but also tenderness and love await you. the tahitian and english seem to be under your eyes, a pacific island as if you were there. as always, robert merle knows very well portray human nature. would recommend to spend a wonderful time while enriching himself.
