do not be afraid, psychedelic is not at all associated with progressive rock, quite the contrary. it is good garage rock 1965-68, crypto-punk, vitamins and insolent, with some good titles too r'n'b (eg "time will not let me" from the outsiders). 4 cd compilation edited by the great american label rhino. highly recommended.
