i was completely transported, spellbound by amandine during his performance on m6. an honest desire to listen again and again and always see more. the mark of amandine: fury. so this album that mean? musically it's well done, well mixed, well recorded. a good product. the compositions are thoughtful and musically arranged. amandine but is not there any shy, all smooth. a voice that fit well in the frame, which exceeds nowhere. and it is not amandine. it is far from its capacity. ... as for the texts obvious lack of substance. again, that's all flat, all smooth. no work highlighted. hopefully something stronger next time.
