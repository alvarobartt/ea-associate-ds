danny &amp; the black sheep the movie is the least known of disney, made three years after melody south is one of favorite disney films, with scenes from films &amp; animation, like the previous one. what i love about this movie is the voice &amp; the songs of burl ives. one of them was nominated for oscars: "lavender blue" &amp; her duet with beulah bondi "billy boy". bobby driscoll (jeremiah) is almost my favorite child actor of the past! . this film with "treasure island", showed his true talent. walt disney discovered that young and luana patten in the years in the 1940s, and they also played in the famous song of the south. they were the first to sign with the studios for such films &amp; danny &amp; the little black sheep should be better known, if not as good as snow white, aladdin &amp; other lion king! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nelly
