second novel in the bibliography of stephen king, salem is the only one dealing with the myth of the vampire. while the beginning may seem a bit long to some, the action was too soon to start until the last pages very intense. the characters, as usual with this author ring true, it has always identified them, which is one of the big strengths of the king. some scenes are truly a spine-tingling. paper has not put in any hands but a counselor for fans of the genre.
