the album begins with an extraordinary way 'coming up' in his 'buggles' we listen so still intact (but fully discoverable on the mercies of macca). the rest is useless, frankly, with the exception of waterfalls, beautiful (found on the compi wingspan). well ... another thing to say? no, except that i think the album was surely a recreation after the end of the wings in 80, maybe a little 'traumatic' for paulo. the next album will be much better of course (since it is against the wall, our man takes it systematically ...) tug of war but, with hindsight, it is very bad advice, because this album will be 'father' of all walks most syrupy and megalomaniacs that paul will produce in 80 years ... until the awakening of 'flowers in the dirt "(finally!).
