i discovered mr cash through this movie, since it does not pass this day without listening a song or have a look or ring of fire walk the line that drags in my head. the current rock stars have invented nothing, everything is there music and excesses. but above all is the acting is excellent, joaquin phoenix does not play but it is jonnhy cash. i recommend this movie to all people who love music in all its forms. and an incredible bo sung by the actors themselves.
