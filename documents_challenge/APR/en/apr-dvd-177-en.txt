when you see the rb expected a funny movie, a medlet of "trainspotting", "small murders between friends" with a hint (small) "death at a funeral" and many others. but it will not work. two hitmen take a "leave sabatti" in bruges, the young (turbulent, violent, impulsive and primary) and old (wise and rational, but perceptive), thus forming a couple classic film. colin farrell and brendan gleeson (braveheart, the general) interpret without really believing (at least for colin f) these two killers whose irish imagine they are sponsored by a villain known as the outset that it will get a trifle. it's black humor but insane (i do not reveal the origin of the malaise of the youngest of the killers), dealing with a serious subject, or just drama with surrealist texts, ambiguous characters appearing and disappearing at will a scenario sewn with white thread and a futile quest for redemption, and unwinnable by the youngest of the hitmen. dialogues eyeing a little to "buffet froid" is to say, but it is especially the final (apocalyptic chase in the city of bruges, which she is filmed) which ends to complete this little movie pointless, uninteresting , and completely irrelevant given the main theme. nevermind all the fault of the screenplay, leaving by train, and the miraculous return precipitated the dwarf comes out of the hat of writer at troughs, the supplier of guns of all sorts .... title (a priori funny) for a film that is absolutely not. an "useless" more.
