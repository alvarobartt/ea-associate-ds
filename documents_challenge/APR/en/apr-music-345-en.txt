big fish is a fantastic film in every sense of the word ... and who says film tim burton danny elfman said necessarily to control the music ... for strokes, this soundtrack would have earned 3.5 stars, first for the top songs of the disc are more or less well chosen, and secondly, because this is not the most inspired partition mr. elfman's ... the problem is simpler, more accustomed to the dark and complex compositions with humor, our composer is featured here deal with a resolutely cheerful atmosphere, and must adapt accordingly ... ultimately, the spirit elfman is there, but covered with a layer of marshmallow sometimes a bit kitsch on the edge of the tv series, so it or break it ... there are moments when the flights incredibly beautiful compositions are felt and we shiver anew before his talent for always renew its themes fetishes, and then at other times, we would have preferred that he do not even think to write the score ... bo ambiguous, if it were up to me i would say it had to be torn between his good old drives, and new creations in the universe a little more pink, effective visually, but aurally hazardous fall into a stereotype and happened so fast ... expect charlie and the chocolate factory, future ufo mr burton, the bo may be something ..!!!
