"hey eugene!" is undoubtedly the first anti-depressant without side effects. pure happiness and joy on a cd. first is the voice still as captivating china forbes. then there is an orchestration worked with small onions. and then, under what is called a tradition in pink martini, pretty songs sung in different languages (spanish, portuguese, arabic, french, japanese ...). those who do not yet know pink martini can begin this cd or two earlier. and if you buy all three? secu do not pay yet, but it should.
