according to the official website of michael (www.michaeljackson.com), "michael was not very excited about this disc, makes remix (8 out of 13 titles) alleging history and comprising only 5 previously unreleased songs, and would have preferred release a 5 track cd rather than an album. it's his record company who insisted on releasing an album. i understand better why it has not invested more than that! michael had too much respect for his fans to deliver this album .... these labels only think about making money without taking into consideration the opinions of artists. it really Ã©caeurant!
