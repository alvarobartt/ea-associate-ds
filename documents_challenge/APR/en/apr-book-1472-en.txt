disappointed by flaubert, it is somewhat pretentious, no? in fact flaubert is not an issue (we doubt it!). but the text is old or better, our "civilization" has changed so much in a short time as many relevant words in their day are being emptied of meaning. even the words and what they represent has changed or disappeared. just one example: farmers ... now we understand: peasants. but in his time were people who rented their land and collected taxes for the state. sacred evolution! so this book is therefore half incomprehensible. this version follows respecting the manuscript including in its erasures and changes and proper unreadable. damage
