fervent reader of previous novels by douglas kennedy, i naturally turned to the last published. alas, i was immediately disappointed. a plot uninteresting (at least for me) seems sewn in advance, no originality, characters who seem superficial, i have not managed to hang. i've read that the first 100 pages, then i quit. too bad.
