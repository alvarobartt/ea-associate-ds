in what world do we live even if this kind of sauce is called "metal"? the previous album fell slightly the level of classical music group, with songs such as wait and bleed and spit it out, but here is the stampede. the singer stopped singing and simply wail growing cattle, while the guitarist (did they learn to play?) stupidly scratching their instruments on the agreement just as ineffective. only (the) drummer (s) are up as usual, but it is not a percussion group (unfortunately?). in general, the top groups tend to improve, well here is just the opposite, and the gap is wide.
