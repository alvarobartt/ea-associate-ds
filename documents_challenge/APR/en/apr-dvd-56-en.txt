alien is really the film between sf and horror he must have! this is not the horror movie a bit silly and ill play ... far from it! different directors have been able to type in a new horror film, making different opus alien exciting, intelligent, and the lead story! throughout the tetralogy, intermingle different twists, stunning special effects, suspense breathtaking (especially in 1), very good games player (sigourney weaver ... beautiful!), and especially suites successful ..! for my part, special mention for 4, which has a special atmosphere, and the enigmatic character of ripley has evolved so surprisingly, it is more obscure ... ! as for the alien in itself, new technologies make it just perfect! with the added appartition of 5.1, totally awesome, a very good image quality, and many interesting bonus ... this makes the acquisition of this superb package is inevitable!
