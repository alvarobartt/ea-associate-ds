this album i was very disappointed by the coors, which was their charm seems to have vanished ... it's a shame to have neglected their irish tunes for this disc. the songs are not bad but you get tired quickly, and they are almost annoying in the long run. to me, this album has nothing to do with the previous three that i adored. the transition to pop does not really convinced me ...
