i think this collection of short stories should not be read in order, otherwise, very soon we catch up with the crap and be bored. let's begin by aurelia where outset, we dive into madness of the real author. angelica is very bucolic and compensates when even the lethargy of the whole. however, this work makes me want to decrypt this author to better understand its messages. for those who want to understand or want to read the original writings, read together "nadja" by andr√© breton, and you have a unique view of madness as it may exist and such that one can perceive.
