for me, this new opus of the band hoobastank sorely lacking in depth unlike the eponymous debut album the group of songs such as "running away" or "remember me". it is clear that this album does not lack punch with titles on vitamin-like "same direction" and especially "out of control" you will undoubtedly smile but the words are extremely disappointing even if the voice of doug always so impeccable. in summary, if you like incubus style and if you do not understand a word of english, you'll love this album! for others who think like me, that music makes a beautiful song and the lyrics makes it great, you can go in is far from being indispensable!
