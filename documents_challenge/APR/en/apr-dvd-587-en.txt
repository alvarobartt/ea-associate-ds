second and final part devoted to one of the bloodiest battles of the war in the pacific, "letters from iwo jima" is an excellent historical counterpoint, much more humane than "flags of our fathers." the war is shown from the perspective of japanese soldiers, promised certain death and sacrificing their lives for the glory of an empire shaken and weakened. clint eastwood to thank you for having made these two films successively presenting two different perspectives, but complementary. great cinema by a great filmmaker!
