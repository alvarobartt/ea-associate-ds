this book is excellent as the previous ones and does not spare the reader with some good scenes violentes.l history is still involved and were eager to know more. the problem (for the second volume) the translation is very average which leaded by some dramatic scenes often curses inappropriate. example: rick told his wife after an argument "shut your fucking mouth!" then they are welded and she is pregnant! same in volume 2, dale's girlfriend says "i lost my fucking sister!" and it was his younger sister adored! i am not against a good old fuck when well placed but the translator should pay more attention to the coherence between the characters. and i know you but i think rick increasingly annoying and head slap, in this volume, he turns downright psychopath! good reading anyway!
