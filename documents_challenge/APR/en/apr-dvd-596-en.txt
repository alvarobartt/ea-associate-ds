i dedicate my comments to any non-fan of smallville. certainly it is not history fascinating and intriguing of innocent prisoners, scientists, adventurers lost on a desert island but it is to follow the life different characters linked together, since their adolescence to adult life. it's like the legendary buffy where we see the characters evolve in such a way that one of them, the gentle willow became a powerful and fearsome witch. it is true that for 2 of the central characters, we already know their fate but it's so interesting to see how they operate and the amount of shocking events that led to this fate . moreover, the fate of the 3 main characters is rather vague and it is through this character that we can see the evolution of the series. at first, lana is seen as the perfect girl or too perfect and tiring to always be nice. over the series progresses, the more we can see that this is a mask and she is tormented and that his kindness has its limits. the dark side of the character that emerges is found completely in the last episodes of the series. watch smallville start bearing in mind that every scene, every costume, every dialog has a purpose and see how it all evolves, how the lex, which continued to show his generosity came to torturing people, how lana grew pale colors to dark colors, and you will see how smallville has not stolen his success.
