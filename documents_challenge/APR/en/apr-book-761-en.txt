rather well written throughout, it makes you understand the tibetan culture, but do not try to learn how to open the third eye that he keeps to himself, he explains vaguely initiations within lamaseries. it's more a romantic than a practical book, in short, it makes you dream of tibetan culture, and jealously guard the secret practices of her culture.
