in fact, the problem is not the intrinsic quality of the film but the technical quality of this dvd is deplorable. the image is blurred constantly trembles and makes the vision insupportable.on almost borders on fraud. it is in my view unacceptable to place such products on the market without notifying the buyer of its defects.
