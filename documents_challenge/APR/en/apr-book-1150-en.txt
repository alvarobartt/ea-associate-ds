i gladly join you the first commentator. because i have brought to the pinnacle work of the same author as "the dragon of the seven seas" is a bit cold shower. several times i gave up, reading another novel and i thought it was necessary that i finished "radix" because it was not possible that the author has made a performance-cons. well if it is one! not the style is still as rich and colorful but by the content. yet the afterword gerard klein is tempting. we get lost in a maze of characters and gods help of armies in which we can (at least me) not to follow the motivations and ultimately for which they work. the hero of the story, endearing characters, consisting at the beginning of the book quickly becomes a myth on which we place great hopes, but in reality it suffers more than he animates his divine essence. i do not think this book is for the uninitiated in the science-fiction rather, he must already have good knowledge of circumlocution language of its own. to me this does not prevent me from aa attanasio regarded as an extraordinary writer.
