with "audiovisions, kansas gives us a disc in his most fm, songs shorter and less bombastic music. the shift is hard on fans who loved the group of tracks like "song for america" or "magnum opus". none of that here. all things considered "audiovisions" is not a bad album to listen to the image of "relentless" or "iron curtain". it is also the last album with steve walsh, who is bowing out. he will be replaced by john elefante for 2 albums before returning to "power" in 86. "audivisions" is ultimately a very intelligent album rock fm
