but yes, i have personally been a big disappointment with this album back, i imagine that if genesis had played so i do not have them valued at fair value. the arrangements "for absent friends" or "your own special way "are soft and limit the variety, some sounds are unpleasant and tests to differentiate originals often fall flat. not permanently, if you want good versions of these songs, listen rather" the tokyo tapes " , then yes steve hackett &amp; his cronies manage to give the extent that deserve excellent pieces of early genesis.
