dvd extremly disappointing in terms of picture quality and sound. free from all remasters, the songs are more reminiscent of a copy vhs to dvd to dvd-pressed design. the sound quality is not level and only the most recent titles offer the highest quality. 75 % of this dvd is extremely poor and it is a pity when we know the quality of stock selection.
