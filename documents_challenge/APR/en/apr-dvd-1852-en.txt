if you know the classic "an american werewolf in london" released in 1981, while this film certainly disappoint you. the intro is rather successful, but unsurprisingly (the main characters are bitten by a wolf one night of moonlight after an accident in the forest ... what could be more logical?), but especially in the last part it degenerates into a settling of scores ... instead of playing on a morbid and dark, especially nuanced staging, director wes craven has chosen to "play the" action as "scream". this orgy of wolves garou undermines the myth of the beast. the few positive points: the special effects and the overall pace of the action ... lets himself look even at night.
