except in the circle still restricted maniacs british rock of the mid-'60s, the pretty things did not generate more interest, as this group is seminal and essential today shamefully forgotten. under strong influence bo diddley (their named after his song "pretty thing" also taken on this disc), they make an impression by the wild interpretation of their repertoire, one of the most furious of the english scene at the time. this cd is their first 33 t of 1965, plus bonus which their first two singles "rosalyn" and "do not bring me now" both included on bowie's "pin ups" in 1973. unfortunately, the public of that time was probably not ready for music as excessive and violent, and neither the cd nor their rock opera ( "sf sorrow" published before "tommy" by the who), or times when a bowie in full glory, nor their association in the early 70's with the management of led zeppelin, they will bring no significant recognition among the general public. it remains a superb collection of nuggets rhythm'n'blues vitamin content to consume without moderation, which is the 1st cd a perfect example.
