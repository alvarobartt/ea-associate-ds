this is a great masterpiece: beautiful melodies and simple how poetic texts. in this first disc, cohen has created music attractive to paste the texts of indisputable literary value. there is nothing to build on this album: musically, there are the most excellent (suzanne, sisters of mercy, so long marianne) of very good (master song, hey that's no way to say goodbye, one of us can not be wrong, teachers) and the good (winter lady stranger song, stories of the street). personally, as a francophone, i am only moderately sensitive to the side of poetic words. no, for me, leonard cohen, is also and above all, his melodies, like mantras, played on a simple folk guitar and the captivating voice ... disc released in 1967, while both groups fell into the psychedelic and complex arrangement, cohen proved that music could be simple and effective and used skillfully to support this noble art (?) is poetry. indispensable!
