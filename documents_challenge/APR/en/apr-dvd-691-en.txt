here is a film that is the problem: our brave heroes practice of eugenics, they remove any infringing child at birth and then they raise their children in violence to make them killers, they are white, beautiful and proud while the bad are all swarthy, ugly and arrogant. the bonds will be betrayed by a deformed single counterfeit not to have been executed. graphically the film looks like a beautiful game console, you are entitled to full slow to appreciate the fierce fighting. everything is an obvious improbability. lovers of historical truth, go your way. the connection you have understood is manichaean, close to a certain ideology in vogue in the years 30/40. not recommended for under 18, without a doubt.
