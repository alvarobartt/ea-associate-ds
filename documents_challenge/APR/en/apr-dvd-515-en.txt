imagine a movie: a grandmother who can invasive speak their sores and who prefers animals to children. a careerist wife, impatient and frigid castrating. her daughter student, pro-hippie-hippie, who induces the most possible money to his parents while criticizing capitalism. macquerelle a mother who uses girls from the east. and in the face of men, their husbands or lovers, and mild patients who fail to meet their whims and eternal dissatisfaction. you would have seen a film (and rightly) as deeply mysogyne. in chaos, you reverse the roles, you make every man present at the display at best a bastard at worst a garbage, each woman victim, and you have a film that pleases the public. after the woman-object, we enter the era of man-abject. on many points i found relevant chaos. this slight caricature of the company to better highlight the problems. what bothers me, by cons is that the film pulls in one direction. it's a reckoning until the final scene, where the message boils down to "live among women away from men." i have a great aversion to theories of alain soral smokers and eric zemmour concerning women. i have as much to the enemy camp.
