very exciting for its abundance of characters, places and intrigue, this book is nevertheless disappointing. after the first hundred pages, the author begins to use and abuse of process of writing repetitive (short chapters alternating between the three son and two of history, nearly all ending on a cliffhanger easy), the psychology of the characters gradually withers away to become completely non-existent in the last third of the book, the action scenes and revelations accumulate irregularly. in short we are glad to see the end for what was going to be an epic space opera and the novel turns innovative station. and once digested the tumult of events and characters, it must also recognize that n ' there's nothing very original in this book. number of images, concepts and situations are remanence of literary or cinematic well known. do not expect to find here a masterpiece of space opera to a new genre (it is very far from simmons, or even vinge banks) but entertainment that some will seek your patience if you like well-written books.
