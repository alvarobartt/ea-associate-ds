and make your own opinion! people like gilles peterson sometimes we go out into little jewels and know how to create a hype around a disk, all being sung by a british press can no longer be sheepish - so little objective ... so that some disks are acclaimed and one wonders just why ... yes arrangements are beautiful and good "vintage" at will, so the compounds are nice although a little alembiqu√©es sometimes, but then compared to tenors shuggie de la soul at the time or the little prince of funk to come, it is one that i will not cross; shuggie dire voice, especially when compared to sly stone, what makes this record a demo side and a little amateur at times - he plays all the instruments - the result gives a fairly soft funk (like his voice actually), and i understand that this disc does not fly at the time of its release, especially when one knows what came out at the time, then replay the stevie wonder , curtis mayfield and the first cameo, you understand ...
