i really wonder what is yet to coldplay. i think the first album was a sumptuous first attempt. the second disc brings the group into another dimension. coldplay had succeeded in establishing his identity and sound at the same time pushing his explorations into new musical structures. a mix between pop songs accessible and will be renewed. since x &amp; y, over nothing works. coldplay certainly continues to write some good songs here and there but chose to rally the masses. most of his titles are sentimental, just nice to listen in the background of a tv series (random, "talk" in manhattan csi). and it's not that brian eno will anything to change anything. coldplay is definitely the ideal group for the global middle class.
