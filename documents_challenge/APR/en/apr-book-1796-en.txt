the title is a misnomer, i would have rather seen "a sore in hollywood." some say that this book is a collection of cliches, i can not find, but what annoys me is that the author is interested only in platitudes about hollywood (and a little los angeles, but the author is deeply connected hollywood despite his words), and trying to look cool because it has control vocabulary of his teens, and not panicking when she sees young front lines of white powder. what she describes is, but it's so little shade, so narrow as vision, one wonders what this journalist is to release when his place is in a newspaper gossip columnist (for sores, like i'm not interested in celebrities, i knew better, but i'm so stupid that a teenager 15 years). there are so aspects that deserve further details and density, and which summarize the views of ms-all-the-world with a sarcastic tone which would be well spent. hopefully she did not live like that, and this book is actually a proof that the author is lazy. despite its 300 pages, it reads in one evening, so a book like its treatment; disposable.
