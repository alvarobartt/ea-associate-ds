a film atmosphere much more than suspense. despite some very nice finds (an original theory about jack the ripper, the "intuitions" premonitory of the inspector, the reconstruction of london in the nineteenth century), the staging is really softies. this watch is left without difficulty, but the film is far, far short of its ambitions too long, too far-fetched, a climax rather poorly explained. the actors do much to save history. furthermore, the prohibition to an audience under 12 years is particularly lax compared to the many gory scenes. a film poorly controlled, despite some qualifications. this will occupy your evening, without leaving a lasting memory.
