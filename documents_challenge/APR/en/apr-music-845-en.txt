by far the best when we heard earlier: "kiss of death", "inferno" and other "hammered"! i find it banal, whatever, and i can not find a passage really stands out from others, i would say that some should be avoided: "buried alive", "time is right". certainly, it's motorhead: always 1 album every 2 years, always the same style, it's all ok, but then i do not agree and that is unfortunate. on this, if like me you are faithful to lemmy, there will be no problem: it will fill your disco.
