it's slow, it miaivre is no interest in it. the only time the film has some interest are the opening scene where we see the genesis of the holy, the following scene when he was to take james bond, then the final scene where val kilmer just taunt the police ( badly) made up as an old professor and escapes in-extremis. between the two it is only emptiness. the director also tries to drown a fish in filling the void. on hay in mind the why and the how of history, moreover, is very badly. not to mention that even the love story between the doctor "i want the good of humanity" and the holy "i want to make as much money as possible" is afflicted with stupidity and played so badly. a movie to forget ... this should not be too difficult.
