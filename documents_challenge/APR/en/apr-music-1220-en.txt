after using "sevas tra", here is the bad "house of secrets". this album is a veritable carnage. point of "killing" on the horizon, rather the aim aspirin. the voice (if one can call it that) of the miss is infuriating. as for the music is eternal repetition. but what have they sought to do? we listened to this album, i felt a re-hearing "sevas tra" but worse. no "blood pig" in sight. two songs and i realized ... sorry! frankly, i do not remember having heard a bad album in years. no song really comes out of the lot. some musical parts are not bad but are repeated far too often! too bad! a big disappointment for the group that i wanted to enjoy. a tip, keep your money for another album. when i think that some compared the girl to a jonathan davis feminine. sacrilege. she did not even arrive at the ankle (if one could understand what she bellows). ff
