that man is small, facing disease and death! the grim reaper makes us all equal, over pretexting or boastfulness, roth shows us here. the rebellion is useless, justice does not exist. the brother of this "man" without a name is so healthy that the hero's life is hectic rebel. but nothing was done, he will die, and he saw the suffering will be more moral than physical. a good novel, certainly, but when we get bored sometimes, the story of what awaits us is tragic. the hero would he have reason to live his life as he intended? the last pages are staggering: the suicide of the amateur painter, and especially the role of facilitator that is the undertaker conscientious.
