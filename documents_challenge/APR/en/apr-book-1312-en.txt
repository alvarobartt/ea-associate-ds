a book that takes us into the life of emiliano zapata, in his struggle for justice, land and freedom. a book that shows us a man refusing to give up power and that at no time his ideals. a book that presents a man and a fight, which will draw the zapatistas in chiapas today, under the aegis of the legendary subcomandante marcos.
