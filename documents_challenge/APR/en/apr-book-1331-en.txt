i have read almost all books that have appeared in the first ten years following the war. "the wooden cross-on the western front-fire-the herd so" but i had never dropped in on this library book. it has often been taken as a model for other works such as comic books ( "it was trench warfare of j tardi") and for sequences of movies `( 'a very long engagement"). this book is an exception, he denounces the first page to the last war. the state of war which allows one civilian killed, the debasement of the human condition of livestock, the negligence of the leaders, and especially the constant fear of the soldier. fear of being in a bad corner, afraid to leave the trenches, the fear in the bombing, fear of losing a friend, the constant fear of dying. for him, a soldier who does not fear is a man gone mad. he does not hesitate to reveal the soldier's happy when he is in hospital with a thin wound, he goes even further, revealing that some soldiers were not dissatisfied with their amputation and he felt the same. it includes desertions and mutinies, he approves, he fully endorses the female volunteers. you understand this is why this book was poorly judged by the military when it was released but very popular with veterans. the author was accused by politicians of the 30s have increased by this story in mind not patriotic post-war which led along the debacle during the second world war. there are the excuses we can! conclusion: a terrible indictment against the great war but also as the author points out in the reissue of the book after the second world war against all wars.
