the film by alan parker is probably better known than the novel, which portrays the irish pals who embark on the creation of a group of soul. but not easy to convey in writing the music (too many doumdoum panpan, and pages of song texts), to the point that i doubt that it is carried away if we did not bo fabulous film in mind. in short, just nice if we saw.
