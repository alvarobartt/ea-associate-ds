for years i had not heard or heard of cyndi lauper. i remembered a few tracks on this album. including the first, "change of heart" big success at the time. today in the replay, neither more nor less than a vile stew fm with electronic drums in front. time is often cruel to the old idols of the charts. the rest of this cd is much better: no takeovers interest "what's going on" by marvin gaye or "iko iko" traditional louisiana, composed of personal unimaginative. to save both beautiful ballads "boy blue" and especially "true colors" where lauper shows that behind the voice of cartoon is a good singer. with its garish look of a scarecrow fashion, cyndi lauper was selling at the time millions of cds and was presented by his record as the rival madonna. who drives it out of that marked their time and still keep the road today. this is not the case that "true colors".
