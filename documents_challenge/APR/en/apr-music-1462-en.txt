when i saw the box my blood has a beat, although i had already for years, the 3 cds i began to hope for "alternate takes" of these magical sessions. imagine my disappointment when i got home i realized that in fact this was the exact reissue of the 3 cd presented in a box. the confusion arose from the fact that these 3 cds were released at 2 different years and so i did not notice that they all came from the same session, knowing that the 3 cds, 2 are devoted to covers of standards jazz and the last to compositions of keith jarrett. when i contacted customer service ecm they told me i had better be careful as to what was written on the sticker on the box set and kindly make me understand i go to to show elsewhere (personal suggestion at saving 2 cd could contain all of these sessions, especially for a repeat and it would have cost less)
