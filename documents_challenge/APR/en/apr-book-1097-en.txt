even if i am not a school teacher, i found this great article. it consists of sheets of reading, followed by questions and activities carried on reading. the readings are varied stories, documents, information, ... finally it all ends with a "great" novel. good ideas, not too long for that perfect vacation, bcp smarter than notebooks holiday
