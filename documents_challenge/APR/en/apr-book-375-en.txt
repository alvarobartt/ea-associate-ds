i'm amelie decade with regularity and often great fun, but there not. it starts strong, a good idea to start early chapters well written (because there are material) and then it withers ... usually i find some books too short amelia ... , i was relieved to have finished. too bad. anyway, in memory of the past, of course i read the next. you should never stop at one book, amelia has attracted the loyalty of its readers (like me) by his talent.
