people quite original, even disturbing, that sinopoli: the same press who villipendait more than ever at the time of his death has told us all good to think of his records in connection with a particular comparative discography. his pelleas und melisande is arguably one of his most remarkable recordings. it must be said that the work is at the crossroads of the chief concerns: modern viennese legacy of late romanticism and wagner in particular, dense orchestral work to theatrical heavy load ... it happens to highlight these aspects in both the consistent interpretation and implementation instrumental and worked very carefully. the tempos are more successful way to exacerbate the continued deployment of melodic lines and a feeling of opulence and suffocation as a result. this consistency could blur the horizontal dimension of the work cycle, but on the contrary, reiterations have perhaps never been such a force tragic, tragic color tristanesque, sinopoli intensifying sehnsucht desperate dissonance. rather than crimping detail, much has been criticized sinopoli by interpreting it as a mannerism, he should speak of abolishing the hierarchical distinction between the whole and detail, deliberately affiliated with a decadent art nouveau. this approach is a true reference version of pelleas.
