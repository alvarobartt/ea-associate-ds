who said this album was worse than before? i find it excellent and also bon.le opening track "rising power" bodes well for what lies ahead for listening. you never get bored 1 seconds while listening and once finished and we even want to force remettre.la ac / dc c that has every album he offers us something different and c why today there are still there (and to the top!) after more than 30 years of existence when so many other rock band is dead because it failed to renew.
