what a great idea that this new edition, at an affordable price for the 25 years since the first album chameleon! underground group in the early eighties to early public notoriety partly propagated by some anglo-saxon singers in search of nostalgia. and then you say: cool! awesome! this is a glowing disc that did not fall within the retail media with everything as it creates inconvenience! but when heard repeatedly, ben! we understand better why they have remained in the shadow of cure, banshees, echo &amp; the bunnymen ... which are far, but then very far from content "script of the bridge. yet it does not start too well with "do not fall", nervous and aggressive wishes, but for better collapse by the concatenation of the following titles. and even on "up the down escalator", "thursday's child" and "view from a hill" where one finds a great potential as the intro, it is immediately destroyed by the melodic capabilities of the group. in short, try to listen in full before you buy because you may become disillusioned, like me!
