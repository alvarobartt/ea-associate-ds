les tontons flingueurs is truly a cult film. it has all the ingredients of good comedy actors at the top, lino ventura, bernard blier, francis blanche, head of dialogues that will remain in the history of french cinema forever and hilarious gags. brief reference in respect of french comedy in the same way that great mop or bronz√©s font du ski.
