a movie with pictures and a scene absolutely gorgeous. it is a masterpiece of fantasy where honor, friendship, violence, love, cruelty, magic mix of a stunning way. it must be said that the actors are all excellent, and haunting music at will (despite what the purists may say wagner, i think twilight of the gods is very carefully chosen) a light years away from production current materials of special effects, the film is all the better because the story is rid of any visual pollution. it is captivating from beginning to end. i saw this movie 20 times and i still amazed by his strength and epic.
