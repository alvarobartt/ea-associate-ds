this film contains in itself all the flaws of auteur cinema: realism of characters and situations, unnecessary scenes (amalric in hip-hop), heavy atmosphere is (very) long and (very) slow we do not know where the director wants to take us. one has the impression of being in front of a philosophical thesis. only the scene where two nurses are seeking amalric at his home for the internet gives (his) and laugh us out of our torpor. of course, even if only to counterbalance the sticks and other bronzes, it must then film exists, it must suit all tastes. but for me it gives me no pleasure, just boredom (at best) or depression (at worst).
