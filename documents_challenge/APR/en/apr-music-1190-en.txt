produced by augustus pablo, this disc was recorded with great musicians: leroy "horsemouth" wallace (drums), robbie shakespeare (bass), earl "chinna" smith (guitar). augustus pablo handles keyboards and plays of course, the melodica. great variety in the songwriting. the voice of the very young child mundell adds a special touch to the whole. in short, this album is a must for all lovers of reggae!
