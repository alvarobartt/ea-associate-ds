at the time i bought this disc i did not know primal scream ... in fact a great fan of southern rock i was attracted by the cover! but i must admit that i was not disappointed by the content. it's good rock (see first two tracks) that the stones would not deny some beautiful walks and some delusions funkiest short, the whole is consistent and worth the detour.
