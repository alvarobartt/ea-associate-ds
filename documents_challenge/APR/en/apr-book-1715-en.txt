no, frankly i believed until the end ... i thought, 'no, it is not possible it will happen something! " nope. i feel like i have read a scam ... here there is no conspiracy to bring the world to destruction or to restore a mystical religious truth, no! even if, at any time, they believe more or less, the story ends in a way that almost makes me regret the da vinci code (i did say "almost", i am not desperate at this point then) finally, if you can call it an end. the only words that come are "much ado about nothing" "go away!"
