south is probably the style of album qu'heather nova never referred. at the request of his record company (it also leaves thereafter), the singer must make his music more accessible. at first listen, it is indeed surprising, it is far from the melancholy of oyster or siren, instead here we ventured into calmer waters. the title south (south) shows the direction of the album and the hit "no angel" is a perfect representation. but should we feel betrayed or disappointed? no, because this opus is more euphoric with its pop-rock songs mornings for some reggae. the talent and melodic songwriter heather nova is always striking and especially as each has an interpretation off peers. some titles are irrestibles as "heaven sent" and "it only love". for my part i have a huge favorite for "help me be good to you" swaying to the rhythm. so do not sulk this album and especially lend an ear to the next album storm, more tormented cd proves the great talent of this artist.
