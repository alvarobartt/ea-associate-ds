certainly, there is a little marc levy in musso, but the comparison is limited only to metaphysical side. indeed, never leaving the book of hands .... learn how to guillaume musso will be able to leave this sad trap into which he has directed. can not identify with the character, we find ourselves in dialogue worthy of the "fires of love" with the evil stepfather who finally is not so bad ... a late rc ... in short, for me, a great disappointment.
