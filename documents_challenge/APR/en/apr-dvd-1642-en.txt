without being a masterpiece of cinema, or the dutchman is a western series b of good quality, well made and correctly interpreted. but it is unacceptable that in 2008 the publisher has not taken care to offer the film in 16 / 9 although in cinemascope. racing results, format 4 / 3 shows an image in the background and the subtitles are invisible when viewing on screen 16 / 9! the more damage than the original version is much better than the vf nasal and muffled. thanks warner for this edition botched!
