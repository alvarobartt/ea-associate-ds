at first listen, i certainly was seduced by a few catchy tunes but the album had not really scored. and then, coming back, i ignored the character a bit dated and i realized that was a key album. firstly, a special point is that this is the first album divided into a series of short sequences (except soundtrack sorcerer, which is separate). most pieces are earlier between 8 and 20 minutes, here we are dealing with sequences of 4 or 5 minutes. let us talk about style: very homogeneous, deepening towards the end. it is sequenced electronic music, of course, very little rock for once, a bit dark but not very quiet frankly disturbing. the last two tracks, the best are simply masterpieces, to be classified in the pantheon of the group.
