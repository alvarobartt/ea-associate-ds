i really liked the album "number one" but after listening to the album act 2, i can say that there are some good songs but nothing more. a song like "give him my phone" has a very good pace but the problem is with words. i think that willy denzey had to lose many fans (especially younger) because words that are to be a bit disturbing in some songs, for some people.
