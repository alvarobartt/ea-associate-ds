it's ellis, so it is quite far from a report of the jacques cousteau diving in search of the vanished city of atlantis. however, i fear that we should remain on the books of pure fiction ellis. this mixture of autobiography and confessed novel psychotic is not very convincing, lack of uniformity, and eventually become really boring at the end. the idea of this novel is interesting, i think, but it looks too much like a collage of what ellis can do when he does not seek to blur the type of story. random pages, the reader finds scraps from name dropping, a description of murder / mutilation ... but watered down version, since it is not ... just ... in short it is the ersatz. the chance of a chapter, falls into a delirium totally lynchian ... except it's too lynchian. these passages do not create images but referencing openly lynch movies, whose images spring to mind with no chance that new ones appear to the reader, these scenes are so close to the world of film. hence immerse yourself in the catalog of fears of quarantine had actually spent his life on earth syndrome relationship father-son (on two generations ... the son is himself became a father ... but if, but if ...), couple problem, a problem parents etc. ... so that the reader is entitled to wonder if ellis does not regret, finally, his years of trapping force where all those social concepts had no place ... ... ending with the impression of having eaten a meal consisting solely of heated dishes. once again, the exercise is interesting, but it seems to lack a binder to the overall binding that could make reading the book has the effect of these drugs carefully coupled with some hard liquor ... but more violent and disturbing ... since reading is: will it still legal!
