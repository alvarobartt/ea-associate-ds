despite all the praise that can be read on this recording, and the indisputable talent of g. leonhardt, the instrument used, a "copy" of a harpsichord mietke, sounds very bad (its horribly metallic) and removes many charm to this interpretation. it is far from the instrument by martin skowroneck used in other records.
