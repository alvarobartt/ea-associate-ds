i read belle du seigneur when i was 17 years. i reread some passages from regularly. who has not been touched by this book can be truly touched by love. remember all that you need love! i had forgotten, i found that i began to look like ariane, belle of the lord saved me today. this writing is saving. thank you mr. cohen.
