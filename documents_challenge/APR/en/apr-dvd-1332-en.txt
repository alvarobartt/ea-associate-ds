little publicized, this film is both very hard and confusing. shifted, it seems to show the plight of a mother suddenly robbed of her motherhood, she abandons her child completely helpless and unable to recover. a reflection on the difficulty of the sense of motherhood and commitment, alas, is too little "den", you want to shake these people too lethargic, you want to react to their place or at least the hear their sudden inability to express their emotional paralysis. an interesting topic but i have not managed to hang on your film.
