okay, i admit there euuuh more. whether a first album after the triumphant and childish "hit me baby one more time" i think it's conceivable. but a second ... not! enough, same words, same music, same mouth (each time with a little more chest), brithney annoys us. it's really the business pure, the producers would bring pockets full of money with little pre-teen ready for any lolita ultra commercial. eminem reason is dumb, pathetic and disgusting, the cd is just good to wedge a table ... but there's better anyway.
