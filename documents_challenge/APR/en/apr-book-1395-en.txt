i expected a book focusing on details, anecdotes on various subjects. it is my opinion the essence of the general culture, but also in the collection "for dummies" to learn the joy of learning. i turned the pages, hoping to discover something new, unpublished, these small beads embedded in the books of scholars, and that the collection "for dummies", in other volumes, collected for us . not here. the general culture for dummies is a kind of shorthand for the collection "for dummies". it was a summary of the history and the history of art, cinema, literature ... it's so abstract that it does not mean anything, as the three lines that show a movie in the tv-magazine. everything is simplified to the maximum mache. tasteless, "textbook" version to be primary class, no one learns anything, we just forge (if it has strong memory) the general culture and sterile synthetic a teenager to have left college, that is to say the wind.
