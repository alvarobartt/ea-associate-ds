finally, since the time that "japan" waiting! concert by japan-oil on canvas-in dvd, previously in cd audio, takes a new face, even if we project 24 years ago. event late considering that other "artists" were treated to a re not necessary before them. in the part that we can consider as "bonus", 7 promotional clips (and not 8 as written on the dvd sticker, unless there is a hidden?) but unfortunately without ghost (the eighth clip "ghost" perhaps?) are the videos directly from tapes videos without having been retouched, however, which gives a image that recalls the vhs, and some defects of these bands. but as is the only dvd available and it would not necessarily created (others would say, more severe than the bonus could be more consistent), we can only rejoice. subsequently, while a dvd "full" will be released, with interviews to support? there are plenty more to get out the dvd group elements in their solo career, also made more associations usually time, do with group members or the entire group (rain tree crow). this should be followed, unless the dvd is not being sold a single copy (ah it was i who!)
