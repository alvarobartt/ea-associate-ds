unbelievable, yet true, i dropped a thriller until the end. my first and last fred vargas was him. i am still hooked as i could but i did not come back into the plot too dense, no link can be too cerebral for me. and too slow in the characters and action. too bad it takes something for everyone. this author is not mine.
