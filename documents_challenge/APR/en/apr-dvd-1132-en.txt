a lot of shocking things in this movie, not so much the principle or the easy joke, it's mind terribly computer and mercantile that emerges is shocking. see youn in franchouillard clone of johnny knoxville, dressed the same way, wearing the same ... to see some gags completely pumped about jackass, but having first removed all that is shocking, dangerous, and therefore funny. you should see the band m6 to purposely drop the extras already died laughing before the end, to feel a strong feeling that takes teens (the target marketting film) really for pigeons.
