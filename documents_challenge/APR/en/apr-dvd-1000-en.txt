the film tells the true story of chambon-sur-lignon during the occupation. it's very touching to see that some people paid with their person, risking their lives to save others. when this process affects a whole village, one can feel a certain ease. it is not. the film shows therefore also of conscience, individual choices: no violence or abuse? what is the best way to fight, to resist? is it fair to take risks with his own family? an exemplary witness.
