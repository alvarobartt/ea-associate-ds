it is of course difficult to say that we do not understand something, because it takes the risk of seeming a fool. better to hide behind nods heard, especially when it comes to monuments essential literature. i was told that we can rebuild dublin, from the ulysses. it asks you his work, is not it? it is therefore with some temerity that i announce that i have absolutely no understanding of what was interesting about this book. after i hung for 600 pages to look up words in the dictionary in vain for the most part, because joyce created a lot of words for his major work, i cracked. it totally obscure and disjointed. for me, read ulysses, it is like reading the botin: a bit boring in the long run.
