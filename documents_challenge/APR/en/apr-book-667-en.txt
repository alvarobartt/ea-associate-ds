i am disappointed by this book under very prometeur, but in fact does not much ... it remains unsatisfied, they demand more, more details, more explanations, more precise descriptions. in short, we would like this book, which claims to speak for science, follows at least a little about some of the ways of science, would do this in its most effective, "method". readers scientists, many of whom are interested in alchemy, it would find more "hooks"
