def lep deserves as much respect for his first two albums, "on through the night", "hit &amp; run", which without making something really kind, were well enough fucking for renewal, as here, on "hysteria "i say: stop the madness! the production of this album is so "perfect", the sound is so "huge" that it is not for me, even more than music, at least more rock: where is the energy, urgency the "push-up d'ici-as-i-put-me" that characterizes the rock, and what is more hard rock? we're just in a show producer who, surboostant the sound of def lep, he lost his soul. this is particularly unfortunate that there are melodies and catchy riffs ( "gods of war"), but in my case, impossible to listen: i feel in a kind of high-tech dimension where everything is pretty fine-squared. . . attractive at first, then disgusting after 5 minutes. disgusting ad nauseam.
