"tales from topographic oceans" is not one of the double album's most successful progressive rock (far from it). "the lamb lies down on broadway" by genesis is much more substantial example, while the dual concept of yes only 4 suites (one per side!) without interest. only a few passages of the last part ( 'ritual - we are the sun') can hold our attention, but it is too little about 81 minutes!
