from 9 years. this album traces the troubled life of otto, an old teddy bear, which serves as a witness in the handover of the protagonists. the evolution of different characters in the story, who come and go over the narrative, for understanding the role of otto in the bonds that unite them. including two german children, oskar and david, who was found with him 50 years later when they were separated by the nazis and deported. the narrative oscillates between the tragic events and moments of happiness in life around otto. as illustrations of the author, they enhance the story and very rich just by soft colors nonetheless that soften the violence of certain scenes. indeed, some details very strong, very dark, accentuate the dramatic context. other, equally important but more luminous, in alternate breathing enough hope to reassure young readers. this book seeks to support work on historical anti-semitism, deportation, bombing, u.s. allies ... children welcome with much love this old bear to life so eventful that it is bruised (like the "cuddly" many of them). this is the tumultuous journey that makes him so endearing and so quite naturally brought the link with history, history. a very fine album that raised the questions necessary to the understanding of history.
