the film adaptations of novels can give the best as they can lead to worse. however, in the case of certain books, we must recognize, as surprising as it may seem that the result on screen is a notch above the original work. in this case, the best-seller marc levy (...) gave rise to a curious adaptation. while the novel was leaning towards the love-story a trifle fantastic, the film draws closer to the romantic comedy. and finally, it's not worse, come to think. oubli√©s red narrative pathos indigestible style boring. after roping in hollywood (and coated with a heavy dose of sugar, sweetener or rather, in these times of politically correct), "just like heaven" (which inherits, in vo, a full one hundred times more subtle, "just like heaven") finally wins to be adapted to film.
