i read this book because in my town, everyone uses it and order. this is my pharmacist who advised me she was so thin i asked her what she had done and instead of just selling snake oil capsules, she advised me this book to 5 euros. of course, we must make an effort to lose 25 pounds but with the book, i had a companion. the author was able to talk to me just with strong arguments and above all i felt he knew many cases like mine. he is in his full experience, simplicity and compassion for those like me who lived with all that weight that stuck to my body and never want to leave. i do not think it is a fad diet that outperforms the others but i do believe that there are people who can speak to others and to be born of clicks. i might be low but this book made me strong, i have annotated so that i'm on my third. when one is very big as i was, non-large do not understand or are afraid to offend you by speaking, then this book was like a companion journal. i am a pedicure and i have advised all my clients that i read great suffering on their feet swollen and deformed. i can provide other service that i made my pharmacist. i advise all those who suffer for having lost weight is such a happiness that i agreed to move to phase 3 of this plan, which requires 10 days of consolidation for each kilo lost gradually widening at all. now i'm in stage 4, meaning that i eat everything except on thursdays when i control. i never thank enough the author of this book.
