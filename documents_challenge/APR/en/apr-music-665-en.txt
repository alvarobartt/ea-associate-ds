what about this record except that pianist called pogorelich so therefore it is essential for any disco worthy of the name. it is a unique interpretation proves that the ravel orchestration (to mention only the one), can not compete with the original version for piano with more than one version is as evil as that of pogorelich. the same goes for the noble and sentimental waltzes. a must, a must, call it what you will but listen to it!
