what artist can boast of never having committed an album means? none. that's why we easily forgive this dream theater falling into infinity, a hybrid bit away from the blast upscale their previous albums, probably led by commercial considerations and the interests of openness (more or less successful) to other styles. some good tracks (obviously!), but little things that make us shudder, really. to recommend to fans of the group (like me) only.
