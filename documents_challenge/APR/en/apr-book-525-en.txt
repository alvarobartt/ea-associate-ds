the thing is they told me it was super funny. bah it's actually a bit like canal +: to produce again and again of humor always with the same recipes without irony fine, no real offset, without reading between the lines. good big laugh machine. very cliche. any page of a classic russian (gogol) is a thousand times more funny. what good read humor consumer whose arch frame is visible and repetitive? finally, if it makes you laugh more than three pages, the better. i yawned and i fall asleep on me after two lines.
