wayne avoided military service during world war two, and it shows in the movie. for example, wayne repeatedly uses his rifle to gesture toward someone, a flagrant mistake that a recruit with one week of training would not make. appropriately, at the movie's end the sun sinks in the east as wayne and a vietnamese child gaze out to sea. the movie's grasp of the war in vietnam is as confused as its grasp of geography.
