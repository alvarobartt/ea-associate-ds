we could resume the famous quote from andrew loog oldham, manager of the rolling stones began by saying that the libertines are not a group, they are a lifestyle. they are not only torn jeans and a pair of converse in lack of velvet underground as both clones of the strokes. carl barat and pete doherty have laid with up the bracket the cornerstone of the british rock of the 2000s. no less. at the end of this album, we know very little about the quartet except that the two singers is junkie to the core and they came out with what a waster one single monster. the first listening to the album leaves dubut, all this has the air chaotic and disorganized ... we replay in reading the words ... revelation. the libertines carry with them the poetry of urban slums of london and a mythology based wobbly archaic british intersection of village green and philip sidney: the arcadian dream shared for millions of addicts via the website pete doherty. we do not like the libertines, we are obsessed by them. all the songs here are exceptional, the libertines are sublime, constantly on the verge of collapse, rising when we see them fall, a smile ... time for heroes up the bracket, the good old days, horrorshow, i get along, randomly draw any of these timeless treasures in line kinks / clash and close your eyes ... produced by mick jones, ex-clash, up the bracket is not a good album is a classic. this is not a disc of rock'n'roll. it's rock'n'roll incarnate. thousands of plays later you wonder where does this group since the crash announced the beginning, with tears in his eyes and beer in hand and feeling less ashamed of being born after 1977.
