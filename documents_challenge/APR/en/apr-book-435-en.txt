great discovery: patricia cornwell is not only the author of novels panting, completely tied up with a breathtaking view of the morgue and the reality of being a medical examiner (she knows!), but in addition, she writes beautifully! those who do not have to start there, those who already know would do well to take a look, and those who worship will not want to do without!
