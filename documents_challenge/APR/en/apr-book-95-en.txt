i read this book when i was 13-14 years. i remember having a little "scared" at the time towards the end of the book ... 30 years later i still remember perfectly that jewel. what especially intrigues and what purpose! finally, i think it's reading the first policeman who is now, i prefer this kind. well, it makes me want to read it!
