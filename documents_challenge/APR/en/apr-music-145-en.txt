it was a long time since i had not been as affected by 1 artist french, i thought all fell within the monetary circuit ... listening, in general, very little radio, it must be admitted that for 1 time, it allowed me to discover qqchose sensational (although not very new, i am sometimes 1 long time to relax on good things:) .. pat benatar knows how to combine the scope of his words with graceful melodies and not 1 moment, this might seem strange to us .. that this flower is blue, quite the contrary, every moment of life is revisited rightly in 1 perspective far beyond me .. we can all recognize, be like our own family, and it gives a touch of elegance and humor in 1 world becomes very monotonous musically and humanly .. long live pat benatar .. hi artist ..
