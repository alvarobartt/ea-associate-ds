and yes, i'm going to review my story further support that there is only so far. maiden made us believe with the return of bruce and brave new world he had discovered the flame (not bnw is that great, but it was a good return should have been improving after the test) but not. they bind the album dull and insipid. it hurts inside when you think the last great album the iron maiden in 1988 and he will no doubt. 2 stars for some good tunes, and benjamin breeg for production a bit more modern and powerful than usual. breakfast aside, for fans disappointed maiden, there is the first album bloodbound (attention is very influenced qd mÃªme), who released the album that maiden would have to leave the place of no prayer
