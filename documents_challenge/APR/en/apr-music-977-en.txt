i'll be "hard" with what has been said about this disque.non, i am sorry to disappoint you but this work is over-estimated. i was so crammed with comments on it when i listened, i found the mixture very banal, too "technical." eno is a precursor, it is undeniable cons emotionally by turn - rather be based on records "ambient" (often composed in collaboration with other artists such as budd, hassel or crimson) which are, in my humble opinion infinitely richer than the stone.
