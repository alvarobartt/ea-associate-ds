a story whose bases seem promising: humans go to war against the first extraterrestrial intelligence they encounter. they send elite commandos, selected both for their physical abilities as for their intelligence, to capture many kinds of black holes which can travel beyond the speed of light ( "collapsar jump), and protect them in the amount of base defense. where it becomes intriguing is that each of the campaigns, the soldiers sent behind will live "slower" than the rest of the world, he passed a year when other age of 100. each year, they are also enemies who have progressed technologically than 100 years. how survivors are they adapting? the book reads well, it's mastered, but it may be a little disappointed with the lack of development of the concept of lag. limit related to the choice of making this work an allegory of the vietnam war (allegory ultimately very obvious in retrospect - can think in shock that veterans received upon returning to a society that had evolved without them)?
