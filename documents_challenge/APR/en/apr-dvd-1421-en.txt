yes, a little indulgence. indeed, when one looks at a "stallone" we know the risk we take and there is a first precaution is to disconnect his brain. once done you are ready to watch "driven." yes, "driven" does not affect the normal rules of films with stallone: yes the script is very feeble, so the dialogues-all-alike actors take on an a4 sheet (thin i who took this movie to make me one little english lesson!), yes the invraissemblances are endless (that is, if so, the american racing cars have many manual gearbox, it's true, sylvester has nothing to do ... like how we can learn things by watching a "stallone") ... then yes, this film is sometimes laughable, it's a bit amateur at times (like, what a beautiful microphone in the field oh but changed estella held between two planes! etc. .)... so why only a rating of 2 stars? well because "stallone" is not the best, far away (harlin and stallone had done better with cliffhanger) ... firstly because usually the invraissemblances of "stallone" is more comic (again including rambo 3, which contains a lot of comic passages) and partly because the film is poorly fitted. indeed, the entire movie is assembled as a long (too long) video clip: plans short, music all the time and some scenes of dialogue between ... and a clip is good when it takes 5 minutes but two hours is too much, really too ... this assembly was he wanted from the start? where did renny harlin once in the editing room that, during a fit of lucidity, he realized that the script was really too bad and it was better to make a video? mystery (thin, how long this terrible question is does it haunt me? "i knew i should not watch this film !)...
