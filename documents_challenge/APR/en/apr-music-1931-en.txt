the social distortion rampant on the scene in los angeles since 1980. this album later is all excellent points of view, the punk-rock spirit has never left, social distortion are the bad guys straight out of rusty james with their look of rockabilly's the chrome of their shiny chevrolets and their h. davidson. music full of catchy melodies not let you go from the first listen, the texts are also interressants with beautiful walks on the electric prison, girls and all that filled the life of a la rocker who does not want that it will make him pee in the shoes (i have read recommendations from amazon: no bad words). finally a flat disk or the shadow of america's deepest values and codes (group a often refers to the country singer johnny cash). with this album you can not go wrong
