film minor in kubrick's career, it remains a major film of american cinema. minor because kubrick had taken so long to prepare him, the precursor of all types that were discussed previously, will be doubled over the finish line of the vietnam films by oliver stone and others. the first part of the movie is the best with the head instructor screaming non-stop for several minutes on the blues with matthew modine and vincent d'onofrio are gone. the second part is less original: the same blue to go fight in vietnam. kubrick gives us then the endless battles. the film is still worth to be seen because it's still a major filmmaker behind the camera.
