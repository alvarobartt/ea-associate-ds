the film is great but beware, the dvd contains the french dubbing quebecois! so for those who have seen the film, it might be weird because even some replica is not the same (they are missed by the way). you can call buena vista france using the information provided by another buyer in a above comments! for my part, i bought the blu-ray in england for 20 â‚¬ (the price of dvd single in france, go figure ...) included (and more things out well before the french release ...) and the true vf is included!
