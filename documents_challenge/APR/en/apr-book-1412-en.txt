disappointed ... the plot is based solely on the events of volume 2 and the investigation dragged on sometimes. there is no real surprise in the outcome. it's a bit "all's well that ends well" but the book is entertaining, we find our characters are tormented and still is supported by history. the book is ideal for those who did not really need to be focused and just wants to relax. in any case, it is largely pass the time in transit!
