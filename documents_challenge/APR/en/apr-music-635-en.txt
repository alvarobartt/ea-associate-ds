when i heard the single "flowers of evil" i was really entousiaste for the album! i was hoping they found several titles in the same vein! but as a measure of the securities can not find a succession of ballads, which all look more or less. only the titles are wrong is just stifling that album to listen to a "static" or it nothing happens! it really foutage of mouth as we go out intruders as the single of the album! sarah disappointed me a lot ... and frankly duets stop y'en too! they are not even good .. i loved "harem," "dive" and "fly" but i understand what she has done for this disc, however, started well (sublime cover sublime single ...) but there was enough to make in the symphonic rock genre! at least half the album in this style was much more interesting but good .. too bad!
