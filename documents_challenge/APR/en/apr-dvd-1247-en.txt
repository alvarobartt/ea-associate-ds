please you? suspense ... with investigations that seem so true that sometimes it freezes the blood ... it is really close to the black thrillers some episodes ... you subjugate? for realism ... all the episodes are not spectacular episodes but varied in their content and their plots or topics, they also show the work (see hard) everyday of this team beyond standard ... their tips or ways they use to confuse the deadly face of "evidence" and permmetre their "victims" of being "vindicated" as legally possible ... be like me who is known by this series saw a few episodes later on sunday evening (at least early on monday morning:)) on a public channel and was frustrated at not being able to see everything ... discover or rediscover this series already worship at the u.s. (already 3 seasons and 2 rounds derived) in this dvd collection (which starts at the 2nd exit) that honors its quality to a series ...
