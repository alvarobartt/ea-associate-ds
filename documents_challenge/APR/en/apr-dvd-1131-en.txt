i confess that i approached this film without a priori. and i think that's how it should be seen ... for me it has not the virtue of being a movie, even though this film contains some scenes ... (cf. bruno salomon). in short a good time to pass, surrounded by grown children (michael and his band), sometimes completely off the wall, but at the same time so funny. clearly, the stupidity is on display, but even if it destroys a home, exploding a car etc. ... it manages to smile. let michael youn pleased to settle its debts alone. after all, it does look as if he took the blows he has or detention, or whether to pay a shed full ... personally, i withdraw what he has to remove it is a good relaxation filled with everything you would never (and better!) do.
