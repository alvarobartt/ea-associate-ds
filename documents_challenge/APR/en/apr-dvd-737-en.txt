simply sublime film, which describes all well! we want to go with them to fight to protect our land, but finally and above all peace in order to live! this is the israel of yesterday and today ' today, we see the greatness and pride of the jewish people (finally !!!), but also the horror and shame ... finally, this is not a film that for jews, and i would say it could help build the future of israel and make peace between our two communities.
