the datsuns are involved in the movement of time (white stripes, the kills) although extricate itself from the axis stooges / rolling stones prized by the battalion rocknroll revival. here is the predominant influence rather deep purple is a very seventies rock with the sound very vintage and very pleasant to listen thoroughly. the datsuns make something new from something old (we share a big fat riff that kills most of the time) and melodies do not sound like yet not already heard this is rather rare and therefore in this category. each song is entitled to his regulatory guitar solo (played very well most of the time) and some with additional organ (deep purple always) the most beautiful effect (the single "in love"). the singer is not in the lace (and yeah the others are alright rigor), but still avoids the howling at the ac / dc, all the better! this disc is therefore aimed at both the amateur old rock style stooges and led zeppelin as the follower of the new trends of the moment (strokes, white stripes, eighties matchbox, etc ...)
