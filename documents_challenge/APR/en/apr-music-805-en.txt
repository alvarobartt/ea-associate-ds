incredible! already in the studio, it's hard, but this is downright delirious! it includes quick listen to the "live &amp; rare" atomic that the true dimension of ratm is the stage on which he gives everything he has delighted audiences and won over the square and terrestrial services. this disc is neither more nor less than to live as best-of, which does not appear as an object of fan, but indeed as indispensable to side with "rage against the machine". and it was even more entitled to bonus tracks ... it's christmas!
