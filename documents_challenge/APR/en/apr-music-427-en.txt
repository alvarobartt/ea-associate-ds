slipknot, ie "noose", says a lot with his name on the group of more "killers" there! (so to speak, they are obviously not serial-killers!) this group of iowa, the actual reduced already low, began to attack in the middle of the music there ten years, leaving their first opus: "mate, feed, kill, repeat.". but it made little of rivals, the group sets out again disappointed in the writing of new songs, determined that their second album to be that of revelation. in passing, we note the arrival of new musicos, from increasing the number to nine. and the group was entirely correct to think of a carton of the new wafer, since that is what happened, creating a wave of "slipknotiens" at its output end of the millennium. for, indeed, the 9 does not just make good music, but the pure sound of the mentally ill! percussion of extremely rapid, voice modulates wonderfully melodic passages and "nag", and guitar riffs breathtaking! however, this opus, it is very good at his style of music, recalling slayer or sepultura, the average listener will get tired after half an hour, therefore the last few innovative titles by previous ones. it is still really good and highly recommended for purchase.
