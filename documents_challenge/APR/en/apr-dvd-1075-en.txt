despite its short duration (about 1:20) this movie is great rhythm and you do not s'ennuit a moment! there are of brilliant action scenes (especially the waterfalls!) as well as good scary moments (even gore !!!). in short, a very good film and my favorite is when even to sophia bush ( "the scott brothers") found in a different genre.
