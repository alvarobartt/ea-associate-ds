a gorgeously produced and interpreted: brando plays while sober, camping the role of an ss officer very human and gradually disillusioned by the horrors he saw. montgomery cliff is also great, his character reminds me of the role he had in another masterpiece that i recommend highly, "from here to eternity," in effect in both films he plays a small moth that supports the daily harassment of his roommates. one of the strengths of this film is to be a war movie while recounting stories of love, very touching scene where montgomery cliff seduces his wife (if you can call it charm) is exquisite! in short, this film is one of those films that you mark and you remember all your life.
