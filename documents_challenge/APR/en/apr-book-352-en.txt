amsterdam is a romance so tepid that it was very hard to imagine it was written by the master of macabre and suspense. the first 40 pages are a perfect example of inaction and cumbersome. it is quite frankly boring. without mcewan's name on the cover, this book would eventually abandoned in a corner. unfortunately, the persistence does not pay. the plot becomes somewhat more interesting when the ambitions of the characters are revealed. however, neither the style nor the vague outlines of psychological portraits fail to save history. the end itself is an absurdity. grotesque and so obvious that taking turns tragic comedy.
