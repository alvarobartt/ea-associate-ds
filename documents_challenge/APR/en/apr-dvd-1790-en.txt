fast delivery impeccable packaging, thank you for that. too bad! that this version is far below that of 1949 by director cecil b. demille, actor max von sydow, in this new version is soft, creu dialogue, lack of solemnity, fights with the lion-hearted, ugly decor, etc. ... (contrary to victor mature in the old version) but this true story of samson taken from the holy bible, is rich, very rich, this movie should normally last at least two thirty saw the biblical text. for these reason i take away 3 stars, i would not recommend this version, opt for the former, but unfortunately it is only vhs to dvd by when? to when a version is much longer and closer to the bible? go
