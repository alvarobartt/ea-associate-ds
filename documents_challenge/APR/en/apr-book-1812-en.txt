i used this guide for a trip of 10 days in sardinia, where i traveled over 2,000 km. in conclusion, this guide does not at all to make a route by ranking points of interest by region. the judgments are incorrect and you would miss out on fabulous places. the information is brief and you are likely to lose you. i came to wonder if the editors have actually moved where indicated or has been written from a distance. on sardinia, competition is not strong between the guides and the little smart is unfortunately one of the few. i suggest you plan your trip via the internet rather than using this guide.
