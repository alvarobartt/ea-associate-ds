another great spielberg! this is his year, it seems. script and narration very well done, great performance of actors (especially tom hanks) who make the characters very endearing, and sets an illusion: a smart and cheerful atmosphere emerges from all this. all this is very fictionalized but believes it wants to believe. an excellent comedy charm.
