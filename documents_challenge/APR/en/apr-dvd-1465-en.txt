a siegel pretty terrible, where the director is wearing his big colt eastwood the role it will stick to the skin and he will take some time to rid the man irresistible magnet for women and loving women * to * almost despite him, not for the better but for worse (we immediately think of "a shudder in the night", directed by clint himself and released the same year ... "there's no chance). the role of yankee wounded in full civil war, finds himself trapped in a girls' boarding school southerners, is not innocent men, women, all guilty! eastwood offsets the pain of his exile in intoxicated residents, false virtuous biblical closer mantids as religious at all. he himself, as his predatory conceals his soul amoral bastard in adorning themselves with false virtues to achieve his purpose - all of course being guided by the eternal, the ancestral, the inevitable sex. some hints of misogyny anyway, since in this school, the woman's age determines its degree of perversion: the smallest is a little angel who will prove still vengeful, the average is a whore who will prove treacherous, the oldest is a neurotic who reveal worm! sex and religion (and then jealousy, violence and sacrifice) in the context of a war where everyone seems the enemy of all and every enemy of everyone. some images christic of great strength and effects of staged shots as circular or fast zooms that at times recall peckinpah, the straw dogs for example. a daring film rather crazy, and quite stressful. a very good time movie theater.
