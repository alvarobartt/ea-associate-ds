consider this as an unofficial album: unreleased and remixes. blood on the dancefloor is a kind of lifeline worn for those who have not bought history (far from being an album too). blood on the dancefloor and ghosts are good novel but mj has much better used. why has he lost in the dance when he mastered perfectly the funk and new jack? ask the record company. the 2nd half of the album has only mediocre remixes, while the originals were already not very good. reference zero for the techno remix of history. never again.
