the excerpts of the film were very funny but the film itself is extremely disappointing that a subject completely american; heroes save the world (beautiful!) frankly i think the clips i saw were the only good moments. if i have any advice to give you do not waste your time watching this film is one of the worst disney movie for my taste.
