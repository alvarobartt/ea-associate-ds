how can we reasonably put 5 stars to this group pretentious which brings nothing new and certainly disappoint his audience into 2 or 3 albums (like all new rock sensations that we present for the strokes). the appointment was arranged. meanwhile nothing to swoon before that fans of old twine heard and reheard elsewhere in other times (only better). who does not know the past can not judge this. i wish them good luck (they need).
