i love massive attack album including protection which is my favorite. also, i have always been reluctant to buy this album remixes.je wonder what 's happened in their mind to kill what was already a masterpiece. the personal touches of mr. mad professor does absolutely rien.les voice of tracey thorn and horace andy are dénaturées.bref is irrelevant. i bought this disc out of curiosity and frankly i'm disappointed.
