if there is one series that deserves praise, it's scrubs, we can both laugh to tears at times and have tears in their eyes (especially at the end of each episode), short c 'is a series that gives you emotions, the writers manage to keep us in suspense between each season and the season 6 does not override it, it is simply beautiful, it focuses more on characters and 2nd roles have grown in thickness, much of season 7 is sadly (sniff) last. scrubs thank you for those unforgettable moments.
