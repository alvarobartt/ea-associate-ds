magic, there is no other word to describe this beautiful disney movie. adapting one of the volumes of the chronicles of narnia by cs lewis, this opus stick perfectly and book us into a whirlwind of magical adventures where 4 children are immersed in a parallel world populated by strange creatures, sometimes sympathetic, dangerous too, especially the terrible witch jadis! directed with care, this film brings together everything that appeals to young and older who have kept a core of children: beautiful landscapes, talking animals, countless creatures of all kinds, scenes of valor and battle (nothing to do with the lord of the rings! the resemblance is but let's be honest, by far ... this is primarily an entertainment adapted from a children's book!) and an unexpected ending and happy! short, a delight. however, i understand that some did not like because the film can be so very very childish in some dialogue and some scenes ... but hey, to oblivion film critics demanding. relax yourself, watch "the chronicles of narnia" and dream ...
