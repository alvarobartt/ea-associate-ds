commentary: isasaliou saint nazaire france's hard to find words to comment on this mess. how come there with a scenario in gold? all rings hollow: pale toreton of robert d'artois, tribe depardieu nonexistent, transparent, not in the tone, line renaud via philippe le bel, played by t. karyo, who does not believe a minute to his role, and has no "majesty". only j. moreau saves a little furniture. furniture precisely ... how can we believe a minute to his sets that take more than lord of the rings or indiana jones, that the middle ages? regrads carefully walls, stones, everything is false, inconceivable for the time, even the costumes do not attract the eye. do not bother to compare two stagings, this would be an insult to the first. buy without hesitation and eyes closed, the first version (available on this site, and recently reissued in a deluxe dvd).
