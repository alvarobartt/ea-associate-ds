the serious books on gmos lacking in french and séralini does not at all fill this gap. his work focuses excessively on the potential dangers in changing the benefits, their real gm. instead, unable to find any studies showing the harmful effects of gmos, he waved the threat of possible dangers, that we are still waiting .. too bad .. we read with more interest "it's too late to earth" by cécile philippe, who has the advantage of advocating a scientific debate and not political.
