this book recounts the love of gilbert de lafayette. the love of marie antoinette first, he falls in love the first time he was admitted to the court, when he was sixteen. the love of liberty of the people then that leads him to engage the side of the face of american english. but when he try to reconcile these two loves in his return to france he will be disowned by both: the monarchy and supporters of human rights. i do not like the writing style of ppda (too bombastic for my taste), neither side "popular history" of this book. this novel, very average, remains a fairly good relaxation ...
