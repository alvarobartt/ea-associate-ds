i bought this disc after listening to the radio a few standards sung by diana krall. for this record, i am disappointed. certainly, she has a beautiful deep voice is undeniable, but i think his game is too pinanistique standard. in short, this album, i found her uninteresting arrangements and compositions fairly commonplace.
