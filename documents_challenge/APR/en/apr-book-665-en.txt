" after all, forty-four guests, all prominent scholars from universities, countries, different religious backgrounds, marching monotonously on the screen monologue without ever knowing that what question they answer, without being never see them discuss among themselves on important or contentious. objectivity is apparent. far from leaving the viewer free to decide for himself, a voice, without name or title, but seen as the voice of truth, draws conclusions that whispers tandem prieur-mordillat: those who claimed jesus l 'have betrayed the early centuries of christianity, for their "collaboration with the powers that be" by the "suicidal folly" of their martyrs, by their virulent anti-semitism, etc.. "jesus announced the kingdom, and that the church has come" taken out of context, that little phrase loisy, taken as a leitmotif, is deliberately diverted from its meaning. one discovers a veritable war machine against christianity, but cunningly hidden by the beautiful images and condoned (unwittingly?) by the guests themselves, whose word is totally bomb. ultimately, jmsalamito brilliantly demonstrates that this series of broadcasts, and especially the accompanying book, without jesus christ, are not history, but the controversy, and that the public has indeed been the victim a hoax.
