i personally loved this movie. kevin costner in this role has cons-employment ... what is exceptional talent, and still looks awesome. the music of the film takes you to the guts, the script keeps you in suspense until the last minute, the end of the film makes you attach to your seat ... oops! mr. brooks may be behind you ...
