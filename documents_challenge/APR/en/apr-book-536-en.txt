very poignant. incredible testimony (though fictionalized). it is clear from reading this not knowing whether to be ashamed or proud to be a man. ashamed to belong to one human race can save so much energy to suffer its next revenge. but to be proud of this race whose mind can be stronger than anything. it appears shocked undecided. we balance between optimism and pessimisme.il must believe in themselves, but should we believe in man? thank you sir ben jelloun this story upsetting.
