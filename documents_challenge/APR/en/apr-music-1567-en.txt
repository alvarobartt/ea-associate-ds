jimmy rogers is a bluesman who died in 97 whose fame had not really passed blueseux circles and fine city of chicago. so this is a cohort of stars and real (jagger, richards, still, plant and page, ...) to come give a hand and together they produce a masterpiece. this is blues and it's fabulous. gonna shoot you right down, with cronies plant and page is probably a ds title that contains the most energy of rock music. the other titles are in proportion, c ' is a riot of energy, feeling and talent. the merger of young stars with the old masters of blues and a combination (d) amazing. a thousand times recommended.
