we are in 1980, the punk who had invaded the airwaves 3 years earlier tends s'esouffl√©e, the disco also loses speed (there is a god anyway!) and rock music has lost one of its iron lance, bon scott died. how ac / dc will he cope, especially after a monstrous album (highway to hell) who will sit their success. who is going to replace the "bonfire" nobody can replace him, just may be his successor. yet, ac / dc will stand up and lay the best album and best rock and roll. brian johnson's voice comes and goes as if a special glove with "melodies" of young brothers. with hells bells in the introduction, the atmosphere is laid. the rock'n roll is dead, long live rock'n roll! all the pieces together are among the best compositions of the group, striking, sounding, in short everything we love in music! because as the song goes: the rock'n roll is not noise pollution!
