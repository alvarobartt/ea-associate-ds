this is a tour de force that arrived to captivate the audience for over three hours for a story that happens in a submarine for 99% of the time! this, in my opinion, the best war film i've seen so far: it's simple, it becomes a submariner during world war ii for three hours, we saw the guy with the boat, it's incredible! how many twists, turns of events, brief, words fail me to describe the mastery of this film. a must see!
