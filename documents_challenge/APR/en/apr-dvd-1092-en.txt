transpose "hamlet" in new york of the late 20th century could be a good idea, since the work of shakespeare addresses many modern themes. but it would have had to go after the idea (as transposition similar to "romeo and juliet" in "west side story" in 1960) retain the original text, for the most part. the actors are not up to the task. the whole remains static, while the history is full of action.
