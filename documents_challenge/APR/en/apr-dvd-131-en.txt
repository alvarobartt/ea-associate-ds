oscar for best screenplay, perfect rebound, as i am perhaps too promised? the fact is that while the film is based on testimony, and that everyone ecstatic over the discovery that this testimony was true ... wrong. ouahhhhh! a lie. great? no, it's bogus to wish ... avoid this pseudo thriller insubstantial, like a dull autumn rain.
