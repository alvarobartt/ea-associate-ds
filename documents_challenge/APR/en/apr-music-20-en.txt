i, we can not say that rap is my cup of tea. and yet i loved this album (with the exception of one or two songs). a good mix of styles, missy elliot french to me. special mention for "here i am" that i adore and who reminds me of beenie man. a nice album to reconcile, even making love rap to those who hate!
