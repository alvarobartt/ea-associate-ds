this film is a film part in the career of john wayne. it is a movie less warlike than most of his western films so it's almost an environmental film. he tells the daily life of a buffalo hunter and his team. is a fee simple entertaining movie that makes you want to breathe fresh air. tjrs confess that i have really enjoyed watching this movie. my advice to air as much as we can take pleasure in seeing this movie
