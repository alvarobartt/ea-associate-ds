as much as i loved lost in translation for its delicacy and depth, as virgin suicide left me completely indifferent. it's a bit too conventional and not very intimate. emotionally, morale among girls is barely touched, so when the tragedy happens, it is quite disproportionate. it adheres not. we understand why the tragedy happens, but we do not feel, and for a movie, i think we feel rather than understanding. in addition, the group responsible for the soundtrack, air, is exalted, which tends to irritate me because their music is neither original nor transcendental, unlike anything i've heard from fans. a group like any other.
