this is a very good book to recommend to all who would understand the architecture of symphonic works betthoven. easy to use and very clear, this book can learn to identify different structres movements, themes, harmonic variation ... in addition fragemnts scores to help monitor and hear better. if the sonata form, the recapitulation and what kind of words means nothing to you but you love music (particularly the orchestral works of beethoven) this book is for you.
