(sorry for spelling mistakes, i'm not french) boh, the series is 1993 and therefore the special effects are rapidly changing. the video games of 2000 have better effects than this series. moreover, it is very hard to reduce the level after watching battlestar galactica. but if you still want to buy the series, it is imperative that you bought 2 dvd (the pilot and the other 'in the beginning ") .. . the episodes have a 10% liaison between them, but after 10-15 episodes begins to get interesting ... despite the effects especial. i'll buy even when the season 2.
