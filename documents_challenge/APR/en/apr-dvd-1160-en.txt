do not rely on the presence of eminem (pre) judge this masterpiece film, because it is one! eminem plays his character very well (revelation of an actor ??!!) and because its role is inspired by his experience, i say inspired because it is not an autobiographical work hard and pure as we wanted to hear! otherwise the scenes of "battles" are excellent and the fact of having let in just english and subtitles in french is a good iniative, doubling as the rest of the film was a disaster i think! the soundtrack is the height of the film, very good! one thing, if you have not seen, run the command!
