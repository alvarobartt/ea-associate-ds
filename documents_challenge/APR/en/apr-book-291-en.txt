i do not think i've ever read a book as beautiful. i had no idea what to expect when i opened the first volume, but after a few pages, i was already immersed in history. i devoured all three volumes to follow! this is the kind of book which you live, haunting and will stay with you throughout your life. i am also left so carried away by this wonderful story that i found myself sobbing in imagining facing the same dilemma that lyra at the end of the book (i say no more for those who do have not got there yet!). moreover, the writing is extremely refined. in short, great literature, but i advise instead to adolescents or adults than children. thank you a thousand times mr. pullman!
