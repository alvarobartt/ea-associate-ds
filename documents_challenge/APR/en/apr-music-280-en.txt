about mika, it seems to be as diametrically opposed and incredibly sliced: wherever one goes, they are praised to no end is the new form of pop star or criticism killer who would make us ashamed to listen to this artist's true ... then that mika is reminiscent of many other artists (elton john, bowie, mercury .... that's heavy, the general (the incomparable ?)), and one can surely see a lack of originality in the background. but it is also true that this young man (23 years!) is packed with talent and has an incredible charisma, that make his songs bear the "mark" mika. so i think it should not be judged too quickly - and listen to the cd! undeterred by critics upset (which is somewhat ironic to write a review ...)
