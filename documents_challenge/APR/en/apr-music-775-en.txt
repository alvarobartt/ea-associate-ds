medina offers us an album is conscious in the same lineage as jihad and september 11 with lyrics and punchlines still as explosive and claimant. on the other hand, it is beautifully orchestrated by a very inspired proof using classical sounds very much sticking to the mood of the album. as medina said, this album is not directed at only one part of the population . in fact, all communities are involved and are brought to rethink their prejudices as well as part of their history too often forgotten. minor favorite for the title child of destiny (kunta kinte) who recounts the story of a young african captured colond by white slave and becoming subsequently staged by an effective writing and instrumental that we are viewing this story as my scenario of a film. the title featuring nneka entitled with the shadow of the male is a hymn women but also a denunciation of false assumptions about the treatment of muslim women. in short, for me it is the most successful album.
