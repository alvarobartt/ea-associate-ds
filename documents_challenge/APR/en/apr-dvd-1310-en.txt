after the two masterpieces of tim burton, joel schumacher gives us a batman catastrophic. while the cold and dark world of batman was transformed into a real circus barnum full of colors you get stung eyes and light to make a blind seer. the scenario is a disaster, the actors are hardly convincing and the costumes are laughable. by trying to attract children, they used a film without any quality, and disappoint the fans. a fly like the plague.
