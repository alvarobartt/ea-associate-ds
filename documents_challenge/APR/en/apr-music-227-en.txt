muse returned after exhausting style rock'n'roll and melodic to brutal desires. with black holes and revelations three english out just in time for their style for us here a pot pourri of references branded electronics of the 21st century . this album is resolutely electronic muse, but gives us a tribute to british pop and new wave 80s (the beginning of the album very marked), the slows of elvis presley (of 'soldier's poem' and 'hoodoo '), some passages are punctuated enerv√©s an album relatively calm. the entire course is marked by the voice of matthew bellamy and the bouncing bass chris. a fun album, but conveys less passion than the previous three.
