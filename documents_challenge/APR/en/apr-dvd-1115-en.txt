but c `l` is story that suffers most from the avalanche `d` special effects. the first half-hour film is exciting, for it is with the discovery of a wonderful world. then the monotony `s hints in the film` s totally overrun in the last half hour. in the picture of incredible bonus dvd, harry potter `n` is that a feature film visual, nothing more. very disappointing.
