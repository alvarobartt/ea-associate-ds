if it is one of the best electro album of the year, as saying that 2002 is not a good vintage. album on all nice and well produced. with a tube, however the song no. 2, which can certainly be the song in 2002 in electronics. but it's just too much for an album because the album might be good, but it is not enough variety of stroke was the impression that there are 2 songs on the tube and the rest. this is not the opinion of a passion for electro, which then prevent the fans of this music difficult to appreciate this album, i think that concern rather listen to a few without any particular niche.
