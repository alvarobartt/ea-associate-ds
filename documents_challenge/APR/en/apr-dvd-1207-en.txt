a good starting point, presents an aesthetic, a good cast, the ingredients were there, only now, the bunch of stupid in the world of darkness is to die laughing, i do not know it was an adaptation of a game, good, whatever, see less would have brought more excitement, interest .. in short, you will understood the trouble that gave me this movie, shame, shame, title i liked, too bad, i will board the "skeleton key" or even "the descent"
