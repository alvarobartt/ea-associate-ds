i had the opportunity and the chance to not only read the book but also to test the therapy in question. the book itself seems very well written in clear language, even if this is ammusant, over and through "life lessons" he explains, once again he can not help to the therapist. i especially liked the beginning and the end where he shows his life and his quest for spirituality. as for the big question is whether the presentation he made in his book of his therapy is consistent with the reality of his cabinet, i think we can say that yes as a whole. i found in his book many of the ideas it conveys and the techniques used in therapy. i just put some caveats, namely that this therapy is not necessarily a brief therapy, i know from experience. some patients are progressing greatly and can certainly get away with very cheap with few months of therapy, but not the majority. and i would testify that, if you do not get results fairly quickly, there is the risk (because it works emotionally) to become addicted to therapy and stagnate for years. there was even harder to get that stephen is really charismatic, more than can suggest his book. and he and his acolytes (not bad either) are so convinced and therefore convincing, and are living examples of what they teach, that one wants to believe and cling, although sometimes he would stop and try something else. well then of course i mean me, but not only ... so in summary, it can really pay off to try it, especially in times of crisis, but once you're there, remember it is not that this therapy can work, because i think it no is not appropriate for all and not at any time. it's still a therapy that can certainly be very effective but also very difficult. i could talk about it for hours then stop. at each show.
