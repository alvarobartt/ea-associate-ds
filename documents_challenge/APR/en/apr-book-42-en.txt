as the author says in her acknowledgments, she did correct some passages of his book by a scientist. is that why the novel has more history? forty characters that occur too infrequently, two magical cures, three rides in love ... otherwise many stories and entire paragraphs copied from ancient tomes ... however, for technical and recovery, this book will be much higher, perhaps too much. in short, if i was a very big fan of precedents, i am very bored here. the compromise between science and fiction is not the same as before, this should shook the audience.
