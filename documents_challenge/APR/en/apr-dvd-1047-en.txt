me, i went with leaden feet, like, spielberg blockbuster + made in u.s. + effects + specious promo ...= clumsy trap dollars. well, yahoo, no ... (no, stay on this site) i was amazed. this is a true visionary sci-fi movie, ie that gives you an image not too crazy and therefore credible, and thus disturbing our future possible. bloody well tied up, breathless, relentless scenario and go there i get excited but you can always hold on to the armrests to guess the result, full of really original ideas, visual as in the scenario .... and not stuck at matrix or other makers. no, really, little tom cruise was not misled and i am sure that the plot is so strong that it would have gone well skins hig tech 3d film made in 2003.
