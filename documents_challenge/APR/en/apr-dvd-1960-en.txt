i waited impatiently for this dvd, i was initially very disappointed by the fact that a home cinema system (all zones), dvd hangs from the menu ... it impossible to access content from tv ... i tried it on a computer, this time it works but its content is really low .... the "coach" has no charisma, he does not end his brief explanation ... it smells really amateur .... damage.
