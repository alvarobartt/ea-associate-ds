hands up! i raised my hands to heaven ... and i am put on the ears. big fan of sepultura for quite many years, i remained skeptical about the post-including max and soulfly, since the 90s. i got myself in any case the whole album because i absolutely wanted to see what give the reunion, i put in the plate, and i listened. once, twice, and again and again. but finally, i pass my turn. back to the roots: it has a very good close to its thrash 80s (!!!), with some welcome effects of guitars and a few breaks and bearings igor i ' would have liked to hear a little more. sometimes, when the titles are downright heavy hours of the best megadeth, metallica or testament. it is far from soulfly, anyway. the album is played flat out, but i find it very original. all the songs follow the same pattern. difficult to retain a title, although i like "the doom of all fires", sung to the melody of the well-named "the roof is on fire" or the passage calm and hovering over "bloodbrawl" and if i admits a weakness for "hearts of darkness" ... but that's all! we still feel the heavy potato and technical mastery of the four men, including a little frenchie of gojira. special mention to igor, just as impressive. so why am i so harsh? because of max. he sings the same way for over 20 years, and today it makes me tired. i am from the beginning, but there is too much. smother the solis of scrapes with his big voice, i likes most. i'm sorry, i am curious, but not. i probably go out from time to time. fans will appreciate without any doubt, it is familiar ground, and few risks are taken. but i d√©carcasse for not much. i'm disappointed now.
