well mark ... what happened to you .. it's age ...? okay you're still the god of the scratches and the solo, but why should we let our hungry .....? in "hill farmer's blues", one feels that it will start ... but nothing .... grrr! too bad! this is the age you think? when you have potential and expertise like yours, is not stingy, they met the gum! and then you see you're being fired gentleman farmer .... there are songs that feel frankly straw ... it's true that things are going well with your voice but i'd prefer more "electric" is not the time to walk on the flat-strip calvin russell! fortunately there are some gems like the last piece of the disc (as always ..!), devil's baby and ragpicker's dream. go go, marco, you're still the best and we will still see you in concert next year .... but did you have an interest in fishing and revise your solos!
