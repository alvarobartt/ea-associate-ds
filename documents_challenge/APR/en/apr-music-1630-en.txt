as some reviews have noted it is rather a pity to find only the 1st and last title in the album, thomas newman, which are ultimately the only 2 worthy of interest. when has an album exclusively dedicated to the artist with the 1st song from the album "american beauty" in long version ?.... .... to answer my own question on this disc, there are many one seconds bo film .... antierement the piano! must seek the cover which uses antierement red rose with the woman lying at full length in the flowers .... and you have 'good ".... version so i bought 2!
