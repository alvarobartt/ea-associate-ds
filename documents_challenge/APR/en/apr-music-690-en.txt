this is an excellent album dream theater. it is not less than the previous good, it is different. sent well here on the influence of pink floyd on the members of the group, in fact some pieces are echoes to my memories of "dark side of the moon". derek sherinian on keyboards is very good but less than subtle kevin moore was on previous albums. summarize in an excellent album that you can buy the eyes closed
