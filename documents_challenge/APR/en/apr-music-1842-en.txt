this album is very much on top of all that may be present in male rnb. while there are talents that i like men (maxwell, babyface, jodeci, montell, h. brown ...) no one competes with r. kelly, both songwriter and producer. when asked the new generation of artists rnb mention their recent influences, they cite all r. kelly (as craig david). tp-2.com is thought to play 12 legendary album is certainly the most beautiful production of r. kelly for a long time. after a double lp impersonal and noisy featurings of hip hop, r. kelly gives us a true solo album pure, 100% rnb, hip hop 0%, 0% featurings, 100% r. kelly. fans of the first hour and connoisseurs appreciate the hip hop fans will prefer the previous album. i especially like 'strip 4 u' 'the greatest sex' 'i do not mean it' 'do you say no' 'like a real freak' ... everything is good from a to z.
