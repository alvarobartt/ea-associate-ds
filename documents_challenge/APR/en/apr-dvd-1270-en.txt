is the only movie that makes me want to see again if not daily and verssion dvd allows me to keep in very good condition without damaging because it is un excellent film that connects dance, love, laughter, tears, joy, pain and most important pardon.pour the end there is a very good lesson for young people and adults do not judge by appearance.
