the other day junior (1 months) was really angry and ears of mom and dad put to the test. fortunately i had (in all modesty) excellent idea to slide this cake in the drive and oh wonderful! from the intro to enter sandman, although the hair still a bit short and flimsy neck is a headbanging erratically that junior gave himself a grimace delighted at the corner of lips, then came the intro of nothing else matters and junior burst into tears and howls of disapproval ... decidedly he is really that small, it has already included! vivement le prochain concert we try the diving course as a kangaroo:)
