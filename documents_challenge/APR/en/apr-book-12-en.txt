i devoured and loved the shadow of the wind (yes, you can eat and hate a book, the da vinci code example). i read fast enough "to play the angel," but i not loved. the fact that the story is older than the shadow of the wind is not particularly troublesome. but it loses all reference to the franco era ... we find the supernatural in "playing the angel", while in the shadow of the wind, there is none, which is its strength: a story "extraordinary" without needing "spins" fantasies. not much to say in writing, if it is sometimes confusing passages, and others which do nothing to the story. i recognize that it is absurd to compare 2 novels, but there are so many similarities between the "wind shadow" and "playing the angel", we can not do otherwise impossible love, a rich family , police very wicked wicked, nice very nice booksellers, writer really unfortunate ... etc. in short, disappointed with this novel. not exactly unpleasant, but not nearly as "strong" as the previous one. i recommend the "wind shadow", i advise against "playing the angel"
