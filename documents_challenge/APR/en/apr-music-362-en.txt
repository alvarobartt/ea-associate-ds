linkin park is back with a live and claimed his title by bringing a revolution. the purpose of a concert is to thrill the audience and truly meet his public. arrived with more than one album to a dvd is already making amends and have material to submit. i, who was a fan of the first hour (i've discovered in england a year before it happens in france), i am also spectator of a group that has never changed. from rapcore, the group has only declined to mere rock fm ... the compositions do not earn anything live: linkin replay exactly all the crooked loan. level of guitar and drums has not changed and the rapper who did not already a terrible flow feels compelled to play the orchestra playing the poor sometimes guitar, sometimes the bontempi. the revolution is the tries. the group even insult the intelligence of the audience by playing 2 times the same song (numb + and the version with jayz) then only one version would have sufficed. it's a shame that chester beddington (which was the basis been recruited casting) lost time with a group such as its voice to a real potential.
