the previous album (hi) was not already great but there was at least one or two songs that floated. here is the shipwreck. i do not know exactly what you could expect from the collaboration sardou / fugain but the result is necessarily hopeless. besides "the song is" all songs are meaningless, "french" with its refrain completely missed, "corsica" which will perhaps please the corsican but not music lovers, for "the battle" is not austerlitz, waterloo or alesia is, it depends ... i could go on and worst (the remake of "i would not have time" hardly conceals the failure of inspiration). i do not know if the talent is still there, but obviously the motivation, she is gone (an impression reinforced by the speedy tour following the album). we are disappointed michel. we forget this album (it's pretty easy) and we will listen to old songs.
