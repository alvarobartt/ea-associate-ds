this book is in my opinion very comprehensive. it is very rare that explains how to plant extracts and this book describes very well. moreover, all the explanations about the collection of plants that must be made consistent with the lunar cycle we do understand many details never explained before, including when picking roots, underground part, and the rest of the plant above ground .
