difficult to access, eras intermingle to the point of not knowing where you are in the chronology of an autobiography. a more rigorous timeline would have allowed to soak up the building in time for thought author. this book left me désemparé.de more psychoanalytic approach is not always readily accessible to a lay person, so the mixing autobiography and psychoanalysis is very confusing that difficult to grasp.
