with this album the band has really gained in popularity. this disc was released in 1985 contains of course the tube must "love like blood"! besides this piece, the suite is totally excellent. the famous "eighties" scored a lot of people ... the guitar riffs of this title were copied by the band nirvana for a hit ... jaz killing joke attacked in lawsuits. that's the story ... i love the title "darkness before dawn" ... always these guitars, the bass rumbles, the heavy drum beat and powerful. the sound quality is excellent. jaz's voice has been chastened compared to previous albums. killing joke tackles the fans of rock, or depeche mode the cure. this new trend will be confirmed on the next album "brighter than a thousantd suns. otherwise, no other big hits on the "night time" the whole is homogeneous and listen at once. with the cd format is becoming more demanding and unfortunately there are no bonus tracks. 40 minutes of music, but a very good time to go.
