sin city is a visual marvel, pushing the boundaries of originality. the atmosphere perfectly restored comics, technical performance, the screenplay, music, staging and actors, with a parade of incredibly charismatic all stars! exciting end to end, violent and full of surprises, the film is the epitome of perfection. the edition dvd is high quality, it would perhaps have hoped for more extensive bonus, but do not spoil our fun! i would, however, two caveats. the first concerns the presence of a vf dts on simple editing and a vo dts on the collector. this choice is questionable and bizarre. purists prefer the original version, of course ... and others? and why change from one edition to another? the second is the recurring theme of the long version: it has been proposed. obviously, this is not the case ... the fans will (still) out their wallet!
