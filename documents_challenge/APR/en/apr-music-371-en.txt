without doubt, then, are there any purist to find fault with this album, and perhaps will is right. whatever. i am not a connoisseur of opera, but i was transported with delight in listening to this album that resembles nothing of what i thought. the melodies are soft and warm, haunting, luminous. it looks like a starry sky in summer. fun, just fun.
