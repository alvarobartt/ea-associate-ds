the 4 stars are the "average" from: -5 stars for the content always so sumptuous, the vink pure, and interviews with the author at the end of the book. the person to whom i offered - a fan 'of the mad monk - loved it. -0 star for the format: what a disappointment to the receipt when i saw it was a size "manga" small soft-cover format! and i expect the same format as for the 2 full of mad monk, i was very disappointed.
