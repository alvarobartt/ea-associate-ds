my mother gave me a copy of this book when i was a child. my nine year old daughter, rummaging through a box of books that i kept from my childhood, discovered the book: it does it is more separated from. his fascination was indeed so great that it is absolutely required to find "white mane" to his classmates during a presentation. the magic of this book, taken from a film made in 1953, has again made: the vast majority of children (especially girls!) was seized by the romantic story (a young boy tries to tame a horse, leader of a herd of wild horses) and the stunning beauty of photographs. a classic that proves that the stories or articles "high tech" are not only able to dream kids!
