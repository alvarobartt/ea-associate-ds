it is a bawdy book from beginning to end. with some sexual liberation (heterosexual but also development of tolerance vis-Ã -vis homosexuality). an early love story between zelda and scott, who quickly turns into a nightmare with the appearance of an airman. the relationship between zelda and patricia (her daughter) is a sadness for me it just missed her life than to miss her daughter. motherhood is deplorable and does not want. it does not attach to the characters. zelda is pathetic and she has convictions that are not feminine. his love for scott is embarrassing. both characters are broken and are not at all happy. it is a book that is a sadness as history: zelda finished only because it made no concession, it is pretty selfish with his entourage. i did not like this book, which shows no positive side of life (even maternity) and i would say that this book does not deserve a prize.
