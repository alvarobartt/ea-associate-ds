a man died in circumstances rather mundane, the inspector who are overweight and at risk of infarction from the steps of the investigation, resolves passed through the victim and a jackhammer. and then, finally, it was not for angina pectoris. whew! polar quite commonplace. the plot ahead with the grace of the jackhammer in question. we do not believe for a second, no character is sympathetic stories annexes (relations with the daughter of the inspector) are flat. the outcome is not very interesting. it seems that the author tries to imitate the style of henning mankell. but without the talent. in summary: i do not advise it.
