it is true that this is an album of 71 ... sheila sings beautifully (with a lot of support and treble in his voice) and the orchestrations are very neat, licked (jean claude petit for some ). certe an album for the fans but an album that was not so bad that it is aging and could create surprises (seventies revival!). my favorites: "fragile", "white, yellow, red, black," "woman" ... good listening
