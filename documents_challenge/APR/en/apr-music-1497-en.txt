juelz santana on cam'ron compere we released a very good album in emsemble well as on the tradition of shows do as his beats on almost every album released by roc-a-fella are the instrumentals or sampled the music of soul for years 60-70. the flow of juelz passes very well, but the lyrics do not vary much. only to love this album you have to like what the diplomats.
