fan of muse of the first hour, i approached this album the same way as all the others i gave myself several plays to fully appreciate. i listened several times. and after that several more times. and there ... well not much. replicas of pieces of previous albums (stockholm syndrome, megalomania ...), which, like any reply, are worse than the originals. pieces frankly unpleasant to the ear (supermassive black hole. ..). attempts unfinished electronica (departing air "take a bow" and landing in disaster). in short, 2 pieces 1 / 2 interesting: the first half of "take a bow", "map of the problem" (which reminds butterflies &amp; hurricanes), and "knights of cydonia" (the original). for the rest, we are dealing with an album certainly "different" but "worse" than any other. especially to my taste, matthew bellamy drowned his voice behind effects rarements successful when it does not simply botched his vocal performance.
