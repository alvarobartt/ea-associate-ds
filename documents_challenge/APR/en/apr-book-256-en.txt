not the best book by valerie cupillard. although intended to deal with grains and legumes, grains are dominating (2 / 3 pound) while the part on the pulse is thin. the recipes presented are generally simple and lacking a little creativity. in addition, the layout and editing quality are average (a few pictures, thick paper). other books by the same author and from the same publisher, are far more interesting and enjoyable to leaf through the seasons and desires.
