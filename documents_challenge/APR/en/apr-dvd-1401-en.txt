the film is constructed as a series of paintings, posters, or rather more or less flashy. the boredom grabs you quickly and despite the posturing of val kilmer, fails to leave you. the russians are cold. they manifest. and you see no mist escaping from their mouths! ah, those pesky russians are well aware it take to outwit mother nature. probably vodka should it allow the steam to disappear by cold! all anti-american cliches russia are present in this film. of course the nice americans are stronger than the evil russians. this is probably what one might call a happy ending. a dreadful movie.
