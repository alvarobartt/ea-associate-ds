humanity, humility, energy, rock and social struggle, the founding pillars of the english punk ideology since 1976 we are reviving and experience what those years were chaotic but warm through interviews full of emotions and images of shocks what were the clash, the best rock band in history, with rebels breaks and causes. the sudden death of the charismatic leader joe strummer bury me for 15 years with the clash. this commando rock we had crossed our best years and we are still reversible. they had everything. what a mess and thank you! the clash will run again in my music box for the next 15 years. take it or leave it!
