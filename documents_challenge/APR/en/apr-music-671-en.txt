a new album by renaud garcia fons is still a small event, a promise of enchantment. the only exception to this rule, we find the touch, the subtlety of your playing, there are compositions and refreshing summer that transport us into another universe. only drawback, for my case is the presence of the singer, probably excellent, but when i bite into. in conclusion, an album to own and enjoy.
