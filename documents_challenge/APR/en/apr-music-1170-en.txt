while it is true that nirvana has subsequently been widely copied, and it feels to hear something 1000 times heard elsewhere. but even trying to put out this disc in the context of that time, i still have trouble finding it made for it. the remarkable drummer does not make the unbearable voice of kurt cobain and compositions without any inspiration. kurt was a fan of the pixies and sonic youth, he has the good sense to do something different. unfortunately it is very far from the level of his idols. i definitely hard with the rock of 90s (though i'm young).
