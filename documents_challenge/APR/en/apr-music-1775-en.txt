the success of this "artist" is a great mystery ... no voice, text distressing, music of absolute flatness. coluche as saying "when you think that people would not buy it so that it would be selling more" ... on his site you can download music for these songs as ringing phones and the fact is that ca sonne tres ringtone phone .. and not a compliment! the decor and the technical means are there to hide the poverty of music and text, + voice on this show is completely inaudible, as has its image sulfur, it is not very interesting but probably very marketing .. then exit the beaten path, there are so many real talented french artists galerent to discover in small rooms or on cd ...
