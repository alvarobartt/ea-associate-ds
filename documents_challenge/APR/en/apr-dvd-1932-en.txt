film that has unfortunately grown old. the characters no longer exist today and the subject seems far from us. fran√ßoise rosay is very theatrical. i recommend instead "funny drama" and "extenuating circumstances" if the brave dvd publishers bothered to reissue classics of french cinema rather than their contemporaries turnips and imported.
