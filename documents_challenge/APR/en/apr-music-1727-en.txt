in the 1980s, when i lived in london, i got early tickets to `les miserables', playing at the barbican theater in london for its london premiere. had i actually ticket for midweek after the weekend opening - as anyone who has seen the production knows, it has a very complicated set structure with a barricade that folds up and down. as luck would have it (for me, in any case), this complicated apparatus had mechanical difficulties the first several nights, forcing them to keep the show closed until (drum roll, please) the night i had tickets.
