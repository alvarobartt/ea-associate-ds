the writing is superb, vocabulary and sustained attacks, the surprising narrative. orhan pamuk is the nobel prize in literature for nothing. he knows how to wield the pen and it shows. the use of a "protean narrator" turns the investigation into a puzzle whose image is revealed to us only as and to the chapters which follow. against a background of confrontation between east and miniature venetian painting is the resistance of the east against the west that is emerging. packed with all these qualities and this novel would have been exceptional but it is finally revealed disappointing and boring . seven hundred pages of digression wet have failed due to having my patience. a discharge of the author, i do not think enough nor sufficiently educated connoisseur of the art of miniature turkish taste for having their fair values at the many artistic references that dot my name is red. however, the author ought not to give us a gallery of characters so caricatured and having so shallow. in short, i do not deny the literary qualities of this novel of orhan pamuk, but i'm really annoyed by reading my name is red.
