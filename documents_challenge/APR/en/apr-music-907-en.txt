here is a compilation succeeds for mop. there are several good songs but also some very good as the excellent cold as ice. but he must love the band's style is quite aggressive. except that we can add more if only they will find their greatest morceux with guests such as jay z or funk master flex. in short this a good album that i board primarily to fans of mop.
