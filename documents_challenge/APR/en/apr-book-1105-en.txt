there may be some interesting mechanisms in what is called apoptosis, but it is quite wrong to consider that they provide keys to understanding life and illusion to believe they will find medical responses. a more current and more realistic (because they do not implement any of these mechanisms transphysique or transchimique who always flora in the history of biology) is to consider a multicellular organism as a single ecosystem that seen passing through permanent changes in equilibrium (and this according to the theory of evolution). the cells die because they no longer find where they are placed, depending on their environment and their constitution, adequate resources for their survival. i go into the forest and i am always amazed at the great organization that 'there are: large trees with strong trunks and lofty peaks, moss and small plants with dark feet, leaping deer and badgers, insects rummaging the ground ... and there's nothing like a forest that another forest in the same region (a few different "individual" anyway ... but a remarkable repetition of a "model" forest). when the forest initially implanted, there is initially many small plants hungry for light, small rodents ... who die and whose population disappears when the forest develops. it does not come to me the idea that there is a genetic code of a "forest species" that ensures the orderly development by implementing its various components and, again, would the information from a "chemical signal" sent to the first generation of plants, plant themselves on a mechanism to respond to this signal and that would then die in a manner entirely is altruistic for the good development of the forest ... the cells between the fingers as die during embryonic development, the successive equilibria are there are very few blood vessels that develop: they die of starvation and poisoned by their waste!
