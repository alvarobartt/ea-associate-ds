ooh la, what a disappointment that this first album from hoobastank. with the exception of the highly successful up &amp; gone, the album is a collection of titles certainly effective, but no flavor. it looks like lots of things already heard and mostly sub-incubus. despite several plays, one can never remember the names of the tracks so they differ slightly from each other (again with the exception of up &amp; gone). to listen in the background while doing something else, it does not deserve better.
