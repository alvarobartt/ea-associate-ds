so here it is, the latest james bond. both "casino royale" () was a good issue here ... as daniel craig bond remains a strong and credible. most players are faring with the honors even amalric. but then, what's wrong? in short, realization. too fast, too choppy, too choppy, too sudden, too nervous, too tense. it loses all: understanding of scenes, whose sequence is often confused, and history in general, acting, and it shows vaguely frustrated. the director, marc forster, probably wanted away from the traditional bond turning to the trilogy "jason bourne" (), among others, but this is bond is bond, and if it tolerates few changes, is the bond we want, and nothing else. well, anyway ... it still looks forward to the next.
