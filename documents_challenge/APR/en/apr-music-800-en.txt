i did not buy the first version of the album "taller in more ways" but where is the new voice of amelle barrabah (the sugababes) on some songs. in any case, this version is successful and welcome to it. otherwise, amelle appears in "gotta be you," "follow me home", "red dress" and "now you're gone" and the rest is with mutya buena (ex-sugababes). the sugababes interpret walks sexy or grow up to be as "follow me home" or "now you're gone". the electro-pop songs like "push the button" or "red dress". rnb songs like "gotta be you". if my shots are hearts for "ugly" and "ace reject". however, i do not much "joy division".
