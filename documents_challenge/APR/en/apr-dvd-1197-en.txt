andy garcia, cuban émigré, talks about his country, that country where he can not return. it is a film ultimately apolitical because i think there is clear excesses of the dictator batista before the revolution and the excesses of this revolution (see especially the scene on the saxophonoe) with a cold and clear vision of che guevara represented as the very opposite of a liberator. you can report any cameos by dustin hoffman in new york mafia trying to settle in havana showing one of the many ills of the era of batista. maybe this role is deleted too but it has already been developed in other films like the godfather ii. the other is the cameo by bill murray with a role a bit indescribable as it acts as a "stand up comedian" but ultimately never go on stage. perhaps playing he role of an american spy, but nothing is certain ... but what is most important in this film it is the family dimension of this tragedy as this wealthy family is torn by revolution. it is a poignant picture of what that had to live for many cuban families. finally, what makes the great charm of this film are the decor of havana have been restored so brilliant as the film was shot in the republic dominicaine.et course music, which provides pervasive desire to hear more. in short, all i can really advise is to see this film, but good ac vo is for all foreign films you do not really regret it.
