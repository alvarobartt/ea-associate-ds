after a great trilogy on serial killers, i was very disappointed by the latest book by mr. chattam. the pace is very slow, the characters somewhat endearing, not to mention that one can easily imagine that not only is the killer in egypt but also the frame between the two history books. really disappointed, but i expected this novel with great anticipation ...
