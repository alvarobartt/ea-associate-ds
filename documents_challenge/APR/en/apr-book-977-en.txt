hello, very disappointed, i explain we are bored to death with this book, no suspence, pages and pages of blah-blah on the moods of scarpetta and benton which was what to do (more half the book) and nothing happens! it moves slightly in the last fifty pages, but barely. i appressa most books cornwell, that it's not all. do not waste your money, it is not worth the trouble jc
