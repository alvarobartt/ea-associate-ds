i wanted to read this book by jules verne and sincerely i did not find the same pleasure in my youth ... perhaps because of this trip too unreal to a point where the main characters encounter prehistoric animals ... finally, let's say you're in fantasy, imagination and swing plein.cependant must place the novel in relation to the time he was writing and ideas of society right now -- there. and there the matter at the end of the book in this collection can reframe the discoveries and preconceptions of the time. like any good novel of extraordinary journeys, jules verne takes us through his classic schematic scriptwriting. and once again, the theme of the volcano is omnipresent and saves our hero ... in conclusion i enjoyed the attached file "keys work" and excerpts from novels on this theme. a multi-page glossary provides definitions of certain words and names that recur in the works of jules verne, great initiative from the publisher.
