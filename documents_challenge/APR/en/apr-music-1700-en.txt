an album very varied and nuanced in which the drummer has assembled a fine team of free improvisers: joe lovano, john scofield, kenny werner, marc johnson and i understand. the tracks are mixed and the gap side of jazz rock (sweet soul) they remind necessarily bass desires, do not pay in parades muscular, quite the contrary, they only highlight the delicate approach standards as original pieces that the group returned lovingly instilling in their hectic lives.
