fan of the previous albums, i must admit that this album is very very bad. it is bored from beginning to end. if the king of shadows floats, other titles (the elixir, delirium, phoebus ...) are boring at first listen. while they sound good, but what a lack of lyrical depth and musical ... it is rare that after 30 seconds we say we have done around the issue, and when the second listening happens, you have a bad impression of repetition. already the first track set the tone: the ill-m, very heavy. m striker finally certain securities in which the elixir from asking a refrain spoken in the middle of the song that i always find horrible. finally, the last special item for "hold-up" which i think is the worst title i could listen. it's bad, a rhythm worthy of first bontempi, and frankly, i struggled to hear the full title once. i wanted to zap every 10 seconds so it's sickening. here, then, very bad to sum up, far from his last studio album.
