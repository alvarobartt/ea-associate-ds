i wandered in here and there on amazon and what do i see? an average score of 3stars for the album that i consider to be the album of the first quarter of the year. like many, i discovered white lies on the english sites there are now a few months and i wanted to hear "the next big thing "across the channel ... so, yes, white lies is inspired by some groups that have the force of british music, but above all a band of three bright young fellows who are capable of delivering tracks both powerful and very melodic . the first two tracks on the album "to lose my life" and the masterful "death" awaken my eardrums encumbered by so many disappointments as industrial rock the years 2007 and 2008 were able to deliver us. the climax of the album for me is the sublime "unfinished business". so, yes, some may criticize the look "unfinished" of certain texts from boys who think that everything is either dead or love, but i note that these same critics will relish the mediocre album from oasis, u2 and indochina, which for once are real turnips. alas the great french disease: cling to groups who have released an excellent album 10 years ago and spit on youth groups that have nothing to envy except slaughter media hallucinating they still enjoy. yes, we can worship the english rock and abhor oasis. give a chance to this group listen to just the three titles mentioned in this article and know that the album is full of other titles also saving for the rock that is "shall", "farewell to the fareground" or "our fifty forehead." because for the suddenly, it is indeed a big difference between the album white lies and the opus of oasis, u2, morrissey and others is that here each track is both singular and very good.
