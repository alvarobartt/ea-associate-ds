obviously with hindsight, the albums with david lee roth show a group full of energy and creativity, not hesitating to mix styles, evidence of great musical opening. obviously, with the arrival of sammy hagar the group has lost the flame of innovation that inspired them to become a more or less a mat as toto. simply, van halen has evolved with the times, malheureusemnt not to my taste, too many synths and musical clich√©s but they had created some years earlier stages. here, everything is academic but the good humor of david lee roth and flew musical brothers van halen will remain forever in our hearts of rockers.
