it was after a long hesitation that i chose this book to teach me to stylesheets. following a first quick reading i thought i would not learn much ... but ultimately it's a challenge to complete my habits that drove me. my last site is really a success that the author should be thanked as well as sites offering free templates css 2. a reference work recommended.
