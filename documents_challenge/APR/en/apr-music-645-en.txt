this is not the blues, all the pieces are constructed the same way and after 2 min they become "pop". johnny sings pretty well, but the titles are not very good. blowgun is much worse than the original. i'am the blues is not outright terrible ... it is not known to the blues in france and you can hear ... listen to johnny winter and you will see what is the blues! the real thing (for experts)
