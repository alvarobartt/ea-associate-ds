there are great novels as good wines. they get better with time and read at different times of life is always an interesting experience. i have read this book six or seven times, each time with a different feeling, and each reading was a discovery. of course, the images are strong and the pages of the novel intense emotions of the hostel ' admiral benbow, billy bones, pew, black mark, the barrel of apples, the attack on the fort, ben gunn, the fighting with israel hands, the skeleton, silver's parrot and the menacing shadow of captain flint. but this fantasy novel which is the matrix of modern fiction adventure, not a book for children. in books for children, morality is indicated "unencrypted" at the end of history. here, nothing, just the recollection of nightmares and the relief of knowing that the murderer long john silver got away with it. in stevenson, the roles are not so clear that the protagonists making learning to mature in the eyes of the reader. the author has used this technique in the excellent interference. the key role is that of young jim hawkins and we can see the change in his personality to the pages. it is endearing and only long john silver is considered as an adult, let us note. the treacherous and changing character of the old pirate is also well made by stevenson and the end the reader does not know if he is honest or not. hard to provide benchmarks for young readers with such a character! i think for imaginary play full, you must read this novel without any visual illustration. not that i go denigrate the qualities of great illustrators of different versions of treasure island, but the best illustrations are those in the head. it is just one illustration: map. in the version i read (editions du rocher), it fails. stevenson was very fond of because it is from this map that he himself realized that grew throughout the romantic plot. to read, reread, to read and yo yo yo and a bottle rum!
