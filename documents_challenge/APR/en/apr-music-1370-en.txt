by offering two albums in less than 6 months, system of a down has become commonplace ... others have made the connection with the musical approach of rammstein, which although an officer in a rather different kind, seems to take a similar direction. after all included in only two albums, both groups will in effect in one year took a direction more accessible (if not commercial), proposed two albums (including a second substantially lower) finally tired already a lot of people . like (too) often the result is not already in the last two pieces of mezmerize, we would anticipate the following. because yes, hypnotize is far less exciting than mezmerize, which still kept the flame after a toxicity almost legendary. yet everything had started well enough with "attack" but as "dreaming", one feels a certain disappointment quickly before "kill rock 'n roll" will dig the nail. and many plays will change nothing, however, not from each listening confirmed this impression. and the guitarist's vocal contribution is more appropriate since this too (it was great when he intervened to contrast with the singer's voice). "attempt" and "holy mountains" are level but overall, we can only deplore a true melodic approach. some titles are ridiculous or even insulting ( "vicinity of obscenity" or "she's like heroin"). on behalf of originality, we must endure pop titles as mediocre? the time when a fan of slayer could listen to soad seems gone with this hypnotize. and if one considers mezmerize / hypnotize as one album, it does not mean he is a total success, with 11 valid bits 22 (8 on the first and 3 on the second disc). in short, an album by a group that we were accustomed to great music, inspired and exciting. big disappointment ...
