film ma-gni-fique! the cover said it had been directed by the creators of "chronicles of narnia" this movie so bland with pitiful hero filled up the good feelings overdose ... (recipe typical of disney movies and their cartoons). nothing to do with this movie! bridge to terabithia so is simply incredible. the end leaves "dreamer" and i long to see more. the most recent film that i liked most
