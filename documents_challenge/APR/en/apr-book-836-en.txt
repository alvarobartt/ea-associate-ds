a book written with a line .... it's fashionable for some time. the reader will find taste when the pace and variety are part of reading .... this is not the case, shame! the idea of the book is interesting, this woman who gradually turns into a pig (hence the title, for those who cares ...). this deserves a new, barely. 300,000 copies sold out for a first novel, hat, mary! i suppose the excitement had found its origin in the pleasure to read is shocking. this is not what the reader research today.
