to go in the direction of the previous comment mine, i must say that the metaverse, imagined 92, resembles a game such as, for example, second life. the term avatar is also used today for representation of a user on the internet. i also found interesting what one can learn about the sumerian civilization, which in general is widely alleging encyclopedias. i expected to fall on a book for teens, but i found a book more in depth!
