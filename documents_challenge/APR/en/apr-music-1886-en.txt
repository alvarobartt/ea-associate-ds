ian matthews electrifies his music and this fishery. very very good group and very good compositions. the voice is magic (charlie chaplin's smile). good idea to have met these 2 cds. stealin'home has been a hit album in great britain (gimme an inch girl from robert palmer ), shake it. personally i prefer ian matthews in the previous period, so much softer folk rock with a lot more at ease with his voice.
