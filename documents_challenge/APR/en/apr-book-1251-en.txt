we discover the thesis of philippe breton as sword hung above the homo communicans. the first two parts of the utopia of communication relating to historical facts are impartial enough to provide freshness in this thesis. however, the arguments made in the last section, greatly based on the technique (providing communication) may prove to be handling more than one would like to admit. the work dates from 1992, we can surely do not classify breton in the visionaries. he wants to show that all prices too much communication kills communication. the problem is perhaps not exactly at that level, but rather in terms of relaying information. this is really impartial or modifies there information to his advantage? if you want to learn the history of communication, i recommend this book, except that for breton's opinion, do you spend at the risk of making leaps, so it is wrong (the history shows) every thing in advance.
