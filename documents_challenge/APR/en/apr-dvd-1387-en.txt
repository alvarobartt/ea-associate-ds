ph. caubère is drastically wrong! it is really pity, and one really wonders how a director can accept such a game. from beginning to end, one wonders if he believes in a comedy? béatrice dalle pity too. all that for that? this role so narrow, so poor, which we may at no time give any credibility? at the same time, it is a very bad actress, so it seems natural that it is found to play such roles. the rest could not be wrong. benoît magimel has charm, and found a little face of de niro, sometimes to the floor below, of course. petit film that reveals itself.
