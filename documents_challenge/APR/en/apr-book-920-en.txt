this novel is not a masterpiece, a rather sloppy writing alternating passages of great action with great passages of thinking a little self-indulgent ... bounce twists, the author leads us into a situation more more surreal when one would like there to be a logical explanation or there is none and one wonders a little if kennedy did not know how to finish his book? the downward spiral in which the hero is driven is rather farfetched and is not found in the claw of the original author in its infancy. on the other hand, i found some passages vulgar free and kennedy we had not used to this ... is it because that his novel is set in paris?
