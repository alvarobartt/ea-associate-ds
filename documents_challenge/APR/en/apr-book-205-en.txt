i prize this book mainly because it was marked "hugo award" at the bottom of the page, and i was right! this book is a novel human, where the characters have their qualities and their defects, and which is easily attached (yes, i even managed to cling to the queen!). a beautiful story about the difference, even a clone can not be completely identical to the original. it was always a choice!
