you never bought the long version of "lord of the rings" because it does not delighted you have to get up in the middle of the film to change discs? indeed, previous editions "long version" is on 2 discs. with this edition you will see on the box before you even open the dvd a beautiful inscription "finally the long version on one disc !"... yes but they have forgotten to specify that it is a double-sided disc and it should still stand in the middle of the film to return! better than that, the dvd includes "long version" + "version cinema "on the same dvd, and you want to watch one or the other versions, you must still return the disk to the middle of the film ... now even the short version and divided into 2 parts! so i put 2 stars, not the film, which is still great, but i'm not going dearer superlative on this magnificent film. i met 2 stars for this edition edition "sting" on which it is not clear that this is a 2 sided dvd ... i wanted to put 1 star because it still makes me ill to have bought the 3 dvds at once hoping to have one "real" dvd, but i think the package is still a very beautiful, then let's be fair play! ;)
