two possibilities: - either you are allergic to vivaldi and you hate instruments called "original". assume your perversions and buy this disc. - either you're not a music lover and you've heard of this character that is publicized on the dashing and evil nigel dressed up: in this case does not fall into the trap. this disc is both a horror and an error. kennedy did not shove vivaldi: he brutally disfigured. go towards the carmognola violinist who has recorded twice this season: an interpretation "punchy", virile, committed and stylistically appropriate. the chic and the music front toc, inspired by the tightrope walker facing the bull in a china shop. this is not a disk but a sack, an act of vandalism. what is the police?
