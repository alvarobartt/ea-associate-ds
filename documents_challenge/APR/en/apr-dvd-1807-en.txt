the wars of stars. a trilogy of legend who scored the must fantastic film. actors marking a script and fantastic images, with no models. so ... episode 1 is no imaginable. no actors, graphics that are not equal to that of jurassic park, and even small plastic models of twenty years ago. only the generic music is great in this movie ... the rest of the money stinks.
