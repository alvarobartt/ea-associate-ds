oh la la! that's bad ac, shrinking from nothing really, i started to listen to this cd, and although the result is worse than what i expected! some were found in calogero first album of something (very) vaguely interesting but in this one they should look away .. music languorous or dripping sauce obispo, texts and tasteless dishes, the short "leg" zazie (see also his " working for willem c. ..). excerpts: apple c: "she writes me but my screen formats feelings" .. it must also format the singers .. funny animal, message: hunting birds that not well, the bomb .. not recycling like the song i am committed to pushing the doors open zazie "i am a man." sorry but it's still the variety of well calibrated pseudo rock trend star ac and pseudo texts tortured intellectuals connected. besides we baton this time the single "the debacle of the feelings" of the duo calogero / stanislaus and one finds the same orchestrations pompous and boring, and if it was rather the debacle of what remains of the french song?
