in any art, some artists offer a new vision, a kind of vibration premonition of the future. the zone 2 is accompanied by an excellent documentary "image by image" on the making of the film and directed by orson welles, who is worth it. you can trust me, i have two editions and it's really day and night. supplements zone 1 are also very interesting (the second disc is devoted entirely).
