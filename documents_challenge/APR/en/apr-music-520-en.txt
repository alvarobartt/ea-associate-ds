why this band and this album in particular is praised by audiences and critics, remains an absolute mystery to my ears! the group in 1000 places of fair play and good and kurt cobain who was not a pleasant voice for a penny and found a way to sing half true throughout this disc (and the entire discography of training, by the way!). nirvana best band in the 90?? i dream! just a garage band, which would have done better to remain confined at home! avoid like the plague, who likes rock melodic and intelligent.
