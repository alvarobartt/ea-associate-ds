(with great inventiveness in the use of instruments, and lhasa in its voice, hoarse and strange ...) i always replay the "llorona" with great pleasure he has not aged in ten years! i loved, but just under his second opus: "the living road", about which she had told telerama: "la llorona is not me, this character has allowed me to release my anger, my passion, the volcano that i want my way i m√®re.cette closed now. in the studio, i tried to come back, it was exhausting. to be fair, i should be more internal, less theatrical; do pass energy through the gentle ... "i deeply regret this change since his first album was great! the latest cd is catchy, haunting, heavy and dark. lhasa takes the leitmotif of his previous record with a sometimes cumbersome (see: "love came here"). the only title that is not a semblance of remake is "fool's gold", a song-prone country-folk. * i totally agree with the remarks of the internet "sulmont domitilla" too disappointed (see his comment above) and did not like me "hooked". jeanlouis 29
