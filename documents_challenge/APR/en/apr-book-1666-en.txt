better to borrow this book from the library instead of buying it. the book is a good introduction to the creation of wealth, the only thing i can draw really, is that it's not our job everyday that we make rich. the author discusses other ways: real estate, investment, stock market ... but i found the book very light and i have not hung style. it can change its view on money, that's a good point but do not think there aie a recipe in this book . i find that many items were not addressed. the author could have gone further. in short, i say "not bad but bof!"
