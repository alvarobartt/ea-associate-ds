i find it appalling that the editor in zone 2 have had the nerve to make these 2 dvd in packaging tape to the eye, plexi and metal enclosures, but was not able to edit in 5.1, while version original is 5.1. i was ready to buy these two dvds, but when i read that they offered the view audio, i was really disgusted. it is useless to invest in equipment "home cinema" for the equivalent of several hundred usd and find today as mediocre products.
