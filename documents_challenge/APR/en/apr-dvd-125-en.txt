qule pleasure to finally see this masterpiece on dvd! the colors have been reworked, the menus are animated, and in total agreement with the film! the only black point of this edition is the absence of the original voices! what a pity for the old not find the songs so well known ... the new voices are fairly close to old, but do not arrive at the ankle ... the dvd is still to be mainly for its bonus!
