we hear everywhere that the rolling stones is very above its predecessors (voodoo lounge and bridges to babylon), and many who say this are pure conservateurs.au least those albums the band jagger trying to evolve, integrating sounds nouveaux.l√† not an ounce of originality that's real rolling stones 80s trend does not look any tube on this album no piece stands out from the rest, however we seem to hear the same morceaux.alors there may have been some efforts in the texts but musically there is a real failure of inspiration.
