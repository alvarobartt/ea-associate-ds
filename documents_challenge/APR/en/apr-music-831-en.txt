it is likely that opinions are very divided on where björk, we can only love it or hate it. but it is undeniable that it is certainly one of the strongest personalities in the existing music for several years. so it greatly disturbs or she fascinates. in my case, it clearly fascinates me, and at several levels. first restranscrire its ability to perfectly tie that binds to iceland, as folklore, legends, and especially the mysterious nature empowered are recurring themes in both his attitude and his music. the domination of nature over man inspires fear, power, respect ... and texture of most of its steep compositions ( "i'm a whisper in water, i'm a tree that grows hearts', sings it in" bachelorette "). then comes the strange dualism between that heritage and its modern electronic inflections characteristic of the tormented world of bjork, who captivates me. the merger of the cold and tribal electronica (including five years or pluto) and the warmth of beautiful arrangements of classical strings gives a result of contrasts extremely original and ingenious, and emblematic of icelandic landscapes: steep, difficult to master, and glacial hot, short, breathtaking. finally, the voice, percussive musical element in björk, which is disconcerting personality: there sees some form of madness (his way of singing his colorful collection of human relationships the accents paranoid), a quality that always fascinates me as a woman in the field of art. and why "homogenic" more than "start" or "post"? undoubtedly because in my eyes, homogenic contains his best compositions, particularly inspired, and has an i-don't-know-what of homogeneous, precisely: the mix between electronica and string orchestra is sublimated here.
