here's one of the most beautiful interpretation ('ll also see the side home hilary hahn) of this masterpiece missed bach and the violin. perfect technical mastery of course, but especially true ownership of this great classical piece. the style kremer, quick and precise, no unnecessary frills, almost crude, is wonderful here: the artist with a passion for bach (pun?) and it shows. in a word: need. note that the soundtrack "playing the violin" includes an excerpt of this recording.
