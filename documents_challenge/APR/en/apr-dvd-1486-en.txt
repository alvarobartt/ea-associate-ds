saw this movie as a student, i kept a pretty crazy memories of this film. time passes, each means of entertainment is bievenue. alas, the film contains references to other films of this period, which have usually not past years. the gags fall flat, the situations become more pathetic than anything else. there are a few moments to improve overall, but nothing more. i was glad to get to the end of the film.
