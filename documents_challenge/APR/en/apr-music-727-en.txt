i almost put 5 stars on this latest cd soad, but i find it a little short for my liking (36 minutes and 11 seconds) ... bahhh, motes i just, true, but my taste is the only downside of this mezmerize. at the musical level, we find soad in good shape and still be as crazy, transitions between passages punk, thrash metal and are always well under control (although sometimes predictable). the flow of serj is hallucinating and hope to see even stronger by daron sings more on this cd. moreover, it is a highlight of this cd, the 2 voices seem almost complementary to each other. for me, the 11 tracks on this cd worthwhile, even if some may seem somewhat confusing at the 1st listen. a very good album that makes you want to find out later that just before the end of the year ....
