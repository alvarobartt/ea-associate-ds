i have no comment to make on this dvd because it was impossible to watch: 1 - they asked me for area code + "error". i do not know what this means and your delivery does not explain anything or even the purchase agreement to start. 2 - subtitling is in spanish, or french ... i am! it's true it's written on the dvd itself, but it is not clear at time of order ... please help me to understand all of ca and give me a solution if there is one. bonne annee quand meme!
