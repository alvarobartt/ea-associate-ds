i found this film full of good intentions at the base. i'd say it's rather a movie to watch with children of muslim culture and this is probably the problem. alas, this tunisian film is full of cliches and the long strings of the script and the acting (especially the girl that i find quite unpleasant), frankly become heavy. one passage deserves attention in my opinion. a digression on the misadventures of a fantasy hero side. we regret not more.
