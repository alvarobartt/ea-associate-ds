i found this character by reading books on the subject of the great war but who sometimes refers to the first nurse in history who went on a battlefield (crimean war). the slightly fictionalized story that we book the author is remarkable. this literary form (the fictionalized story) can transform a subject that could be daunting as a biography in an entertaining reading. i learned with astonishment in his book that miss florence nightingale was a bipolar person (two persons who coexist in the same body) and in aspects of total philanthropy hiding sometimes extreme selfishness. thus the same for a multitude of feelings, such as: kindness, wickedness, wisdom-delusion, overflowing activity-total prostration, etc.. but this exceptional woman has invented and promoted a job (before it reserved for women drunks, prostitutes) , introduced the recognition of the value of the work of a nurse by the caste of doctors, established schools of nursing, established rules of medical procedures (aseptic, ...), etc.. . conclusion: a very good book about an exceptional woman.
