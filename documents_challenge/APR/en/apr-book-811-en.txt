no woman, however, is the country, government, religion does not deserve such a traitements.et my opinion, the subject of this book is not about the evils of communist china on women. to me he contemplates the folly of men has greater range. what these chinese women have suffered, millions of women have suffered it before and after thousands of them in other cultures, at other times. this book has just recalled that history repeats itself endlessly to the detriment of women and children (among other things), a fact that i find deeply unacceptable level!
