perhaps by reading this book at night and a snowstorm, i would have found more engaging. unfortunately stephen king takes us out here a complete history and telephoned boat, a story of a werewolf who leaves nothing to the ordinary: a small town in new england lost a few characters, some will die in horrific conditions, and one is the culprit. so the mystery planner, but on some pages, not more. and coincidentally, the boy hero is a cripple. it's strange that film has been done ... by cons, not surprising that the book does that 80 pages: stephen king understood that it was better not to sink into a story without interest. little originality, in my version at least, history has followed the script of the film. i did not even read but it will amuse you, perhaps!
