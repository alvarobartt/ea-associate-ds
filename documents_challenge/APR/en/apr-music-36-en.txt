after first listening to this album, i found it strange, somewhat in line with what we proposed muse ships, and what is more worse ... but i had the opportunity to see them in concert and there, i rediscovered the album: the guitar is powerful tripe, electro arrangements that magnify the voice of matthew bellamy, all sprinkled with the immense talent of musicians make this album a monument huge, gigantic , different, certainly, but very original, and in the vein of a musical evolution of the group muse ... the revolution is underway ... listen especially "soldier's poem", which is an absolutely sublime ride, "take a bow "(to vent), or" invincible "... no, listen to everything ... the muse has a soul, discover it through his music ... good listening!
