yes the songs are pretty and there are no false notes. but hey, the voice is a little too high pitched and without much originality and licked his too, too calibrated, too "télérama" (sorry). and then what "down on my knees" tends to irritate me, i found unworthy to kneel before that which is ... it makes me think that jacques brel song "let me become the shadow of your shadow." it is a bit whiny ... anyway, that's a nice album "wallpaper" for dinners with friends but no more ...
