the graphics in this animation is superb, but i found the story very little success. disquiet in the kingdom, one senses the dragons and their attendant evils. the king's son is indeed quite upset, everyone looks for. his father is when he gets him a dagger which kills. the son steals a sword, fled with encounter wolves who are in difficulty and a magician who saves. but even the magic fails in the kingdom. our two cohorts were hosted by two women at the miyazaki father whose great hope. unfortunately, the confrontation with the forces associated with bad magic dragon mode triggers a great show, but in which i have not seen the atmosphere of beautiful and profound truth that is usually found at ghibli. this expectation is so disappointed. apart from the triumph of good over evil after a big weakness of the first, there is neither explained nor suggested i think to understand what happened previously. i myself am left on my hunger. i do not think in any case that this movie is for those who have not read the story which is said to be inspired. the talented graphic is yet present, and it may be that what i see as serious defects ultimately turns out to be a weakness of youth.
