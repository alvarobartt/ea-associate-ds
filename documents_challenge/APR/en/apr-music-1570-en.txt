the most famous album remained unreleased and unpublished musical revolution when it was created in 1967 by brian wilson, smile remained unfinished at a stage following the psychotic breakdown of its creator. smile has won a great success when presented live and the studio album deserves success on stage. initially intitu√© dumb angel, then young symphony to god is the name of smile that is expected in 1967 by connoisseurs. it was not until 37 years later we can finally enjoy a research and musical complexity that can arise only in the mind of a genius in pain: and yet, smile, which can be stored in any style is a very happy album. a masterpiece that makes us happy.
