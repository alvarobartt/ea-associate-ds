this book is recommended as a pioneer of the gothic novel, and yet i have not found much interest. the same preface, one interesting passage seems to affirm that it is a great novel. maybe i did not have the sensitivity required to read this novel, but i was very disappointed. but this is only a personal opinion, and it should not be discouraged to read if you have really want. ^ ^
