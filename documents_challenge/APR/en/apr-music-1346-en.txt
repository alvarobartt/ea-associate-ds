when we think of the pioneers of electronic music, immediately names as necessary depeche mode, kraftwerk, human league ... and curiously one of gary numan far behind! yet it enjoyed a successful result across the channel from 79 to 82, besides the year 1979 will be the "numanoid"! it was during this period that left the "pleasure principle" which radically changed the content of the punk squall that came to plague in england, and both the musical side that dress! cold, dark, trippy, robotics are some adjectives describing the sound played by a bass, drums and synths that now seem outdated, but who at the time were quite innovative (it must be said that there were 30 years have a computer that was already the stuff of science fiction !!!). all titles are the same register and the leader wire is called "cars" (# 1 sept.79) effective at any point of view proves that electronic music can move while being technically limited (when i think of what it has become today ...). "complex" (# 6 in 79) is not bad either in his way while adding a touch of violin very well tailored, when to "me", "movies" and my favorite "metal" they end up yourself! critics have beautiful it as a knock in bowie, he has not however been able to influence artists as diverse and varied just through the holy spirit! finally i think!
