honestly, i expected much more from a person revolving around this environment. in balance i mostly learned that a little mr.mer sharing the same opinion as everyone else on the political world without really bringing anything new . the few anecdotes he provides are not studied and used most often just to make a number or draw the ire of the reader to such behavior, but that ignores them? without constructive analysis it does absolutely nothing to the debate ... disappointing .. really.
