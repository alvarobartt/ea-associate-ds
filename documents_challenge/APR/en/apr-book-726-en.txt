it's so fun to dive back into this story! it is then a small addition to the trilogy "at the crossroads of the worlds", very short, which recounts the meeting between the aeronaut lee scoresby and the bear yorek byrnison. i loved finding these two characters with the style of the author that i love so much. a real treat, get it without hesitation if you liked the trilogy!
