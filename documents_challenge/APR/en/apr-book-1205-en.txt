the stone council is a profound boredom. after the brilliance of crimson rivers, one falls asleep while reading the council ... improbable, caricatured characters, without consistency, the fate fussy. i found painful use of characters-children who eventually only pass in the text, without any personality. and these links with the sixties-eighters ... phew! on painful. provide opportunities for people you hate.
