this disc is really the result of 2 above. nothing has changed, the mixture group rage against the machine + the former soundgarden frontman is still effective. a little softer than the previous 2, revelations is an extremely enjoyable disc to listen. it may be noted much effect on guitars like there were always in rage and audioslave. in short, a very good cd to buy if you liked the prev. by cons, if you've been disappointed by audioslave and out of exile, not worth spending your money on this one. we like it or not ...
