they talk about madeleine peyroux as a child of lady day, revealed after a course of galleys, the street, etc. ... i longed to see in real life on stage. what i have done (marseille five continents, july 2005) and unfortunately i can no longer listen to this disc in the same ear. i even want to listen is saying! a weak and timid voices, static postures, no word in public, a level of guitar playing worthy of passing on a festival stage. the audience was bored, so musicians who have done neither solo or improvisation, only reproduce the recordings note for note. it was the worst jazz concert that i saw, i came to complain and i sometimes bad for her. madeleine peyroux may be more comfortable in a repertoire of country music, but jazz is not that ... as soon fell a blow, that's a shame.
