this film is an updated version of one of the ancient heresies of christianity namely arianism. jesus is created but not of the same nature as god. he is a man and only witness (preferred) of god. this is a radical heresy condemned by the church because jesus is the perfect union and without mixture of god and man. scorcese think jesus as arius did, and reducing it to its single dimension of man speaks of someone other than jesus. it is therefore an image of invention, as such, can handle any deviations and other musings. this film is the christian perspective, useless and false.
