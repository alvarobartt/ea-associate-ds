i bought this movie based on comments and press reviews. it is a deception for me. although the film is particularly crazy but that is past history. with some (rare) moments quite well, it all feels very strongly series z (assumed to remain). even the plastic advantageous highlighted by actress has succeeded in making me look positively to this slapstick horror cobbled. question of taste perhaps.
