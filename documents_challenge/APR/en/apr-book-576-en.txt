jk rowling has managed a tour de force with this tome, which is still better than 4, i think! although not necessarily as many actions as in earlier, she managed to keep the pressure on the player right from the 2nd chapter ... revelations about voldemort's past is very interesting and the hundred last pages of the book are really the highlight of the series with the rebirth of voldemort in volume 4! moreover, if many people have a grudge against a particular character at the end of the book, because we think it is an infamous traitor, but this character is probably made much more subtle by the author, by his relationship with dumbledore and harry ... in short, the final volume promises to be exciting and will probably be the culmination of a saga that has been dreaming big and small
