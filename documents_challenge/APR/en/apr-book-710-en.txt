i am quite amazed at the rave reviews that i can meet. the idea of this book is certainly original, but then to say that it is a great book, no i do not agree. firstly, from the outset, i was embarrassed by the interminable length sentences. some make more than one page! then, i think the author could have avoided many details and comparisons with its genesis. i think that everyone is not interested in the interpretations of rashi and friedman. especially since it brings no light on the quest. nevertheless, we want to reach the end whether you learn more about those missing. in short, a well researched book but suffers from its length and unnecessary details.
