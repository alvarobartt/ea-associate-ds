honestly who considers this as the best album radiohead will have to explain myself! i'm a fan of radiohead undisputed at the time of the first three cds and most of ok computer but frankly i'm there to listen and hear it again i do not know the trick! perhaps thom yorke and his pals wanted to surprise everyone, well at least it worked on me! this is not the radiohead that i know and loved! after those who love i hope they do not try to convince themselves that the 4th album of their favorite band is as good as the previous but really like this cd but in these cases i would advise them both a cd of tibetan relaxation because that is what i found in kid a! now i hope that some will not take a bad review because this album that i consider to miss!
