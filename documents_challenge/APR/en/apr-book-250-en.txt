a book very pleasant to receive a gift, (i tell you from experience) where you will tour the charlotte not only by the various proposed revenue but also because after having made a few and be familiar with the principle, it is very easy to improvise your charlotte suit your tastes and desires! flat minor, however, this edition marabout is a little expensive compared to the number of recipes offered. other formats marabout still more interesting in terms of pricing, but are not specialized in a particular dish, so feel free to choose ... it is true that if you have a passion for charlotte or other books available, "crumbles" salty or sweet, "tiramisu", why not. ps: is it necessary to clarify? very well illustrated as always with marabou!
