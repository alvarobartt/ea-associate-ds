excellent british series in 8 episodes of 50 minutes. the series was not renewed because of hearing, sometimes i have trouble understanding people! amy is enrolled in the ghost squad, a unit to infiltrate the police in order to expose police ripoux . the screenplay treatment of different episodes is very sharp: drama, constant questioning, paranoia, social analysis, everything is there. it is far from the action series with two bullets without any substance. if we add the performance of elaine cassidy in the role of amy, we get a gem not to be missed.
