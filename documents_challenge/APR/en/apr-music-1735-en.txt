in my memory, claude fran√ßois was a picture full of flakes with a soft voice. so i wanted to rediscover a little one who was considered a super professional song ... and it was. it'sa big disappointment that this disc will please fans but the most ardent. all tracks are chained at full speed with no breathing, to satisfy an audience of groupies. fast tempos, sound pete-dry voice nazillarde. what this disc: ah, if i had a hammer!
