we really feel that manu chao has done for us! if the simplicity of clandestino has captivated with the sound of the street typically latin and freshness of novelty, for proxima estacion he really did not crowd the text is worthy of a child of three years, and about music ... except one or two new three-note melodies, everything has been reheated several times. i am so disappointed by this album i will listen to the next not sure if there is one.
