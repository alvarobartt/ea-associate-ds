here is a movie i saw the pedigree of its director, without knowing the subject. i thought at least be entitled to a portrait "vitriolic" of the british monarchy! and not at all! here's a nice little turnip well as it should, thoughtful, very monarchical "clean", and so british, with a labor minister, gaucho-caviardos, who likes his quiquin. the subject? the death of the idol of a certain press, and the horrors of the queen mother: i'm going? i'm not? completely uninteresting. reassure yourself, even pesudo-engaged as frears did not touch certain things. appallingly zero.
