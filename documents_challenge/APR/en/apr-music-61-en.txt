nothing to do with the first 2 albums, a music very stripped (very little bass guitar almost non-existent, no scratches ....) soft battery and some electronic sounds. equal to the singer herself. i have chosen 2 songs really good: machine gun and threads, the first leads to a change in portishead (drums and heavy industrial property jerky) and the second an unhealthy mind as some pieces of the first album. that's all, remains the top and the voice of the singer a little questionable at times. for the neophyte, but it's nice for those qui's'attendaient a result of the first 2 albums ...
