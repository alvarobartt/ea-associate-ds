third coben novel i read, and while both first captivated me, this time i remained a bit on my hunger. unlike previous or i found the scenario very well built with always surprising twist, this this time the story seemed much less polished, almost like it was written too quickly and without much thought. too bad, but the quality of my previous 2 will give the benefit of the doubt to the author i think back into another of his novels during my readings.
