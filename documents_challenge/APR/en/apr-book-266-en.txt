this book is very uneven, as its title clearly suggests, biased. mr kervasdoue use of its scientific legitimacy to express opinions written in the heat of anger, and sometimes badly reasoned. in the first chapter, he attempts to demonize the nature (is this a good scientific attitude?). so everything is "natural" would be toxic and unfit for human consumption. cocaine is highlighted as one of these natural poisons. quid then aspirin, penicillin and much of our pharmacy is also natural, and he said nothing? throughout the chapters, the argument becomes more sedate. it even learns things very interesting, especially in the field of medical statistics, the gap between media and scientific reality. it is a pity therefore that the facts calmly exposed the author is the annoying habit of jumping to hasty conclusions and often questionable. he wants to challenge conventional wisdom, but contradicts himself repeatedly. apart from the interests of the facts presented, we end up wondering where he is coming from. his conclusion is finally borrows the same pessimism found among environmentalists that criticism, although it obviously has different solutions. in presenting things too biased, i think of mr kervasdoue not convince large world. it will only grist to the mill of those who already have a close view of his own.
