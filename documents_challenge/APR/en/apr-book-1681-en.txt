we know that crichton's recipe is to mix adventure with scientific or industrial. the problem is that it does not always balance. he had met with jurassic park, sphere or prisoners of time but there , crichton has done too much documentation. it is therefore interesting in the beginning, we learn the names of small pieces that make an airplane but in the end as we advance, we are eager to finish the novel not by suspence but to conclude, simply. basically the suspense is what has triggered strong shocks in an airplane, even when shocks have caused deaths (including the famous pilot) and many wounded. we learn the reason for the end, but meanwhile, it's still pretty boring. however, moments or crichton discusses the power of the press and its methods of operation i have been very interesting. in conclusion, it is a fairly boring book or history is not very exciting. and as the information we crichton book in his novels usual, here they are mostly uninteresting. crichton's novel therefore not essential.
