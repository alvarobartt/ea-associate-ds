for fifteen years i listen to metal, i rarely hear an album as great as the 'fourth legacy'. the worst of these pieces can compete peacefully with what groups are best known best in style ... between pieces of speed extremely powerful and refined as' the fourth legacy 'or' until kingdom come ', others inspired by traditional music ( "nights of arabia' arab 'the shadow of uther', celtic) and even a beautiful ballad ( "a sailorman's hymn ') is a real fireworks we invite kamelot. the technical frieze too perfect, the beautiful voice of roy s. khan (ex-conception) rubbed with excellent guitar solos, supported by parts of keyboard, just recall the use made of the design including xylophone sounds. add more than that, unlike many albums, it will improves with every listen?
