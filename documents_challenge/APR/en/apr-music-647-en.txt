johnny has already done it ... went into hiding in nashville some time he had found, in the years 70-80 retreat at its size that had yielded some pearls with local musicians. only now, he had faith, and blues in him at the time, and sing the blues is never easy, it's music of the soul, sadness, right after the cotton fields; difficult internalize a fugitive swiss tax ... for our national jojo is primarily a singer (a huge, certainly) varieties, and not a talented bluesman. however, he rubbed by a directory too ambitious for its resources. i had the privilege to listen to preview the new album, and e result may disappoint both fans who can not find the usual codes of his music, especially blues fans who will see that there a commercial salvage attempt failed ... so: a succession of songs "bluesisantes, more caricatured each other, and to top it all, a song written by bono of u2, which has nothing to do on an album blues claimed, since s' acts in a variety of songs, sung more in english by johnny (emphasis catastrophic !!!!) who must do good laugh if bono has played ... in short: a complete crash, on the whole line, but will surely given a box of marketing his new record company has held but which will certainly disappointed ... two stars anyway for some nets votes still to johnny, even if it sometimes seems he does not believe in himself ... the dvd does nothing except printing marketing awkward for us to forget the more than mediocre quality of this production. johnny is not made for intimate concerts and songs, is a stage animal that go to the philharmonic orchestras or large rock formations ... planting.
