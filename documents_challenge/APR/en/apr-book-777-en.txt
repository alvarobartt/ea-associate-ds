the story is nice. five young cres club court in their establishment and are "keeping order" in their own way. the characters are ambiguous and endearing at will. the story is expanding gradually moving up the final volume of five (it's nice to finally have a manga that has a purpose ...). overwhelming. the only downside for me is the graphics a bit strange initially because i'm used to the manga characters that look alike, lol.le pencil is singular, but it very quickly and may even be that it makes them more "human" ...
