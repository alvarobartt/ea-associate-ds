probably the best album of smashing pumpkins, and 90s in general, this double album full of classic hits like els bullet with butterfly wings, zero, tonight tonight and 1979, songs less known but extremely powerful as jellybelly and muzzle. the flat just as the double album is not really justified, they could remove several ways to make them fit on one disc, we'd lost nothing. a great album to discover the group, in all its splendor.
