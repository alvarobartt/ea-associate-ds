i am this series, i found excellent, since the release of seasons 1, 2 and 3. i never watched season 3 because i do not understand english or italian and my poor eyesight prevents me from reading the french subtitles! i stopped buying the seasons as they are not dubbed into french. i just bought this integral amazon. com presents languages english, french and italian, "hoping to finally play in french seasons 3 through 6. well that's impossible! the last four seasons of this integral are again doubled in italian! provided that this is a completely useless purchase. his description by amazon.fr is illegal, because it suggests that the entire series is presented in audio versions english, italian and french, which is not the case!
