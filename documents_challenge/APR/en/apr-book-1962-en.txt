before having a rabbit, it is useful to learn. and without going into details too technical or a medical textbook, this book is perfect for a beginner. just explaining everything there is to know about dwarf rabbits, breeds, housing, food, etc. this book is perfect for large and small. prefer a more recent edition because it contains but a few small errors (it does not toast bread or a rabbit).
