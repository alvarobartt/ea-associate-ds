first mr. carter album, reasonable doubt. on the first listen is they're conquered, the songs cascading one after another and never disappoint. whether can not knock the hustle and dead presidents ii, you do not get tired. it is simply incredible, and we resentment well he kept everything in him to swing on the killings. it is also the first appareance of memphis bleek, which was only 16 years. with single memorable as is not no nigga (feat foxy brown), this album this class as standard. for every fan of jay-z and even hip-hop. has not missed.
