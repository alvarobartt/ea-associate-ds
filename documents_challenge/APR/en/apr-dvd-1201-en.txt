the first season sopano was already wonderful, but the second is sensational, the characters find themselves more and more we are eager to know their future and their stories. weaknesses of the sponsor (tony) are beautifully handled and highlighting, i recommend this integral as sincerely as i can make far u.s. tv standards, the series does not hesitate to challenge against the politically correct and successful to make us lovable (and devilishly believable) characters, however heinous activities. if you like "the sopranos" you can not lose you.
