a very interesting book mostly consists of flashbacks that allows those who have seen the three films to connect thanks to the appearance of many characters in "legends of metru nui" and "the threat of darkness" in brief a very good novel punctuated with many touches of humor. we only regret that this book does not get us a few pages on the situation left unresolved at the end of the third book. for fans: must-read
