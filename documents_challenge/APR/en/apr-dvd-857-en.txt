i do not agree very extreme in some earlier comments visually, this third episode, full of pure wonders, fighting space, sets, costumes ... brief all art direction and visual effects, design of the most simple designs to entire planets (see kashyyk planet of wookies that resembles halong bay ...) are amazing. unfortunately, the conversion of anakin to the dark side is a little easy for my taste and the image of this point clearly essential to the coherence of the whole saga, i find this scenario iii a bit lighter .. . this is still a splendid entertainment to tell everything and a must for any lover of sf in general and especially star wars
