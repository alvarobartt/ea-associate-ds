if i think a previous review, the original style (english) by r. sennett is sometimes a little difficult. this probably explains in part the very bad translation here. parts of this short book are incomprehensible and overall style is very laborious. reading is often painful. another object of disappointment: the analysis of evolution of capitalism as we book the author is very detailed, sometimes innovative and original, often very smart and built, for example anything that relates to the report time and the consequences on the lives of organizations, the concept of profession, etc.. but when it comes to propose other ways, the best there is not much, at worst, suddenly re-watching utopias of the extreme left of the 60s such as paying the domestic work. just like a doctor who would make the correct diagnosis, but would have no remedy to propose ... too bad.
