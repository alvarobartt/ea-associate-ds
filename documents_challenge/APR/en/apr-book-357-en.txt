although most "dark" than the first volume, "the negligible" is an album equally, or even a little more exciting and poignant than the first. again, larcenet demonstrated his talent for expressing the emotions of his characters (very endearing) and play with us! he manages to combine humor, seriousness, depth, emotion and sensitivity to such an extent that is rare, the reader is able to "feel" this album! an essential album for all!
