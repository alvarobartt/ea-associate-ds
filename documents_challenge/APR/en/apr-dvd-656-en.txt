i love comedies, and i greatly appreciate the coen brothers (barton fink, the big lebowski, fargo, and the barber are the most successful works) but as one commentator said of amazon, the coen brothers can do better ... so two stars: 1 star for the first scene, the scene of the cuckolded husband, a scene of anthology! 1 star chaptering quality, choice of languages (french, english (for vo), arabic, bulgarian), subtitles (french and english) ... and a remarkable bonus (the b√©tisier, the wardrobe and behind the scenes ...) in short, history, style is the arch-deja-vu ... and worse, the grotesque, a caricature too forced, and a few good replies, the whole is disappointing ...
