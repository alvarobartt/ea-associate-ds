disappointing, and yet it is an old fan of 42 years who speaks or rather writes. this album marks the end of a long collaboration between a. vandenbergh and coverdale, the idea is laudable, many other have had before, but the chemistry does not, the compounds have no taste, the voice is not what it was (see live in the heart of the city), and most songs do not lend themselves to this transformation too intimiste.quant the guitar parts, they feel improvisation made quickly, without any real harmony with the voice. a book for fans (including myself). go and throw yourself on the first period of the white snake (ready and willing, slide it up in 5 albums essential, and timeless, speaking of old old fan!)
