a topic that catches which offends, disturbs, which could have a classic of modern literature: a tv reality pushes voyeurism and cruelty to the extreme by replacing the loft by a concentration camp where kapos defeat the imprisoned, and where two prisoners per day are selected to be eliminated early by kapos, then by the public. add one of the most unhealthy relationship between a beautiful rebel and a prisoner kapo stupid and lesbian, and you have the latest nothomb: catchy .... and not much behind, no style, little substance, little realism (on the incarcerated candidate strength and disposed ... what country are we?) and a study of characters very superficial. yet i, who lives in england, where a young woman-after reality tv, has died of cancer death in a very public and the media, certainly the intention of it, i think that the scenario of acid sulfuric is not so far from the (tv) reality that!
