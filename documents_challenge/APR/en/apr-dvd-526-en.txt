i love the humor and the quality of interpretation of jean-paul rouve, either in or in, among others, and i hoped to find there, in a film where he played the leading role and is even the embodiment, a concentrate of very good to him. then of course, jean-paul rouve is very good in its interpretation of the hero megalomaniac and idealistic, and it gives us some replicas faithful to what i expected from him. but the duration of the film, the good times are lost in a plot not very catchy, when you put small pieces of "case" that led to his mare spaggiari a somewhat chaotic and not very well-staged between the longest interviews between journalist and hero. the moments that should be more voltage generators are unfortunately too cluttered, probably due to using too many ellipses, so that feels a bit of adrenaline flow, thus making the film very flat. and when comes the end credits, it retains a slightly bitter feeling of a film that could be very good but is ultimately disappointing. i hope jean-paul rouve will draw the appropriate lessons to give us great movies in the future - he is certainly capable of it!
