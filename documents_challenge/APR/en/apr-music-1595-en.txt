there are those for whom the album ray charles at newport (with its legendary cover where we see ray charles on stage standing with his alto sax) is an absolute must. i am one of those there. there are also those who remember with emotion of a 33t 25cm atlantic no. 332,011, yellow, published in france under the title "the great ray charles concert" recorded at herndon stadium in atlanta may 28, 1959. well, this cd ray charles live, is more than the sum of 33 t, but the full two concerts. indeed tracks 1 through 9 of the cd resume all tracks recorded by ray charles at newport july 5, 1958 with bonus "swanee river rock" not on the original album tracks 10 to 16, 7 beaches 33t of the original "grand concert of ray charles" originality of these recordings: ray charles is not yet known superstar with his shows well resolved. he even balance between jazz and blues ryhthm. we can hear songs of pure instrumental jazz: hot rod, blues waltz, in a little spanish town, sherry for newport, frenesi and the spirit-feel for atlanta. titles are sung all extraordinary. special mention, however, to "a fool for you", "drown in my own tears" and "tell the truth" in which marjorie hendricks and ray charles interact in a trance incredible! for side of ray charles: newport: david newman (sax tenor), hank hank crawford (baritone sax), lee harper, marcus belgrave (trumpet), edgar willis (bass) richie goldberg (drums), the realets with marjorie hendricks. atlanta: david newman (tenor sax), hank crawford hank ( baritone sax), john hunt and marcus belgrave (trumpet), edgar willis (bass) teagle fleming (drums), the realets with marjorie hendricks. this cd that fifty years after its registration as we always vibrate is a genuine document phonograph. for some of these moments are gone forever.
