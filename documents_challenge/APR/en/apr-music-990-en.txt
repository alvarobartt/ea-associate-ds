after the beautiful and melancholy songs inspired from the previous albums, coldplay is "marketization", with output formatted for the big hit. this album is gay, gay, which is not always unpleasant, but the spirit is there more. it reminds me of the corners of the same type of tears for fears with their "the seeds of love", or simple minds and after their album "sparkle in the rain" or cure in 1985 or even back in time, and genesis supertramp in 1980. well, okay, references date back somewhat, but it's the same principle: a failure to engage the clutch on the highway of success worldwide, in more or less denying his mind, and adapting his personality. unless it is simply down to inspiration. this development seems unfortunately classic, but not mandatory.
