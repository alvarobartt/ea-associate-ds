how to say ... this book leaves the beaten path of fantasy. here you will find no evil sauron and middle-earth to protect (not that i do not appreciate the fantasy "classic") but a different approach to this style, which encourages the reader to think. without rewriting what others have rightly written, this book is different, instructive, since the gains are being questioned, and pushes the reader to question notions of good and evil, " order and chaos. "a separate book of course, but beautiful as any fan of fantasy should read under pain of missing a masterpiece.
