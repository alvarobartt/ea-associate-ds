this adaptation of jane austen's novel is a success. very true to the spirit of the novel (a little less in form, certain elements are actually derived from a preliminary version of the published novel), she recounts exellant this moving story of a "second chance". this second chance that jane austen probably did not have, hence the accuracy of the description of the feelings of a woman who has only not always deserving family to cherish. this second chance that jane austen knows so well described, and that adaptation makes perfect, landscapes and more. the interpretation is very good, the physics of actors (and actresses) better stick to the characters in the earlier adaptation of the bbc.
