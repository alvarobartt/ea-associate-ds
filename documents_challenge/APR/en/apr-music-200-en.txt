between the nervous and impatient interpretation of spinoza and the latter, i much prefer that of spinoza, although it is by no means perfect. these two interpretations are completely opposite from each other. i bought this version to me based on various opinions, almost all excellent, found on various international amazon sites (u.s., uk, germany). but what a disappointment! yes, the voices (especially female voices) are sumptuous and marilyn horne is at the top, but it's heavy and slow. the recitatives do not finish and lack authenticity. contrary to various opinions, i think this record has aged very badly. one wonders whether this is an oratorio than an opera: it lacks drama, action and dynamism. the interpretation is mainly oriented technology (often superhuman) singers. technically the sound is miserable and disks were partitioned so completely random. one wonders why some recitatives between arias were divided into several parts and why, secondly, some tunes were glued to recitatives without division. i no longer listen to these discs and i am not surprised that vivaldi's operas have been rediscovered with recordings of recent years.
