i'm usually "public good" but there is too much. i have rarely seen such bad adaptation of an excellent book. i have nothing against romantic trifles (there are some who like it) but it should not be called "the last of the mohicans". while the book is the real hero uncas, chingachgook's son raised by his father and hawk-eye a scout white one wonders what use has the mohicans in this film ... "nothing of course. do not buy this dvd with no interest. instead buy the book. written in the early nineteenth century it spoke, among other things, the love of an indian for a white woman, and the risks it is ready to take to try to free her.
