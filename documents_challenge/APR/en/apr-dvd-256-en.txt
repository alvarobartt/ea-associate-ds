here is a film that is not one. no text no no player in history and yet everyone can build his scenario. for some mystical, spiritual for others, or simply travel images. no matter, we must dare to let go, stop trying to put words when it is useless and will be invaded by this film is the image and music. try the experience. because it is the right word. long live ron fricke dead can dance and lisa gerrard (listen to his cd duality)
