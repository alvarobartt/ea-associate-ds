i am surprised to read all these rave reviews on a book, for my part, i did not like. maybe because i'm rather a daughter of north and exuberance, "banter" any latin characters i quickly tired. maybe because i could not get interested in this vague story writer and cursed devil burner of books. anyway, i have not joined the plot and i was really hard to finish the book. matter of taste.
