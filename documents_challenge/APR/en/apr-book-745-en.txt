this book is the classic on the topic. the indications and properties defined by the author are correct (which is not always the case in other books). it is unusual to combine essential oils and other alternative medicine techniques that may be useful. however, we can blame him for not being sufficiently precise and detailed. the author does not prove that advance scientific studies. i have this book for 10 years and i still consult him, although i have others that are more complete.
