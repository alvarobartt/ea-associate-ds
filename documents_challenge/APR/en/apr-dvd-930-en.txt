definitely my favorite french films because it combines humor, interesting historical background (dominated barren, wild and crazy white on black) and dialogues incredibly good, the final scene in the harbor is one example. but above scenario, the story of a simpleton humiliated by him and decides not to stay there, takes you by the throat because the person who was compassionate to the top turns imperceptibly to as executioner ... or evil? or is good? this masterpiece made me think bcp.
