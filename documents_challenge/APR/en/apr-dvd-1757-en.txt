a witness live this fabulous guitarist who can be twisted to one that does not sing. the tab hendrix of course this is because robin would openly claim even if he never played a single piece of hendrix. this is a "best of" live very well recorded that i would urge those who want to know what a guitarist. its start sounds really god of fire and the man has lost none of its force. with one of the best combos in its history. must for fans of blues-rock and walks (ah, the fabulous daydream, we do not get tired after 30 years ..)
