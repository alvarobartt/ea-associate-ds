it is rare that i inflicts such punishment by reading a novel, i glanced at it for several years and its output pocket gave me the opportunity to satisfy my greed. but what a disappointment in the crowd was a long chat with several voices of characters brought together by the final of the european cup soccer in 1986 which culminated in the heysel tragedy. they are the narrators of events occurring before, during and after the tragedy. the monologues succeed, boring and monotonous, without change of pace so it was sometimes hard to realize that going from one character to another. you can easily skip entire paragraphs without missing the plot of the novel as it does almost nothing happening. the breaths are rare but instead of giving it a dark oppressive atmosphere in deep trouble. we're torn between wanting to close the book forever and that of the finish as quickly as possible to switch to something more substantial.
