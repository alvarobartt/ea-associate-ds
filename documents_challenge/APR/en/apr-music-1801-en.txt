oasis promised much on the new album (supposedly second best album of the group after liam gallagher), and this is not the single shock of the lightning that came to contradict this promise: classy and brilliant, the song evokes the oasis great days (). and listening to the album in its entirety, what is it? we must recognize that certain songs stand out: waiting for the rapture, completely in tune with the times through the white stripes (without addition), get off your high horse lady direct descendant of the psyche tunes (but not revolution) falling down splendid pop song (but genius). still, oasis did not discard his heavy artillery later that spoils all the songwriting of noel gallagher, the drawling, nasal liam even at times frankly irritating: it discourages listening to is not got nothing for example, or the turning (which is anything but name as the song is not at all a shift in the band's career). the fans will be delighted the fans what oasis was in the 90s will be partially satisfied, skeptics are not convinced.
