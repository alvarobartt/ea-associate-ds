it is true that machiavelli is now a reference. however, i do not agree with opinions that describe a book as clear. i find it very difficult to read. i understand that style is like that because it's a book there are many hundreds of years, then translated into french. i do not criticize its content because it is true that his ideas are very rich and very daring. but if i do an objective review, i hesitate not to say that it is not affordable for all gentleman-the-world. if you are not a true literary, it will be very difficult to finish.
