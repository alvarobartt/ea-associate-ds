on seeing the beginning of the film it could have been good (especially the idea that the scenario was not so bad), but unfortunately after one quarter of an hour it gets boring, one wonders, in fact when the action will really begin, in fact it never started. regarding the choice of the actor taking the lead role, one wonders what he has done here, how can we believe that this little skinny (out of 28 days in a coma!) will, by itself, eliminate a small dozen military (supposed to be super-super-equipped and trained!) and, in passing, killing a few "zombies" (hence the word is strong, we must see the heads of zombies, howling with laughter!) blows bat baseball. as for the zero end like everything else! in short everything comes together to make this film a true turnip, a flat film on the whole line, a badly operated scenario, bad actors, a soundtrack of poor quality, very poor special effects and especially the height for a horror movie it does not afraid! " how could i take to the end ..... i ask again.
