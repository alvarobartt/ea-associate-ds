then, take 4 guys who have already made some albums, slamming their dough galore, getting up one morning saying "if we did another one?" basically, it's red hot ac, "californication" is not so far, and you can hear, "by the way" looks strangely (too) single from the eponymous album, and it is the same songs such throughout the album, the last notes out, one wonders if we did not buy 2 times the same album with different cover for the draft in 2002. they just abuse, it is a bit much; you wonder if flea would not have done better to skip the car and stay there while filming the video for "by the way";
