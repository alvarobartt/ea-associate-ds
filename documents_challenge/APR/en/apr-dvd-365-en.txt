this film proves that some hollywood writers are running out of ideas! how can we come here! consolidate all the monsters of horror films, dracula, frankenstein, dr. jeckyll, werewolves, ... to make a movie hero as van helsing, vampire hunter, a sort of james bond of old, whose sole purpose of fighting a megalomaniac dracula! with this film, which certainly is well made and has very nice special effects, it falls well below! i do not even count the anachronisms that do not really bother the writers!
