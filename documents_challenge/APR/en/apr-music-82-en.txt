i so loved the 1st album of this artist that i bought it with his eyes closed! if you want to find the same style, same type of pop-rock melodies, go your way! this album gives me the impression that paolo nutini has gone hibernating in the united states for years 50/60 (many elvis tunes style ...), made a leap into a country music concert and eventually get caught to cat stevens (i like a lot but also when he really sings!). in addition, large black spot for me, the artist eats his words, almost no interlinks and suddenly the songs become very obscure! my criticism is severe but it is up to my disappointment!
