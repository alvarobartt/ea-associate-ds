nancy mitford, author somewhat forgotten ... what a pity! here is a book sparkling with humor, finesse. the theme? love? no, instead painting drolissime of a highly coded, that of the english aristocracy and the "beautiful people" before the war which the author belonged. climate deliciously surrans nancy mitford managed to make so alive, so bubbly, she revive a atmosphere, a middle, an era in the frivolousness apparent (and misleading) subject. brilliant cartoon, immortal, never boring reading that will delight fans of english spirit, the nostalgia ... and the comics, you laugh on every page and it asks for more.
