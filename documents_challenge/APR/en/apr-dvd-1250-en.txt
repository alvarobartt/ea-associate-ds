it is now several years that i watch these films through their first dvd editions (the 1999). passing blu-ray, it's been a shock. no more rotting macroblocking each plan and video noise in dark areas. the picture is excellent, so clear that it was hard to believe that the film has more than 20 years. we feel that the colors were a bit handled and they are a little more saturated, but it is hardly noticeable. the sound is very clear, both in stereo 5.1. the only small regret: the glaring lack of bonus. but hey, if you have a large screen at home: go for it. it's worth it just for the picture. ps: for those who criticize the image quality of this edition blu-ray: i did a comparison on a screen 2m40 basic and jean de florette is as beautiful to watch as pirates of the caribbean 2 (which is supposed to be the best blu-ray never pressed), then review your settings ;-) jean de florette / manon des sources films are sharp in terms of image, one can appreciate that a perfectly calibrated equipment.
