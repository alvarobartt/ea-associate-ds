hi to all fans of the series. on learning that the volume 10 is left to reprint inspired me the following opinion: well done! it will teach you! it will teach you to change the format of a book being set. it will teach you to change the price range during the series! it will teach you to be addicted to the stupid and cows! and more seriously, you imagine the shock and look at my library to see beyond the 10th tome in my row of anita blake! monk would find himself in a straitjacket for much less than that! finally, i assume that good fan, captive and cow milk, i will not have the patience to wait for a paperback edition ! how pathetic! i am hurting :-(
