too short! the scenario was all: simple but effective (vampires come to jou-jou with the inhabitants of a city plunged into darkness for 30 days) but once you turn the last page we can only disappointed and frustrated by the laziness of its authors! ok the pages of this album are excellent, especially in complete agreement with the scenario: it's dark and brief moments of light only serve to highlight the bright red blood, the eyes of their prey and hunters or illuminate a landscape dissolves into a thick fog ... and apart from that? well not much point! the characters are pathetic (if people there a. .. they have the charisma of an oyster, no psychology, yet there should be room for pondering when it is cut off from the world and hunted by vampires!) in short we finished after 10 minutes the feeling of having done that (as a great trailer for a film that proves to be a good turnip)
