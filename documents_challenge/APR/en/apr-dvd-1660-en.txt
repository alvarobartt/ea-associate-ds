this film is an ordeal for the brain. why? because the story is bogus (zombie film you tell me it's never very complicated), the players play badly, the realization is trivial, the special effects are bad, the dialogues zero. so yes, you tell me that done on purpose to be funny but if they wanted to make us laugh, they go all the way in making us a realization of the horrible and atrocious dialogue. there, the boundary between series and z series b is very low, one hesitates between seriousness and humor (i laughed, not much). in short, a film stuck between 2 chairs or funny or serious, to avoid.
