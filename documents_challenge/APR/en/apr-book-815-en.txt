fervent reader of historical novels, i'm passionate about writing and the style of simone berti√®re. his books are easy to read, interesting, informative without being stuffed dates (as in school). they depict the life, manners of the characters with a light tone despite a rigorous reconstruction. i can only recommend these books.
