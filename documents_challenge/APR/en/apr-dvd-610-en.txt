saturday evening, i sat before the tv with friends, welcomed the idea of relaxing before a comedy so typically french (especially when you live abroad!). result: a disaster across the board, it's hard to believe that luc besson wrote the screenplay! nothing new, vulgar, not funny. in short, it was cut before the end and finished on bronz√©s history does not lie totally frustrated!
