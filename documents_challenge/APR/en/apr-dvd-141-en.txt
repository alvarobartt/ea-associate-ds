this film has not moved at all. is it due to the scenario? to staging? costumes? to music? everything is too smooth, the characters have not the strength of those in the novel. only ralph fiennes, the quality of his game, manages to give depth to heathcliff (i gave 2 stars for him). by juliette binoche cons really disappointed me, it is not at all invested in the character of cathy. and it is believed even less in the role of catherine. what has happened? as for the music ... disaster! in such landscapes, such suffering would have inspired nothing but the atmosphere of the supermarket! it would have been better not to make music at all! frankly, i prefer the old version with laurence olivier ... it is still more credible.
