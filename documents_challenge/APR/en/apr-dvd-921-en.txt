the shock! a fascinating, brutal, full of violence and bloodshed. and at the same time a poetic and dreamlike film, full of innocence. the processing of these opposing elements is orchestrated by the director of a fabulous way. the scenario is of obvious quality and the writing of the plot is original and great research. the images are all beauties, and the soundtrack is suitable for sequence shots so fabulous!. the characters are tortured and discuss this in their torments, and compete so daunting. the narrative structure has two levels (imaginary, real) is a perfect composition. actors at various levels, participate in an impressive style effect, by their minds and their games exacerbated sensitivity!. a special magic that emerges from this masterpiece and a violence of the ugliest! perhaps the film of the year for me.
