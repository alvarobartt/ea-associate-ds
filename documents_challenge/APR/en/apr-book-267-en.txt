a positive book that shows where the environment is much less serious than what some people tell us to play. in fact it is gradually improving especially in the towns under the effect of anti-pollution standards, though few people realize. (a dramatic proof once again of the difficulty of many to judge how balanced) christian gerondeau also shows the serious drawbacks of the solutions advocated by environmentalists such as using wind energy or transport. in this connection moreover, it shows the appalling wastage of the sncf. the author seeks to prove too much, however. he defends and the personal automobile while soaring oil prices in 2008 showed any development benefits of transit. a book that nevertheless throws a look of optimism on environmental issues.
