when you know that every album in the first double white were recorded in mono, which is inter ^ and the thing? only yellow submarine, abbey road and let it be were recorded and mixed in stereo ... in 2004 capitol had released u.s. versions of these albums with mono and stereo version on cd i ^ i: the mono version is much better than the faux stereo, especially for the first 4 albums. so there we want to make us pay dearly for a product that is not worth the trouble, plus the remastered mono package of 11 cd (the version to be) that die m ^ th time is more expensive, while the stereo in a 14! finally, if one wants to buy the album at retail, only the stereo version is set before us ... it really takes us for idiots!
