in 1988, the great thrash out the fine nuggets. metallica gratifies us with his "justice for all", slayer slows the pace with "south of heaven," we balance megadeth "so far, so good" and we lay anthrax "state of euphoria". but a pack of young wolves short after the top four. among the best students, here testament released their second album, "the new order". and guys do not lace. this album, more so than its predecessor and already very successful "the legacy", will propel the group among the elite. the reason is simple. testament thrash album comes out perfect. timeliness ( "the preacher", "into the pit"), powerful but melodic tracks ( "the new order", "disciples of the watch," "eerie inhabitants"), single potential ( "trial by fire") , taken concrete ( "nobody's fault" of aerosmith) and instrumental technique ( "musical death"). the entire range is out. the powerful voice of chuck billy wonders, the two guitarists play at their heart's content. alex skolnick demonstrates once again his talent on very inspired solos. all this makes this "new order" a piece of thrash, nothing less. notice to those who do not have it!
