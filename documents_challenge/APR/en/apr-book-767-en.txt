paper unnecessary. the book is not practical at all. he must inspect several minutes to find the product you are looking for. all the info there is in this book are easily available on internet. as for the list of products from leading brands, needless to say that the lobby smells food, full nose. it is neither more nor less than disguised advertising. i really regret this purchase.
