a very good thriller erotic love in which meg ryan is unrecognizable, far from romantic comedies in which we see normally. a killer of women cut into pieces, and a cop comes meg ryan interview at his home, because the body was discovered in the courtyard of his building. only now, our meg (who is professor of literature and which has only its sister company more saucy she) believes that he was a man seen in a bad posture evening in a bar. but the plot becomes more complex, and we no longer know who to trust. in short, a good thriller with an unexpected fall, obviously. good evening in perspective that you have not yet seen!
