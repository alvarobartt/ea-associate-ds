above all, for those who do not know which of the two versions on the market is better, there is no doubt in my mind, the version langton (in contrast to that of wrigt) for which i write this commentary is by far the best, totally faithful to the work of novelist j. austen. the romantics seeking a history of water rose to abstain, the story is told here is the result of an observation followed by the society in which the author lived and is very real, with its good and its bad sides. j. austen did not write the xix but the xviii th and his work is to advance a critique of romanticism supported (see reason and feeling, another work of this writer also brought to the screen). everything in this version is admirable decorations, choice and acting, naration exciting. young men and women from all sides i can only encourage you to view this magnificent work, it is enough to draw tips for building your future happiness, even if we do not live at the same time that the novelist and the heroes have a soul far above ours. comparing the characters with their values and their respective faults you will learn a lot. you will leave this movie happy and grow up.
