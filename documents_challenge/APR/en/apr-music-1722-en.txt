after the board of kaleidoscope, kelis released this album yet (and unfairly) unreported in the united states. the concept is original: the singer intends to describe his world through pieces of life that make each song. in practice, there is obviously some pieces soup (shooting stars, scared money, mr. ufo man) that spoil the picture somewhat, but it is not important. the general atmosphere is gentle and pleasant and the text is personal and almost poetic (or on flashback digital world). it is therefore a success (despite uneven songs) whose masterpiece little suzie is without doubt the most beautiful song by kelis.
