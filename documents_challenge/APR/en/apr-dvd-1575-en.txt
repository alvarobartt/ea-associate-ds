as much as i really liked revenge of a blonde, particularly because the story was fairly original and showed moments candidly funny and sympathetic, as i was terribly disappointed by the blonde cons attack ... i had to laugh that only one or two times throughout the film, while i expected to laugh as much as before the first round. by cons i must admit that reese witherspoon is great as always:) but this film does not hold up ... unfortunately at best, however for fans of the actress and the first round if they want to know the result of his troubles:)
