my god ... it is far this time ... the authors of this book have done an absolutely remarkable (we feel the fans), built as a huge catalog of toys including all the larger saga of the toys r√©volue.au wonderful time over the pages, the kid in us wakes up and everything goes back to the surface, the smell of paper gifts, christmas trees, hot chocolate and nutella bread a book indispensable for any thirty who had the great fortune to know this magical time whose very essence is completely gone now ... sad statement for the new generations ... well, well ... i'll go very well go kiss my parents!
