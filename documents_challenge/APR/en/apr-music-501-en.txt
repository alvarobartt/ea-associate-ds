the cover is eloquent and reflective of the album: angus tries (unsuccessfully) to restore power! little or no spark, composed of linear and without true genius ... in short an album in half shade for our electric kangaroos. he prefers not hesitate let there be rock, highway to hell or back in black ... as the band puts itself on a title, angus and his band is "deep in the hole"
