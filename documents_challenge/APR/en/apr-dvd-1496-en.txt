another film inepsie right-thinking, pseudo-commitment made by rican splurge for an audience of suckers who will then s'empifrer of donuts. empty, hollow, flat, inconsistent dialogue, characters totally incredible (dinguo see the gun that the coyotes, who struggles to penthouse in the desert!), the gentle "chicano," which does not touch the other woman despite 5 years of abstinence, and invitations to the beautiful sweetish, tommy lee not masked avenger, slightly paunchy, trying to remake every film shot cop fugitives, u.s. marshall, or mib i, ii, etc. etc.. it's bad, pretentious: the poor immigrants seen by hollywood and beverly hills, the wicked "nazilons" border guards, the cowboy at large ceour. even the landscapes are poorly filmed, and become boring. and then you understand nothing with all those flashbacks! it's so disjointed that tljones has put paragraphs of distinct, superimposed on the screen, so that means i'm there again. are deeply demagogic and unhealthy (see how it treats the killer), and so programmed in advance (three burials, known after 10 minutes which they relate). still inadequate media hype, but understandably so, and in the wind. pitiful. really when the yanks gave the humanitarian here laughing the whole earth
