i left out the 3rd book in the trilogy did not end too soon but it was a beautiful mistake. both the 2nd volume is an independent history where we find the characters of 1, as is the 3 is the end of 2, neither more nor less, i'd forgotten the names of some characters and in "the queen's palace current air ", there are many (too?) characters! the intrigue already is rather" political ". bomkvist investigate sapo and a special section (how cia plot to swedish sauce). i found it much less interesting than the story of harriet vanger, missing since 20 years on an island! i love the character of lisbeth i found complicated, interesting, endearing and fairly original. in the 3rd volume, lisbeth is central to the plot but ultimately the story focuses more on what revolves around her rather than her specifically. so, this created a novel that drags on, with i-don't-know-how investigators. finally, i would say that the translation is not good, there really are phrases that sound "odd" and few authentic! to summarize, if you like lisbeth, you're not interested in political surveys, this book may disappoint you compared to the previous two. but it is true that once again the book still reads, we want to know more (although sometimes one wonders if it will happen!) and arrive at the end of the 700 pages. for me, the 1st part is definitely by far the best of the trilogy (i liked the second to the proximity with the character of lisbeth though) and the third is really the least!
