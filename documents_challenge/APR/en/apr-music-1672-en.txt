i waited impatiently démusurée this first album of beautiful tarja and i fell on top of his plays, i think i shed tears of happiness was so beautiful, perfect sound, captivating melody, rhythm rock gothic to desire, it makes it smooth and happy! a marvel! all my friends who have listened have succumbed to the charm of this disc that even within the booklet is superb with excellent picture tarja more words to think, in short we understand better why it's from nightwish, his world to me is perfect and i invite you to wallow with enjoyment! his concert in paris promises a huge and enthusiastic delivery. hopefully they make a tour across france because we love tarja and her real talent and melodic soprano outstanding. tarja, we love you to eternity!
