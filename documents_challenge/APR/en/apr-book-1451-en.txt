i expected to find a textbook designed for very young (my kids are 5 and 7): a step by step with exercises to confirm the achievements and progressive discovery not only rules but different opening, and a little strategy, while playing. but here the author was merely explaining the rules, adding a few cartoons, a few lean years and that's it. no interest.
