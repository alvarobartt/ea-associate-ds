i bought this disc for "the soldier's tale", which i discovered randomly radio programs. written for an orchestra composed of atypical instrument most acute and most severe in each family and drums, this piece is a delight. not really serious, sarcastic, full of verve and very modern, it is beautifully interpreted here, served by making her particularly excellent. the rest of the program is also the same level of interpretation and sound recording.
