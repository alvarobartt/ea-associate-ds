the author met mr ghosn the first time in 2001 and is probably the only time. this book has the merit of giving the chronology of events but there is no analysis and the author does not know much to management. too bad that mr. ghosn employees are too busy to tell what they know and have experienced. it would be interesting. we feel that the author was soon to be the first.
