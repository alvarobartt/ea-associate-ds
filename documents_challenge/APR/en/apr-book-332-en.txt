i read this book long ago (several times). he is among those that we forget. rejseberetninger magnificent gatherings of people unthinkable, description of a country so remote in space and time .............. . but as explained by small touches of witchcraft of the good, bases and daily practices of tibetan buddhism, so it is a book which describes the gradual introduction of a person who lives an adventure really unusual but is simple. do not hesitate.
