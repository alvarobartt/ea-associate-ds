yes, this album is wonderful! what feelings in this sublime voice! only sinatra could move me up there too! and yet she has not tackled simple songs; leo the great to edith piaf, from becaud and charles aznavour and reggiani, all these superstars did not shiver isabelle and blow it that we shudder to listen! not to mention his own songs that have nothing to be ashamed next to their famous neighbors! ( "tell me" is one of the 5 most beautiful songs of the past 20 years). indispensable!
