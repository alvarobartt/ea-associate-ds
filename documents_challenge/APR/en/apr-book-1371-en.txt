i have read this book through a radio or the author was invited. the clarity about brigitte proust and the subject of his book made me want to buy. and then i found incredible called proust and write a book on perfumes. for those interested in chemistry and the kitchen is the equivalent of herv√© this in the field of perfumes. in any case what is the educational aspect. i recommend this book can be read by the general public by making very modest efforts by professionals such as chemistry. it is a little book dense and well written. the author skillfully blends: anecdotes with scientific information accurate enough and experienced physical and psychological odors. so it is a rich book which reads in several dimensions. personally, i regret the use of model representation of molecular sphere, because the poor quality of graphics does not appreciate the volume. the stick model was more appropriate.
