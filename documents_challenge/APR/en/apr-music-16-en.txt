i read in a biz laudatory prose whose "mgmt are formidable songwriters" .. this is hardly the case ... besides "electric feel" i found great and made me buy the disc, the rest is disappointing. however much written about it makes me think about that + it .. i prefer listening to the originals. or listen to groups that really bring something new. after 10 plays i found the remains commonplace, with arrangements that are regression music unpleasant to the limit. title 5 is reminiscent of the bontempi organ and god knows i love this instrument! honestly next time i downloade before buying the cd ..
