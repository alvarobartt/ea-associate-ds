it is clear that linkin park has followed the guide ... the neo-metal vein has not already its adeptes.fusion between hip-hop and metal, the songs manage to catch the ear on first listen, but the enthusiasm was short lived as linkin park definitely does nothing nouveau.un opus without ambition, therefore, that only fans of the genre will feel compelled to buy.
