blowgun years are now far and francis cabrel is back with new songs that we hear all day long on the airwaves: the bullfight, la cabane du pÃªcheur, saturday night on earth, i love you i t 'love i love you. if the content is bitter to the point that will benefit guignols to catalog the singer as an eternal pessimist, the music is soft and without any frills. as if all that touches cabrel turned into gold.
