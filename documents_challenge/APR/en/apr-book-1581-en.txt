the original idea - a synthesis of the men and battles that influnenc√© military strategy - was interesting, and early the author seems to reach its goal. but we realize then, including the part the twentieth century, it gives too many pages to be especially important battles in the history of france, not the art of war (cf. crecy, poitiers agincourt and illustrating all the same mistake french) at the expense of more recent conflicts (post wwii) ignored (why finish the game on "men" with kissinger and on the "battles" with the war yom kippur in october 1973?). too bad, because the book started out well, and seemed very interesting. it should however admit that this book despite its flaws remains instructive on some points, and can generate curiosity pushing the reader to go further on topics that he would not have thought otherwise. in this regard, the bibliographies at the end of each section contains only rarely more than two titles, which are mostly general textbooks, these lists may not lead the reader to other books about specific aspects the art of war he would discover a little more after reading an article. it remains unsatisfied.
