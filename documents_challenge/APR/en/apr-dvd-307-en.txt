firstly, i was glad finally the dvd release of both acclaimed concert! well i was disappointed, so disappointed, i would say that i'm bored! except for holiday atmosphere where there is at its peak, which is disappointing fact is that the recording of the concert is based on the stage effects on performance by madonna herself, almost no one close up! by cons, if you want to see the stands and the public, no problem. apart from that, i must admit that the sound is very good, cons by the image quality is not up to par, sometimes blurred (try to make some stops on image you'll see what i mean). on this, i advise you rather wait until the concert is broadcast on television, rather than rush you on this dvd
