that's good! versions and even some electro classics cordra group delight me. the perfect alchemy, i emitted a few doubts in the beginning? remixing songs rocks? is this possible? well, to my surprise this album is indeed divine. the "tosstaki" takes on new force through industrial sounds when "my stars" turns a lyrical breath.
