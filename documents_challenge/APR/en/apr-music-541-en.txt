i was particularly surprised to hear his voice for the first time in zapping one evening. it was launched by a sponsor, called gordon haskell, member of king krimson, at a concert where one can find a dvd, unless i am mistaken. what was my surprise to find no cd in trade, there are over 6 months. this limited edition release is a plus compared to the first draft, and i can only congratulate the result of work, looking very musically, and neat. nothing to say so, for a first approach the public, except maybe a little monotonous over the entire disk.
