for a comparative approach of the commercial geography, history, politics, anthropology of two major wine regions, the author highlights the profound duality of civilization from bordeaux and burgundy wine. nothing original in itself, certainly, but based on many academic works old and new, the test is full of information and knowledge, although we may deplore here and there interpretations clumsy or whimsical . the quality of writing adds to the overall quality, and we appreciate the lively style and tonic. in short, a book that covered both the synthesis and academic exercise in style, can irritate or delight, but still the best overview currently available on the subject.
