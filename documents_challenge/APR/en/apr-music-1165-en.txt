but no, it is not really great album. note, all the better if some whoop with this "forth", i even envy them. but i wanted to love this disc, but i might try, i can not. at least not completely ... unequal, it's really the word that comes when i try to express what makes me feel this new album from the verve. and yet, i'm pretty good audience when it comes to richard ashcroft, even i come to appreciate his solo albums, though far from perfect (in general). not totally seduced by the single "love is noise" but intrigued nonetheless, i embarked on this disc but frankly ... what happens? ... we do not just get bored here? ah yes, that's ... we get bored! here, i find it beautiful and captivating but the length, i give up. i note that the term psychedelic rock back often. if composition by psychedelic rock, means "piece of music a little soft but noisy at times, unnecessarily long and repetitive, which it does not happen much" then ok, i see a few songs ( "columbo" and "noise epic "at the top) that correspond to this definition. i confess i am not a fan of the first hour. i really enjoyed with the verve album "urban hymns" decried by some as too commercial by them. so perhaps i'm not the target of an album as "forth" which seems to revive the group's first period. still, with more songs in the tradition of "sit and wonder", "judas", "appalachian springs" (really beautiful, it), "valium skies" (despite the somewhat annoying that richard sings on the verse) and "i see houses" (which recalls the album "human conditions" by richard ashcroft), i enjoyed this disc more. in the end, despite a half songs quite successful, "forth" d really miss energy, panache and variety. old band's compositions like "bittersweet symphony", "sonnet," "the drugs do not work" or "velvet morning" remain out of reach, and i can not find here the beauty, strength and emotion to which i aspired.
