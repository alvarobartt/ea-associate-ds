this book ended the cycle of sainte-hermine (containing $ companions of jehu and $ $ white and blue $). the whole cycle was disappointed, it is the antipodes of $ count of monte cristo $ masterpiece, in my view, of dumas. the whole cycle is a historical novel of poor quality, where the characters are very stereotyped and caricatured. the gestures of nobility and chivalry are so outraged that they are ridiculous. there are finally some plot and many lengths. a tip of dumas action is described twice: once when it is lived, a second time when the hero tells his friends. on this third volume of the cycle, i was that the first hundred pages of the novel are summary box along with copy / paste of the two previous volumes [this from dumas, not the editor]. also in this volume, there are a lot of nonsense: fouche who takes under his wing hero, meeting surcouf with it ... in conclusion, i am happy to read this cycle to improve my knowledge of dumas, but i regret it so poor literary quality.
