nothing is more logical than his first album of covers, voulzy choose a directory dedicated to the summer and the sea since rockcollection until "the sun gives" voulzy has always been inspired by the sun, the ocean, islands. seventh wave has the merit of keeping the mind and gives us very quickly want to hum these tunes, which at one time, were part of our lives, our memories or our vacation. the arrangements are superb (as is always the case with voulzy) and all listen with real pleasure and even some nostalgia. the covers of smooth operator, oh lori, last kiss and light my fire are great. the duo voulzy / souchon, wink homage to simon &amp; garfunkel is great. however, i give only four stars because i liked a directory more daring, less beaten path.
