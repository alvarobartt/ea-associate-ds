shame on this project! sony does not care in the world with great disrespect! and how disrespectful to the artist (poor michael, rest in peace ...)! cd1 umpteenth compilation (if you can call it a compilation) and cd 2 crumbs (why a 2nd cd?)! course it will sell what damage they have always helped any and all can afford to excess now it's gone. always the same circus with this box and have to leave on good projects, well made with good content, what have we at the botched up projects with "bonus" balanced account better for it drop to full pockets. la palma in the demo "this is it" (2 versions): 2 versions??! the 2nd version is a version almost identical to the 1st except that a small, well-orchestrated ridicule by a few seconds was added to mine version "orchestra" loooooooooooool. i thought i had seen everything from them, but they arrive always impress me with their innovations in terms of scam. the only good point that still does not save all the 3 little demos, although the poem narrated by michael himself, and perhaps the booklet. get these demos you otherwise, but do not buy this cd (at least not at this price). find a product update this for 3 euros (including postage) you will make a case because it is not worth more!
