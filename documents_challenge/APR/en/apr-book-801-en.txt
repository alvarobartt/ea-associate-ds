i adore "the man who wanted to live his life" and "the catch ned allen. "a dangerous relationship" had already somewhat disappointed and it is also the case with this latest novel. the author's style is uneven and the translation into french is still not very good either (too literal translation - you can imagine without difficulty the structure of the sentence, the terms used in english). as history has it seemed to me smooth, too smooth, like the protagonist of this novel.
