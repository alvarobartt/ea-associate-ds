our very british guitarist moody blues (very very british) lived for ten years in southern france and recorded in italy in a charming small beach town called recco and do the best italian (they all look alike sophia and gina is well known ...) or just the sun but mister justin hayward splits a very good solo album than even the latest opus of the moodies ... "children of paradise" is as beautiful as "nights in white satin" and songs like "i heard it" "broken dream" "something to believe in" or "troubadour" are pop success stories and the beautiful "billy" evocation of the suicide of his brother win the accession ...
