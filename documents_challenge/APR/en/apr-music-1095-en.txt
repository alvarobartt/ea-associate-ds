i doubt buying this cd appeared 14 years after the official separation in 1989. we know that the cd of this type are often not very good ... surprise! the guitar sound is still saturated, may be more serious than in the 80s, the lyrics are always in the spirit bérus ... the packaging is cons outside the former. the digipack version has a rare quality, designs worked. a pretty nice package for a cd. it was a real pleasure to listen to this cd and listen to new pieces of bérus, 14 years later.
