we expected an album of grungy rock (pj harvey itself was well presented), there are really only 3-4 tracks of rock actually dirty, the rest are melancholy ballads like she knows so well do. for neophytes, a good summary of the works of miss: the rock has "rid of me" and pieces intimate way "to bring you my love." to the fans, good thought, but one would have expected something more rock.
