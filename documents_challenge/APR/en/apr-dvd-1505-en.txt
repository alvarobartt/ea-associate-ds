history too dark for my taste and frankly incoherent. julianne moore dies stupidly early in the film now, i thought his character had more scale: his name is there not headlining? also his death passes almost unnoticed ... clive owen is usually more inspired in his films. the story is cool, the characters are killed one after the other: no room for feelings .... as for the outcome: it is absurd (and how mexican women in red jacket led our "hero" to a boat??)! in short, very disappointed.
