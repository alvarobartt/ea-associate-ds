from the beginning i hooked on the series that i have known editions france loisirs. i waited between releases of each volume was very frustrating because i really liked the story that i found exciting. the end has fulfilled all my hope and i can not wait to read the next series of author! his style is something fluid and we surprised a certain time, to suffer with the characters literally! now that all the volumes are out, do not hesitate to embark on this original series!
