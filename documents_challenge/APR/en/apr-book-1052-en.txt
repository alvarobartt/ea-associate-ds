i just heard "ravel" by j. Ã©chenoz on france culture. it's appalling, you'd listen to the soundtrack of leo and popi. j. echenoz reduces his subject to a man without qualities, including the daily rest on the surface of things beyond the enterprise (unconscious?) lowering of ravel's genius, we can say that the author seems n ' have nothing to say about the extraordinary music of the composer, which precisely reflects a look alive, alert and interested in the world. perhaps because it does ravel can be described as a feather least mediocre.
