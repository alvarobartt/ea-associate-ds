the dead are still among us, they are watching, we think of them. "oh, and if it was a movie?" had to say, m. night shyamalan. just need a star (willis), a child (it moves always, children) and a final twist. but how long ago (1:45) with so little? with dialogues and flat and phoned the usual tricks (hallucinations, drawers that open by themselves, objects moving ...). i was bored when viewing indoors and ben is like ten years later on television. worse, i understood why some people have guessed all after five minutes when i had fallen into the trap the first time in film. in a similar type, prefer it a little ..... live:)
