the poison is really a great album. i suggest you buy it if not already done so. bullet is my favorite group: it is a metalcore band that combines the melodic voice of matt tuck and super solos mickael. album begins with a geniale intro, it is followed by 13 fabulous tracks then the outro which is regrettable that there are no more songs ...
