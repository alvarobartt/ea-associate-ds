superb film that ford.l of western history no longer has to tell (settlement account at the ok corral) but this is, in our opinion the best film ever made on the theme.rien superfluous, mounting absolutely superb (a nearly perfect), a black and white beautiful offering excellent contrast throughout the film and a lot of nostalgia punctuated by the very beautiful song my darling clementine short ... probably one of the top 10 western history ... a pure delight!
