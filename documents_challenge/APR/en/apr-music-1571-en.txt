i like metallica (well, until "black album") and also i love symphonic music. "symphonic &amp; metallica" was therefore a priori everything to seduce me. ... alas nothing to say about the sound, the compositions do not. but it is on the orchestration of the rub. arrangements conventional badly framed, talkative, uninspired, often inappropriate, leering too to film music and in the end very badly accompanying music of metallica. a real disappointment: the ultimate fusion has not taken place, far away need, but instead to play his partoche his side, so that one sometimes has the impression of listening to two discs at once and that group and orchestra hesitate. conclusion: for the fans first. for others, stick to good old albums. and if you want to explore symphonic music, treat yourself rather the 11th symphony by shostakovich, whose epic is a thousand miles of the agreements and without genius of michael kamen and his orchestra.
