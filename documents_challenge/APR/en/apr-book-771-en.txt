this is not a book that i read in normal times, i decided to buy it and read it because i saw the movie and i had loved. however, i was disappointed by the book. the author has a particular writing style. he mixes dialogue / narration, past / future, etc.. it does not quite describe the feelings of the characters ... in fact, there's something missing in this book.
