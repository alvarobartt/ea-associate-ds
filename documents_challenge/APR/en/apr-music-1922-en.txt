this album is a double cd for over 2 hours of happiness, and this is the last line! there touve all genres of music: country, jitter, jazz, arabic, and especially classical relax a max! the music is sublime, sometimes melancholic, but not fixed on the classic, but a lot of musical cultures existing ....( but not necessarily recent) only clean our ears to ... listen and listen without restraint. and i think it's a cd that should benefit from talking (like the rest of the range for that matter) for each cd contains various styles of music .... even for "non-fans" of this series, believe me, it's worth having.
