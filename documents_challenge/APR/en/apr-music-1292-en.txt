at the risk of even a scatterbrain, i offends me, i gives me the creeps to myself, once again, misled by taking for granted some glowing testimonials. how horrible and how poverty: the pouet-pouet is clubfoot and rhyme wobbly! not content to write badly, he does in all languages, history, probably, to internationalize the disappearance of his talent. the maker of wo and wo yep combines italian, english, spanish, french slang and the telegraph, to grunt and incoherent texts where vulgar rhyme means rehashing the same word, or even foreign words or onomatopoeia. the melodies borrowed from all kinds, especially the poor, trying unsuccessfully to harmonize logorrhea this polyglot. in short, christopher's birth - in pain? - a chore needy and pretentious i support intended to scare birds from my garden, attracted by the fruit less bitter and less laxatives.
