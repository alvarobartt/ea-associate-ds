for those wishing to read a witness (even fictionalized) the desire for children and medically assisted procreation must be warned: the narrator spends more than half the time talking because she wants to cheat his husband with a co-worker (i am-i am not), rather than his desire for a child with her husband ... so you're lost in what she wants to tell. i could not find a nice single second, it ends in a hurry, a little fish tail short, we remain unsatisfied. on the same subject, i would advise a thousand times more than i was expecting you, judith uyterlinde. much more authentic ...
