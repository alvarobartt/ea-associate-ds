how deep trouble! it starts with a song, slow, ultra-repetitive that it gets tired after 30 seconds. then "the wake-up bomb," allegedly piece rock but rather close to a bad side b. the track 3 takes us back immediately into boredom. even if this improves later (and yet, except some fragments of which two singles "e-bow" + "electrolite"), it runs various securities seem to have been written in a hurry to kill time (including "departure", the infamous instrumental "zither" and "so fast, so numb"). we excuse for sealing the atmosphere, but i really do not see anything on these rave reviews are based. maybe i become too old?? i advise you, however, you fall back on the best of equipped with the pretty blue moon in order to find the two major titles listed above.
