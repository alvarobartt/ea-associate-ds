a sequence that begins well in the beginning, a first story a bit long with a heroin annoying to repeat his pain. a second plot to rekindle interest in the novel and an end like a soufl√© which empties instantaneously. to conclude: a little long, delicate and little action. "temptation" reads quickly but does not want to read more. we find the same ingredients as in "fascination" but the world of high school, which was its charm. exactly the same ingredients but without flavor. my advice: stop at the 1st volume, go your way for the rest.
