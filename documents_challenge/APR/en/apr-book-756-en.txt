bubu is in love! ... but he does not know how to make the beautiful sheba falls for him too. his animal friends are advising him: like a roaring lion dance in a circle like a heron, her buttocks moving like a mandrill ... it does not really work and wondered if sheba boubou is not a little disturbed by the head! but while boubou too disappointed and misunderstood will go, the beautiful sheba catches him and makes him a big kiss. it's really cute and definitely that little bubu is really cute. small as 2 years will be affected for sure!
