before becoming the muse of ailments and being lost in some music a little too cerebral for my taste, björk took time to give us some good albums (first three). "post" (the latter of which she fired no fewer than six singles) has organized all the madness and freedom inspired by the icelandic. here, it escapes from all sides, moving walk ( "hyperballad"), aggressive industrial techno ( "army of me"), big band (the takeover "it's oh so quiet"), sensuality of "possibly maybe" magic of "cover björk ".... i will never like ordinary musicians. his dream world is unique. it therefore remains essential in the musical landscape.
