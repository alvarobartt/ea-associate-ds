what is maroon 5 if not a great group of pop-rock, complete with guitar riffs tinged funk and an album in which emerged a hit no doubt ( 'this love'). then of course, the album that follows is always a tricky and this time there is not no 'this love' to make up the sauce. however, besides the lack of memorable single, the album is more than up. in reality, maroon 5 even avoids the trap of wanting to do an encore, which had been a disaster. conversely, the group does not try at all costs to stand. the result is a seamless album in the vein of what the group does best and so true to his music. an honest and genuine album in fact. what, these days, it is well worth it awarded him an ear.
