hello, i collect comix / comics since the inception in 1969. then see the heroes in film is great. the x-men 3, his subject was a harbinger of great and i saw a movie sloppy and poor. the comic shows the problems of integration of heroes in society, their points of views and their struggles. here you just battle and badly filmed and more. an example: the scene of confrontation or the bridge of daylight and the arrival at the base or it is dark in minutes. this demonstrates the lack of seriousness on the assembly to focus on a baston no surprise as already seen and reviewed thousands of times. some loved it, not me at all, this film is to flee. i am among those who have this film as a collector, but x men 1 and 2 are by far preferred.
