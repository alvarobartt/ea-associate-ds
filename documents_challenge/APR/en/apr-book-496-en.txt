le figaro journalist, curator, jean s√©villia has specialized in recent years in the writing little books denouncing the politically correct atmosphere of our time. if the lessons of history had the merit to put into perspective some facts encumbered by our contemporary hysteria memorial, he passes by the side of his goal. neither history nor politics, this book looks mainly like a compilation of editorials in le figaro. those who do not detest this log book, those who appreciate there will learn nothing new. a good booklet dispensable.
