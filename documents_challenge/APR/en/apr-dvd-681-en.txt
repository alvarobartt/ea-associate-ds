this film by richard fleischer (barabbas ,...) shows us once again a work that deserves to attract a wide audience despite the weight of years of intrigue, a struggle between two brothers who are unaware of their blood relationship, uses shading to the nordic epic. the two heroes, kirk douglas and tony curtis, opposed in a struggle with no thank you (of course with a final duel in the dungeon of fort lalatte). in sum, an excellent entertainment, beautiful images of bravery, treachery and fighting for an adventure film that deserves to appear on dvd.
