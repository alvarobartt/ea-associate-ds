tell me! what happens there? did they really feel like doing an album. the only title that is worth listening to is the theme song "revisiting a spring" and "us". the french rap champions have lost their cohesion. iam represents a school of rappers who has fostered interest. an elite rapper dangerous! what happens there? listening to the album on dvd can see bruno coulais passing a criticism that the album is slow. he was right. akh / chill / sentenza was ignored. the album looks like sol invictus in 100 times less efficient, especially in black album (released later). it's hard to find words to explain this disappointment. but here are a few. before i think it must be a hypocrite to deny that the album is low ... very low! i'm sure even the band members do not listen to this album in their car. as producer-director at hotel invite iam issue record an album and revive the flame that once .... it's sad! no cohesion, shurk'n flow is low (just listen to his solo album "where i live" to see the difference we found he had spent much time on the cote d'azur holidays maybe ...) and he has the right and he deserves it very well but there is talk of a rap album should have been training ... "when we came back you were going?" the flood of akh is probably the worst (they do not understand what he said! his normal voice is so beautiful, why change it! i believe freeman has not lost strength. the problem is that the beats (largely chosen by akh will not vec style) the beats are powerless and obsolete and without appeal to the youth and even old age. i constantly replay the album in order to find the micro money! in closing , ami could easily beat their previous album with a little more tact, democracy, and practice active listening. to believe that they have invited meth and redman ... the album has been fantastic. is this last album that's the question! peace to the best hiphop group of all time.
