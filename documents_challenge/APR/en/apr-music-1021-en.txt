what first strikes here is the sound, very close, lively, friendly stamps, just as we did in the sixties. paco de lucia, offers a classical concerto played with his transcendent technique using attack free ropes, technical usual in flamenco. the spirit of romanticism and spain is fully respected here. a concerto of aranjuez unusual, exceptional.
