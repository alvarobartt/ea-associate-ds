i should have suspected something. on the jacket, not a comment on the novel itself, only on "cosmos incorporated", another novel by the author. i started and i suffer. 775 pages of dictation verbose and grandiloquent. no story, no rebound, no internal consistency. characters ranging from the absence and the unrealistic fullest. it is impossible to concentrate on anything, a character, a plot. each page is a new pain, a new spectrum of jam mystical gelatinous. if like me you can not interrupt a work begins, especially do not start it up!
