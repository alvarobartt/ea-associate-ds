one of my first manga, when i reread it i have lots of memory. in this third volume, miki will learn something about meiko going completely destabilized, which she thought was her best friend, ultimately it not know much about her. volume one more sympathetic, a manga that i advice to young girls, he is 8 volumes. this mangaka has made another series released in france but marmalade is the best, although i also much appreciated, mint no botura in 6 volumes.
