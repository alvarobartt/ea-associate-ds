everything has been said in previous reviews. i'd add that i am not at all a fan of this group. this is my neighborhood record store (yes, yes, it still exists!) who insisted that i take because i had bought several other mtv unplugged (clapton, young ... etc, all very good), and she has done well since this cd came immediately into my top 10, there may be a top 10, but only to emphasize the shock felt. a imperative in its own nightclub, for fans without a doubt, but especially for non-fans!
