it is a challenge to adapt a play to film because we are caught between the temptation to film part or deconstruct the script. the party has been taken to put the coin image, ie to keep the narrative theatrical but taking into account the advantage of cinema in the way of presenting images: traveling, big shots, static shots without words , accentuation of the game looks. it is a real achievement that adds communication of image over dialogue. scenes added at the beginning, end and interior shots add to the effectiveness of text in which all great players. the film poses the question of a successful life through destinies. from this perspective then, agnes jaoui and jean-pierre bacri are at ease. the dialogues are sharp, caustic, humorous, revealing the fragility of beings more than their facade of strength: a mother at home (wonderful zabou) cracking and wants to "make" also in the education of children and a wife of fame (agnes jaoui) who realizes she is a stooge who would, conversely, have children, a distinguished guest we never see who shines and makes rebound characters stifled brother the housewife who is playful and who will continue his bohemian life, ... all these characters meet and intersect, compete and fly themselves in attempting to evade the only question worth asking: what is a successful life? a montage dynamic, vibrant color, text perfect: a film that can serve as a topic of discussion at the mores family of the late twentieth century in a few years.
