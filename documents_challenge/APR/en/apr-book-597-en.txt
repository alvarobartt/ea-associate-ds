this book was for me a revelation, both in my relationship with my son, at the level of human relations at large. things so simple, they said "but how could i be so blind?". it teaches us to listen to others with empathy, and it also teaches us to listen, to reconnect with himself and his emotions, and especially not to be ashamed of his emotions!
