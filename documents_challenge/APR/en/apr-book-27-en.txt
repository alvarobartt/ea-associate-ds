an excellent vargas with his style so unique and so unusual that does not always reflect the reality and the real. the plot starts with a cemetery on a bizarre situation and overwhelms the reader not experienced in style fv: "the smell was fetid, the shocking scene, and adamsberg himself stiffened, residing at a distance behind his english colleague. cracked shoes, laces undone, emerged from the broken ankle, revealing the flesh and dark shades of white shins cut net "(page 26). the plot, leaving the unbridled imagination of the author is as usual far-fetched. adamsberg, between earth and heaven did not disappoint, gaining in thickness while lying in complex human situations. the other characters do not fade and continues to danglard adamsberg smile with his erudition as cumbersome effective. the trip to serbia rather eventful brings a little freshness. attention, writing and story by f. vargas can be confusing and choppy course of these stories put off some readers. others say it still used the same recipe and it takes no risk by not trying out a different kind. difficult to deny, but as a reader, i waited impatiently for this new vargas and i have found with pleasure the convoluted maze of his story.
