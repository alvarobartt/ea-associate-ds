a movie that eats all the racks, of "highlander" to "spiderman" through the world of video games. razalgul, ancient mage turned into "kung fu master" for the occasion, actor performing batman without charisma (he was recruited for the width of his torso), became gotham city's future and commissioner gordon unrecognizable small bespectacled fearful, sad and shriveled. a film tasteless and without an ounce of originality, ignoring the world of batman and just an excuse for an orgy of special effects damn bad, shot anyhow. the archetype of the film fashion , fiddled with a super famous actors who are only there to fill the lack of scenario (say the major players, it gives the impression that it is a great movie), pure marketing, horrifying banality and more is endless, a real ordeal.
