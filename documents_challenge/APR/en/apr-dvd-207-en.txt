why see this film? because it is simply great. a story a little crazy (admittedly), but very well told, filled with emotion, that will make you smile and cry. this movie is soaked nostalogie of an era ending, taking what it was worst (the division of germany) and it was best (ideology which some believed hard as iron.) everything begins with presentation of a family who are divided into the scenery of a city so divided it. it includes a mother who clings to the illusions of communism, because her husband, a disillusioned, leaving, leaving her with a son and a daughter. and throughout the film we find all the little details and objects that made quotidient of east germans. a breath of pure air half and half spawning. all punctuated by a stirring music made by the same composer as amelie poulain (y. tiersen.) magnitude is to see the attentions of the son towards the mother, seeing that the trapper becomes trapped, it is more than a wall collapses, sometimes it is better to cling to delusions ... again, a film that you should see once, then review and keep.
