copy of email sent today to kobafilms: hello, i am writing regarding your recent - and as we see the poor - dvd edition of "adventures of lagardere jean piat ... unfortunately, it is version of "cinema" lagard√®re you have the nerve to propose to the consumer: very truncated from the tv version more complete (6 episodes of 50 minutes = 300 minutes) it would obviously have been more helpful, friendly and logical we propose the integral of the series instead of this "light" version which includes a number of shortcuts to the punch: about 80 minutes at the door! a great opportunity missed your part to really enjoy the this beautiful nostalgic series: i hope word of mouth work faster and your sales will be negatively affected, negatively, of course ... i am both disappointed and angry: it was so complicated to do things correctly offering a full worthy of the name to meet the expectations of an audience necessarily composed largely nostalgic for this fine series, not movie version of his style "reader's digest"? i know this is a time of "zapping "excessive but anyway ... count on me to make this move - bad - new to all the fans on all the sites involved ...
