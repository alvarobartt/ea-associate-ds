born in 1970, the korean composer jeajoon ryu was formed in seoul and krakow, with penderecki. it has a connection with penderecki, even if like me you are ignorant, you would still be deducted after hearing a few bars of the sinfonia da requiem (2008) modeled on the last way (the worst ) polish composer. same strings, same gloomy atmosphere. ryu is a little penderecki what ries (i like) is to beethoven. only now, penderecki, beethoven is not ... i do not doubt the sincerity of jeajoon ryu, who wrote his work in memory of the hard work of his compatriots after the (if hidden) korean war (1950-1953 ). but the result is interesting without being sinister. that penderecki has called this impartially op. 11 a "masterpiece" does not alter the case. in addition, the violin concerto no. 1, even by the young virtuoso so-ock kim, set in england. somewhat difficult to appreciate the qualities of the latter in a work as little landmark. listen to the least good music from time to time. would that to remember how lucky we are that he may exist better.
