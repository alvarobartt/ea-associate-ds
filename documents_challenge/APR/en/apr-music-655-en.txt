superb album for this beautiful voice that gives the "goosebumps" (lara fabian has the worries to be ....) warm and full of nuances, the voice of chimene captivates us and we charm throughout this cd bravo for the interpretation of these texts and music to their property when messages. i hope a little more "swing" on the next album but the authors are likely to rush to write beautiful lyrics and beautiful music to our future star!
