avid j. irving, i admit i was quite disappointed with his latest novel. the story is flat and the characters ultimately hollow. j. irving displays even cultural gaps (or writing too fast and therefore not documented ?...): the chapter held in japan demonstrates his total ignorance of the country's rising sun: this contrasts cruelly with detailed descriptions of certain areas the united states. a novel therefore very uneven, a little sloppy in my opinion. a book for fans of john irving.
