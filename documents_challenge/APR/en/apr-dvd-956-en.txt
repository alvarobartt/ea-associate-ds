seeing all these glowing reviews, i bought the dvd and i regret it! what affectation! a film for pre-pubescent! sandra bullock (who still has over 40 years, although botox√©e elsewhere) who simpers as a girl of 15 years, the characters shallow and without interest, the blonde silicone service, we briefly was bored and was very nearly cut before the end. irrelevant!
