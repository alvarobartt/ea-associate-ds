for all the fans like me of jean auel and her heroine, ayla, the wait was long. but as i expected, i was not disappointed. of course, to understand everything, read the first 4 but this fifth volume allowed me to advance in the understanding of the daily and spiritual life of our ancestors while entertaining me. very good novel, very well documented. and once again, now, i expect one thing: more and soon i hope.
