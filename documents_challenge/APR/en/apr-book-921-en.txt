after i forced to read the first 4 chapters of this book (offered by my mother ....), i threw in the towel .... how can they write so many pages to say nothing at all? the problem is that miss loana is intended as a reflection of today's youth, and many amalgam was quickly done. but how many people really find themselves in this nonsense, this pale copy of cosette, who wants us to believe she does not understand what is happening, it is not manipulated? ... finally it all that it is unfortunate to be associated with such scams by purchasing this book ....
