half the book is devoted to the history of bread (you can find it all on the internet and it has nothing to do with eric kayser). the famous sourdough recipe takes about 8 fluid lines (not a single picture of the different and steps to get the result). all proceeds breads have an identical text (only a few ingredients vary: 5g to 10g yeast or yeast) alone on a stage that is the primary shaping ( "shaping the ball-shaped rod "no photos). in summary this book provides less information than can be found on the internet elsewhere.
