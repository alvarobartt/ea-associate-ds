cecilia bartoli is an excellent singer with enormous potential. but this disc is not up to the previous, the cover is arranged, the songs sometimes quelquonques and the singer does not use her voice as she knows so well done normally. it's too vocal demonstration, and did not give the emotion she has given before.
