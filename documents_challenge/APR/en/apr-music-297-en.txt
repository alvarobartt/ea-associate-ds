in full wave punk band that has dared to recall the origins of rock: blues and country. much of the success comes the talented guitarist mark knopfler (laid back to jj cale, volume control). he has never played as well. it is their first album but it gives an amazing impression of maturity. there are 2 tubes sultans of swing (and his huge solo guitar hero) and down to the waterline, but this disc is full of high quality securities often forgotten. setting me up, smooth rock shuffle though fast, is a dynamic style that would have benefited from being retained longer by the group. the resemblance is indeed striking southbound again. in the gallery is the best and most representative of the album. the guitar is broken down all sauces. at the time their soft ballads had a lifetime drinking and still sounded more authentic (wild west end). we were really far from calling elvis at the time.
