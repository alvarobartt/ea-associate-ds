best rock album of all time, the french response to sgt pepper. the album that everyone will agree. the who, doors, led zep, velvet have finally found their masters. a subtle blend of "pets sounds", the "piper" of pink floyd (with lyrics worthy of a great syd barrett night) and "who's next", the 3rd installment in kyo itself as the album's final rock (unless a "300 naked damage" or "kyo live at the royal albert hall"). no i'm joking of course is still very bad, i advise fans kyo begin to listen anything, there's so much better elsewhere.
