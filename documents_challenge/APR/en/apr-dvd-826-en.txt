attention turnip cosmic! true, "impressive" (and it starts very hard, from the opening sequence) is quite well filmed and quite fitted, there's a rebound every 35 seconds (the brainstorming writers have so well they were told they were going to do everything) ... it is also a fabulous collection of replicas that kill ( "at 8000 meters, you're not dying ... you're dead!", said with the air that goes), actors in mummers wish, with a "very wicked wicked" and "nice very nice" ... and it is mainly a "realism" confusing (there's only look at how these expensive players move where they should be at 8000 meters), to weep with laughter any amateur mountain or mountaineering has already exceeded 3,000 meters in altitude or having ever seen a documentary on the himalayas. a book on long winter evenings, when the zygomatic really need work. and if you take this thing seriously ... uh ... my belief is that you still believe in santa claus!
