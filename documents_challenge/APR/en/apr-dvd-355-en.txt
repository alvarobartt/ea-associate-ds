only 8 episodes, how to hold? but i must admit that these are 8 episodes of high quality .... this is happening a lot: carrie meets a new girlfriend writer, the great love charlotte but shhh ... .! until the season 6, the last unfortunately, with many twists and turns ... i am impatient to know the end!
