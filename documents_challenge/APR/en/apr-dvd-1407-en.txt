heavy, long ..... missing something denouement to make this movie taking. and the acting is not perfect ... it speaks, ca says ... a story driven by a little dryer! in short, it looks ok ... goin ca. it's going ok, what else after? in short, it does take us nowhere really. all is not bad ... but it is still far from being simply good.
