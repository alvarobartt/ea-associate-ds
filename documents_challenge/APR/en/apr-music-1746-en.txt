as much i enjoyed the first part of pop times 80 years by this group, 11 years ago, much to the latter, i find there is abuse. firstly, we can ask the whether it was wise to give cover. finally, if this had been done properly, it would probably not say anything. second, and most importantly, it is a massacre! alex krull sings off on most titles and interpretations are downright pompous. we regret even the original versions. there is not one to catch another (except perhaps the resumption of face, and again ... saying that it justifies the single star). no, it's just anything. one wonders the interest of such a disk. the group was ridiculed. add to that the scope of the cover tease to sell up ... good advice, go your way!
