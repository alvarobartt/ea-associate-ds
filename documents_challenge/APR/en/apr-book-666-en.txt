without subtlety or strength, colette builds his novel around a theme addressed a thousand times, and almost worn out, without making any particular. there is nothing bad in this book, but we have the sad impression of having already read before you even finish it. it can be defined only by what is not: it lacks anything that would make it a unique and interesting novel.
