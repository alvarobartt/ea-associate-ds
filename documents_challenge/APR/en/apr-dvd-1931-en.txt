sorry seems to be the only one not to have found this film worthy of 10 oscars "(at least) but overall, i think benoit pooelvorde was not at his best and that the history was not really convincing. the difficulty with scenes enchainent not really offer the viewer any continuity, replicas of the actors are too free or prefabricated and behaviors of people in general are not very realistic. i much prefer the large "is coming near you" or even the "walkers". really disappointing.
