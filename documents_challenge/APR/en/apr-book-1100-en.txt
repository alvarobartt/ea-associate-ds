how boring! this book tells nothing. i do not understand its success, the style is bland, there is no story: the whys and hows of the apocalypse is not reported. it follows a father and son in their attempt to survive but there's nothing else to share it. in fact, the summary on the back cover is the substance of the book, the rest is unfolding this narrative starting point. what a disappointment!
