wonderful, is particularly on this album that gainsbourg is the summit of his art. the arrangements are superb and the lyrics swing between desperate love and madness. technically, the mixing time is a marvel, the engineers used to analog are otherwise better than that, at present, do swear by digital (yuck!). even the media itself (180 g vinyl) is superb. the disc is heavy and rigid. it does not vibrate like 90g and the route of the path is clear. the dynamic compression is controlled at the highest point. fans of serge must obtain if they want to hear a real sound!
