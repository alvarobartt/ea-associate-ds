largo winch is for me the surprise of this year-end 2008 (in film) and 2009 to output the blu ray. i was not expecting a film as good as that. the blu-ray provides even more depth to the film by the color quality of beauty and contrasts of light. very diversifying both its history and places visited actors also did not lack quality. a special mention to the music in perfect harmony with the film. largo winch carries you very far! finally an adjustment to the height bravo! to have absolutely.
