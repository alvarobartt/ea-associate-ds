having bought the book "like lions" of mr. dominique lormier i bought it to have another view. i am very disappointed with this book for the following reasons: 1) the style is that of a journalist who flits and do not go after things. we go from a theater of operation to another along day by day fighting, but it does not follow the thread of a battle over several days. it is therefore difficult to understand. 2) many facts are not substantiated. the pages on helen doors are bizarre. the author persists in it, one would think worse than hitler and almost responsible for the direction to stop the fighting. some research on the net show very divergent opinions. this was dependent is done without real justification. 3) the following fighting is very difficult due to lack of maps. the author advises us to do as the wehrmacht and to get a michelin map. it's a fair bit! 4) finally defense technology is nonexistent. the very interesting information on the tanks or other somua found at mr. lormier on anti-tank guns, etc. are ignored here superbly. no details on aviation, the air battle, no details on the fighting with italy, nothing about the fighting in saumur. the book is very incomplete. 5) finally, after reading it is impossible to say how the french and german armies were organized: staffing ratio of tanks and other weapons for example. if the style is pleasant, we remain fully on hungry.
