in his line of animated films, madagascar looked a little out of the lot and the trailer was enticing ... well what a disappointment! the story is completely flat, however it is almost nonexistent. i did not even laugh once. really disappointing. they can say what you want, this cartoon is without any flavor! in summary: many hay not much.
