houellebecq could be about all this "one of those philosophical essays" to succeed and not read that often, but instead of sinking into an easy intellectual he built an entire ontological reflection through intertwined destinies of two half - brothers, a novel with autobiographical false airs. it may be taken aback upon reading this novel, for its cornerstone (cleverly constructed) is only the end, we go through the passage of many patterns "disturbing" before accessing it. but what joy in the end! read ... especially the end.
