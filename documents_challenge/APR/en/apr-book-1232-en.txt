an interesting beginning, a theme and writing touching. this woman, in love with a married man seeking to fill the gap which fills when her lover leaves her. but soon, one gets the impression of turning around, returning constantly to the same things. it lacks a flame in writing in history, who would carry the reader. fortunately the book is fairly short, the final note of hope helps not to let the vain discourse. read as a first novel just completed.
