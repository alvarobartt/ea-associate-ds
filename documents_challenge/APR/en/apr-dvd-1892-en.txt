if you liked samaria or ile, which are the films of kim ki duk which resemble them most, we should appreciate what time, which did not echo and public criticism deserved . the idea is brilliant in its simplicity: a woman who fears seeing his friends unravel elect to change the face to win back her lover. it will of course fight against the memory of the loved one disappeared (and cons of competition). the staging is elegant and strong: how many filmmakers could shoot without pathos this incredible story? how to manage a direction of actors as brilliant? know how both write their stories in places and distinctive spaces? this film does not innovate kim: we can blame him or declare that the real authors reproduce quite logically the same grounds and take a pleasure to variations on a theme.
