this book presents the vpn, with explanations to understand what it is and what is the point both in terms of safety and cost of implementation and operation. it also shows all the aspects that need be taken into account in choosing such a solution. that said, this book does not meet my expectations because i was trying to establish a vpn and this book provides no practical information for creating such a system . in conclusion, it is ideal to know the vpn but little interest in the development and technical implementation of such a system.
