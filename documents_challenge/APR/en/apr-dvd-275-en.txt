let us not be fooled! this is not because we find the same actor and featured the same director in qu'incassable sixth sense is the same level! no, nothing to see! this film is so bland led to a slow or no, with endless scenes ... mr. shyamalan, no need to explain everything for hours, the audience is not stupid! in short, i struggled to stay until the end of the film. fortunately the fall was somewhat interesting, but this film is to rank among the hollywood big disappointment! but the idea was not bad, but how to turn! fortunately i saw sixth sense after the surprise came after the big disappointment. so, do you have that are big fans of bruce willis and samuel jackson lee.
