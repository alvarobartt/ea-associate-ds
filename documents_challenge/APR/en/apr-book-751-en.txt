renewal of the legend of king arthur, leaving the lion's share to women and especially to morgan, this saga is a magnificent interpretation by marion zimmer bradley who has documented many of the celtic legends. but beware! she made inquiries of members of movements associated with the new druidism (current born in the 19th and "reinventing" druidism), then later veracity of ancient cults, this is not a reference. any takers original versions, if you can read english, you no more than pleasure, because the french translator was allowed to make cuts in the text and the original version has many more references to breton and welsh legends, and characters are expanded. the vo is a real treat!
