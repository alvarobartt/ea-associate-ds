a beautiful story in a little known period of italian unity (intervention of garibaldi in sicily); atmosphere typical of the epic film of visconti: the end of an era. some have criticized that the ball scene has a place too long in this movie, i found, however, we do not get tired, so much as it is observed and so beautifully illustrated. the character of "cheetah" is beautifully interpreted, j'aimme just under the game alain delon nen leading man; about claudia cardinale, i find it very beautiful, but a little vulgar, which suits his role. overall, a great evening!
