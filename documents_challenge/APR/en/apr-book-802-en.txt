before the release long-awaited by many fans of the first episode of the trilogy the lord of the rings in december, i wanted to offer me a little trip into the fantasy world created by this great man, john ronald reuel tolkien. having already read the lord of the rings, which i intend to read later, it was natural that i turned toward the silmarillion to start this epic literature.
