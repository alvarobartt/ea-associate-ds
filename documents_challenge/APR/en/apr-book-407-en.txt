the nice gibran spouting platitudes kind in flowery language. i recognize that this book made me wonder how such a collection of platitudes leveled conclusively could have such success? i liken the success of the prophet to that of sudoku. basically, gibran was to philosophy and religion that sudoku is the mathematical manipulation and elegant formal concepts whose meaning has been evacuated. the speech is so simplistic as to be almost reduced to its pure form. it is enlightening to learn that gibran was also a painter in his spare time he practices a purely aesthetic poetry. i guess it appeals to superficial minds who are unable, or unwilling, to go beyond appearance, much like a child whose favorite word is the word "chocolate". unfortunately he does not pronounce the word love to talk about love. recommended for fans of sweet talk and images of epinal - the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
