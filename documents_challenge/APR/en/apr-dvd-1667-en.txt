i am very disappointed. never done african dance, i was very motivated by this dvd. the biggest problem is the teacher who told us such a movement of the left arm while for us who watch it is right and vice versa. this is the second time i try and i just stopped because it annoys me. i think the movements are explained to quickly and you're doing as you can is really galley ms. it's pretty demotivating. in addition, the frames are not coordinated with the movements she announces. she tells us to make a movement on foot and is framed on the bust of the dancers so you can not copy or correct. really very, very disappointed. i would not recommend it for beginners or semi-beginners
