i really appreciated the advice, style and spirit of the book. i followed the system speed and am now in good shape regime. i lost 7 pounds in 2 Â½ months without ever being hungry and not feel "the system". i recommend it expressly and continues to offer it to my friends who want to lose weight "intelligently"
