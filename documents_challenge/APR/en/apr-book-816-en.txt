when we think of all the french authors, these good french authors, we must not forget the good old peter, it is so hard, and this book is further proof. the story of el cid is a bit like those of racine ... a man must choose between love and honor (or remain faithful to avenge his father) and this gives rise to the famous: "oh oh rage oh despair vieilleisse enemy, so i've lived so long ..." i'm sure you know the rest if not read this classic soon! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nelly
