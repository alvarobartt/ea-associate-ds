i have this book since its twelfth edition, we are the 16th and that it is better essential, it must have been, it comforts us, heals us, save us. it is the book that homeopathy should have. accurate, easy to understand, complete (as far as i can judge) it is of all our trips and even cares for the animals of the family. of course he must know what we suffer for not making mistakes, but with a little attention and the sometimes-professional help, you come to heal prsque all emergencies. if so, homeopathy treats as emergencies. i did buy my whole family and many friends around us.
