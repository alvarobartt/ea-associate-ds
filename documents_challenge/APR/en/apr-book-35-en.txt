i really do not see what interest in this book - which i only read the "good stories" (sic) and leaf through while waiting for my plane - and am saddened that it attracts such an energy in the critical comments the other two reviewers. i note that the reviews of the "beautiful" and "real" books, culture bearers and message of hope, do not attract as much energy. above all, i am amazed to see that "foo" is ranked no. 204 in the hit parade of sales! could you measure the intellectual decline of our country sales figures of such products, the fantasies of heterosexuals' an old beau who wants to play the young adventures of gay pedophiles and minister of culture, through the pollution issue by attali, bhl, kouchner and other showmen not funny? it is to be believed. for me, going into a bookstore has always been a source of healing: it is becoming a source of asphyxiation.
