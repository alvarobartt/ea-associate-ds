one little-considered this album as the first disc emocore, at least these authors were the first to qualify as such, and emotion is discussed, the core side for the explosion of guitars, as sunny day real estate that is, calm and storm. i must say that this album requires some time to be tamed, at first listen it's hard to really differentiate all the pieces apart pheurton skeurton is a title panio very different from the rest, the album is very dark and the vocals of jeremy enigk very special and very airy. but above all do not get discouraged because it plays throughout the album that you will discover its secrets and it contains small beads, once back inside is only happiness and emotion. this disc is therefore recommended to anyone interested in the first wave of emo mid 90's and of course the fan of indie-rock
