nothing to say about this album, songs are very diverse and worked (the moving hurt, the torrid nasty naughty boy, the crazy candyman, phonograph so the sound of i got trouble, and so on and best), the style "oldies" of certain songs hooked me from the first listen, his voice still carried both ... this album is really to explore, dare to go beyond the reputation "bimbo core" of the singer.
