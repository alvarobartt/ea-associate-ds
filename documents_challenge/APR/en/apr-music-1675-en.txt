after 2 excellent albums (episode and visions) and two less good (destiny and infinite), as modeled in the carbon paper (in less inspired) on the two pre-cited strato had to change. reduce the tempo, and scrapers to the orchestrations package was the solution. he's the least we can say is they did not choose the right one! it seems difficult for some groups to renew, and i welcome in general take risk, but frankly there is a failure. the scrapers are totally submerged by the orchestrations, the songs are highly predictable (or ultra borrowed from previous games as it is) and everything is based on smoke and mirrors: a sound overwhelming and real instruments behind. only "soul of a vagabond" pulls out of the game, the rest is boring: stratofortress sounds already heard 10 times, eagleheart was mixed without guitars, find your own voice is stressful as the song goes high ( moreover, the poor timo can not even be fair when it is a recording studio) papillon, uh ... good short, do not fire on the ambulance, it is a failure, and part 2 do not go up the level. strato have been a flash in the pan and it was good to enjoy it. now place the young!
