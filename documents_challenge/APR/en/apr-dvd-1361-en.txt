this is not the kind of movie to watch with your step-mother who does nothing when the action gets a bit complicated as soon as there is a flashback: the film is because of this and it must cling. a moment of inattention and you can start from the beginning. at the beginning we have the impression that one is left to another for 'men of duty "with nicholson and demi moore, but there much difference between the two scenarios between an episode of chapi-chapo and the history of mankind. so i do not say anything about the story, from a simple beginning, we have ten versions of the same drama, and hold you to say, nothing is certain and everything can be questioned. and of course when it's finished, everything is folded and the two principal actors say goodbye, boom, everything collapses and it starts all over again. then a second time. then a third. then a fourth. etc., until there is nothing that we knew who did take the road. breathtaking. you'll love it.
