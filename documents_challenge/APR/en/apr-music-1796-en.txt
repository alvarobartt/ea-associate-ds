when this disc came out, herv√© picart, "best", had praised. i had bought then, trusting the good taste of the critic. i immediately hated. just pop songs with a bland affigeante, with phil collins even more vapid than usual, it said. com to post this. so i listened to it again "invisible touch" and my opinion has not changed. only 1 piece can be saved from the wreck: "brazilian". for the rest .... i'm told that the album came out after was even worse, i do not know i've never listened, but it seems to me difficult to do worse than this bland soup
