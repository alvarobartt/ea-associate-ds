listening to the voices and securities offered by alison sudol, you have only one desire: to drop what you do, park at the roadside, you put in a chair and take ... time to really listen to this artist. this air, soaring, hypnotic, restful, enchanting, melancholic ... that's what i felt in listening and seeing "live" with the title "ranger" ... and "almost lover" is a little gem, which only confirmed my first impression ... there are few artists who can transport you into their world like that.
