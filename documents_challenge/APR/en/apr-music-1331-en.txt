i remember clearly the release of their debut album, `employment ', and me thinking," damn, what combination of originality and energy! ". well, this remark is proved for the second and now third opus. `off their heads' is a pleasure to listen as he gives the tone to undertake anything. the warm voice of ricky wilson adapts to all types, or by pushing the walls or by being affectionate. `never miss a beat 'is proof that the group is not running out of juice if the demonstration was required. `can not say what i mean ',` you want history' is also confirmed. the group has developed a sound characteristic that each of them sign it. there is no doubt about the success of this album. a note on the last song, `remember you're a girl 'sung by drummer nick hodgson as he did for the previous album. overall, if we must have a critical sense, `off their heads' pulls can be a bit below their previous creations with some pieces just 'the economy' but overall, the album deserves much your investment .
