what a disappointment! i loved the book reads a draft of the plot is so involved. but then the movie ... what turnip! this is really an adaptation botched and failed. no suspense, all indices are released too early and fall like heavy biscuits in your bowl of cafe au lait. one has the impression that jean reno has already read the book and all these disturbing events that occur do to him no surprise: "elementary, my dear sidekick, the culprit is ... easy, c ' is written in the script! "my advice: buy the book, read it and if you do not mind you laugh then watch the movie!
