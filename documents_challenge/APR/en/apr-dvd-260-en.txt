casino is not just a gangster movie, the movie gangster par excellence. backed by exceptional actors (de niro delivers here his last good performance and joe pesci shows it can be terribly impressive scabby little crazy), the story is involved, rich and complex and involves the viewer in a descent into hell to both sickening and hypnotizing. martin scorsese directs the film admirably, cleverly chaining intimate scenes and scene of crowds to arrive at a final whirlwind of emotions that leaves the viewer breathless, flushed. needless to fight, we can not resist. this prestigious publication is a further argument, since it includes bonus really interesting and not just trailers as is too often the case.
