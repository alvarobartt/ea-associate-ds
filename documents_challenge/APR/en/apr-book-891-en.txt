is a book that i disliked a priori because it was too well known, he too felt the "college". why have i wanted to read it? to not die idiot no doubt, and i was very inspired! it is a novel largely to its reputation: firstly because it is in the skin of the young main character and we identify with it completely, we feel the same fears that when it is face of danger, when it includes the plot is going on behind his back. then, because this novel has all the ingredients that make you dream: the pirates (and no junk!), an island (almost) abandoned, a hidden treasure, a map to find and dangers at every step ... exciting reading!
