2008 the year of thrash! testament, death angel, forbidden paradox ... even remakes concerts. in short, the drive that concerns us here is made up of old timers, even if they have been very few prolific. the technical level is excellent, the writing is intelligent. from old school thrash in mind, with lots of fast tempos, but not corny at all. good melodies, a singer a little small but not unpleasant, excellent solos (it sounds like blind guardian sometimes), everything you need for proper installment in this style. a hair better than collision course, his predecessor this cd is definitely worth the cost, especially as albums of thrash, it does not reach between the teeth every day ...
