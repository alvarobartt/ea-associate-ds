korn, c group of neo par excellence, they have invented a style and they do not hide (follow the leader "follow the leader") and yeah, c thanks to them that there has been deftones, coal chamber, limp bizkit and many other groups. this album is exellent, impossible to choose between him and the "life is peachy" (bought eyes closed). c excellent musical level. fieldy imposes its style with its slap bass playing, his influence c hip hop group (solo album stream: fieldy's dream) both guitarists play together wonderfully with their famous 7-string guitar, and mr. davis, a style single depressive between singing and song bourrin we necessarily charmed by this album. but this is true only for the first two releases because after it gets harder. korn went on.
