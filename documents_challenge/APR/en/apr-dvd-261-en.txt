i put five stars without problem (even entire milky way looks like rockin) to the epic mafia, a kind of absolute film (production, script interpretation, sets, bo, everything is nickel-chromium), if there was not a small detail: the last quarter of an hour is such a surge of violence (this film takes a perverse pleasure to "magnify" the pretext of "sticking to reality") that becomes irregardable unbearable. there are also the services "100% actor's studio" trio de niro / pesci / stone and "f ** king" charged to the gun (we must keep a record here). what a mess!
