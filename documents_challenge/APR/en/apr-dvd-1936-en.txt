from carpenter, truth, or at least one facet of this great relay. kitch at will, abusive, exaggeration, awesome! carpenter even managed to self-parody! this film is clearly found more side "series b kitch" ( "big trouble in little china", "escape from ny", "escape from la") director so fond that the side " frightening "to some of these films (" the thing "," in the mouth of madness "), but make no mistake it's all spit carpenter. in the film the cinema, many people had found that no, i never understand these people, they would see a carpenter, not an almodovar! in short, the fans will love this dvd, the others will wonder why the director to ruin as many films! for my part, i chose my side, i love kitschy western hero with rakes, against a background of noisy metal!
