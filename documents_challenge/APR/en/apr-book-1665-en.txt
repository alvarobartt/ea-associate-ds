i looked for info on using baking soda. i have found plenty on the internet. therefore, i thought it would be nice to have a little book that would summarize the whole. but it is frankly useless you pay the book to learn nothing more than what you find on the internet and even less, especially less elsewhere. i think this book is useless. it does not even condenses what we can learn on the internet. no need to buy this book, it does nothing, i am frankly disappointed.
