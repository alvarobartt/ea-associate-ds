it seems that this novel science-fiction requires a concentration on reading, what i have not managed to do. surely a good sf novel, but i found it too "heavy". i was asked to sum up the book i never make it. perhaps with a second reading. my faith if one day i am really motivated. but i think mostly it's not my kind of sf, lacks a bit of concrete.
