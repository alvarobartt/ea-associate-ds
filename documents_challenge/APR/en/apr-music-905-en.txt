frankly i do not really understand this craze for avril lavigne. it is different from britney and christina does not a genius so far ... this disc vaguely resembles a pale copy of alanis morissette mixed with sheryl crow. and when you mix pure sound, the result is not necessarily as good. miss lavigne will play the rebellious, one might think that with his scratches and his nickname is a street look gifted. it is quite otherwise. finally when one wants to make the anti britney we just always make it more commercial.
