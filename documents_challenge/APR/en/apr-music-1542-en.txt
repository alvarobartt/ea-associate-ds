pathetic, deplorable and intolerable. in short, no shortage of adjectives to deplore the revocation of this album. how a group like metallica could release an album like this. the sound is archi-zero, the battery can, the bass is soft, and the solos are not there. aaaah! it is far time master of puppets or the black album. it's a shame this album. why a star, then? because after all, is metallica, and should not deny their great time in the late 80s and early 90s.
