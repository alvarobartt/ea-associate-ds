this film is both funny and touching emotional cynical. this is the story of two friends who start a week on the road of wines from california, one to bury his bachelor life and another to be forgetting her divorce. and during this week everything is questioned. they start to forget a little but their lives to catch up. this is an extremely touching it with a touch of cynicism. this is an installment in the lives of two men but the whole is remarkably well tied to the end leaves us a hint of optimism. a must see.
