silly turnip. a gangster movie where nothing happens, where it is bathed in endless dialogue bordering on the irrelevant blabla. the crooks are suddenly psychology! silly camera where the end is predictable. silly, from beginning to end. i'm still looking - to say nothing of genius - the ability of tarantino. at around carefully.
