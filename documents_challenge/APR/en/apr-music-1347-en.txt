the best of vangelis is again very interesting. after treatment for 7 years non-stop classical music, i started listening to vangelis, not without apprehension. what was i thinking of those discs that i loved so much after such a long break? surprise! always good! and even a lot! first of all for the wonderful without constant repetition of his vangelis for his miraculous discoveries of sounds sometimes strange, sometimes spellbinding. again, the music of vangelis reasons are very simple but operated until the end. we could reprochr this music to be repetitive (to the unknown man, longuet enough), but it is precisely the whole point of it. one wonders how the composer developed his movement from a small ground. and often, we are very surprised. this best of includes some major pieces like the demonic spiral, haunting until saturation, ending in chaos tetanic sound. i said in a previous review that i thought alpha (beautiful) and so long ago, so clear (enchanting). ballad, completing this program, plays the card of monotony, with synthetic voices punctuating a march to the "zombie" by romero (i saw this music in his films). sword of orion and a seemingly endless way, despite the extreme brevity of the two parts, which highlights a paradox of the music of vangelis: while ballad evokes a frozen moment and seems long, the shorter pieces are supposed to represent the eternity. fascinating anyway!
