"babylon babies" is in my humble opinion the best novel by dantec. unfortunately, the film that drew kassovitz is only a bland caricature. where the characters in the book were dense, vibrating with emotion and had a coherent psychology, we are here with creatures without relief and without interiority in which i was unable to project myself. problem scenario? maybe! casting? certainly! most actors, vin diesel in lambert wilson via michelle yeoh, singularly lacking in conviction. bringing talents from around the world is always a perilous exercise. sometimes it works and he is born an interesting alchemy. alas, in this case, it follows that a patchwork of unconvincing performances. in his defense, he must recognize that the production of this film was weighed down by lots of technical and artistic problems that have not have the convenience of the director and actors. but it remains an excuse for the shooting may have been tormented by great works. see "apocalypse now" "ultimately, i came out of this sorry experience, both for kassovitz, whose" career "file a decidedly bad way and dantec whose fictional universe deserves to be at the screen translation happier. on the whole, "the red siren" by olivier megaton, who now dates a few years, had more class, a much greater aesthetic coherence and especially narrative punch that corresponded admirably to the frenetic phrasing dantec. all this with a budget far more modest than that of "babylon ad" "it is hoped that the adaptation of the long-promised" roots of evil ", if it is finally the day will again do justice to the one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary french literature.
