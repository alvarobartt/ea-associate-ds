each volume of this anthology can listen to four of the best representatives of the blues of the windy city 70s/80s: each has recorded four tracks, which can actually discover and then go further if we are seduced. some of these musciens have become "stars" of the chicago blues (magic slim eg), others have returned to obscurity, but almost all are coming here in their best light, by producing competent and careful bruce iglauer. titles of jimmy johnson, carey bell, lonnie brooks, luther johnson, andrew brown, in particular, are really beautiful and are among the best in modern blues. but nothing is insignificant in this fine series, which is a must for any fan of contemporary blues.
