we read and reread it with pleasure this book is one of the greatest works of political science and sociology ever written. a power analysis combined the writing talents of the author. one can only admire the incredible gift of visionary tocqueville more than a century in advance provides at once the predominance of democracy, the advent of russian and american power, equal conditions and the risk of despotism that it entails. "democracy in america" also learned a lot about american society at the time, the cruel removal of indian mentality of american adventurer, nature and structure of laws. but we can blame tocqueville to make too many generalizations from the study of a single case, the united states. it existed in his time another democracy, switzerland, it was interesting that tocqueville could also study the basis of his thoughts would have been wider. "democracy in america" is nevertheless an outstanding book of reflection, extremely rewarding.
