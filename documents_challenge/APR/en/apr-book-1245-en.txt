i discovered this book with great pleasure. very friendly, the recipes are clear and easy to perform and the work is simplified if we follow good advice from the author. we spend great moments of happiness in my kitchen with my three little children, yes! i am a grandma, this book is addressed not only for moms! they want everything and capucine as wins and everyone has already made his choice of recipes. good work and lots of fun in prespective!
