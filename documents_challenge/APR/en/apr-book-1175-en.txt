finkelstein / silberman, authors of this book, give a version without god in the history of the holy scriptures in which a group of the vii century revisionists have invented a story made from scratch on the recent history of their people. the authors contradict themselves by stating that such illiterate people have maintained a strong oral tradition of their past, but at the same time have believed in this invention. how to give credence to such theories when the oral traditions of that people have endured for many centuries? we said in that book the bible is a propaganda document, which makes it even more extraordinary the idea that the scribes of the bible would be misled about the facts of recent history, but were fairly predicted the survival of an insignificant group of hebrews in the midst of these great empires that surrounded them. my recommendation: do not buy and do not read this book. buy the book instead of jean bottero: the birth of god.
