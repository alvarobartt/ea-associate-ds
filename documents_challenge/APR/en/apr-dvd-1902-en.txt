the first film, 3 men and a basket was one of the most surprising success. the comedy was certainly a charm (on) but when one sees today this album, one conclusion is obvious, the film took a shot vieux.18 years later we shall give one layer (if i dare say ).... perhaps the director thought her, she would again reach a wide audience and fill the boxes. lack of this bowl was not the case and the film was nicely embossed box office. blame it on what? directed unimaginative, winded scenario, players have little incentive, some say it all. ben is not all that good for a number 3.
