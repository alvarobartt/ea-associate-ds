this film is franco-german recovery full and faithful murnau film of the same name almost. changes are sometimes strange, as linversion, mina and lucy, and jonathan's wife is lucy. it is unclear whether it is in bremen and amsterdam. jimagine but it has little dimportance. it incorporates the idea of hosting the plague, but with increased morbidity as the parade of coffins and especially the last supper, last supper, the survivors still soffrent on the main square in the sun. but the film ends in a first step as in murnau with lucy sacrificing himself to save her community and she managed to smoothly hold nosferatu in his arms until whoop. but she died here. the film then added a layer with a van helsing who drives a stake through the heart of dracula to end forever but it will be immediately arrested for murder and a trial is promised. there are dark in lhirsute. but the biggest change is that jonathan has completed his transfer and cest it becomes the new dracula and he went back through leurope horseback to reach his castle jimagine. it revives the evil inextinguishable impregnable. but the best part of this film is in final quil found through well-directed actors perfectly lexpressivit√© body language all the way and despite the color and dialogue, much reduced, however, it was like a silent film speaking. the only novelty at this level is of course the quality of makeup and shooting. it was therefore a true remake in the way dracula and lucy are encamped here physically and discursively by the syntax of the body. coulardeau dr. jacques, university paris dauphine &amp; university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
