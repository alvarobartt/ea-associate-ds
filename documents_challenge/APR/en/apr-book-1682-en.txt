i devoured all three volumes in record time, some years ago already, and i found these books fascinating for what they bring knowledge about the first emperor, and manners of the age, religion, wars, etc., the intrigues of the court, the meteoric rise and equally rapid falls close to the court, with just enough romance and never let go of the story before the last page.
