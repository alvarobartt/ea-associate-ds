in my childhood memories, this film was a special place for her suspense. the growing threat of these "small" ants throughout the jungle, until the final showdown between man and small animals was oppressive. alas, the film and the plot have not survived. the number-misanthropic misogynist (one can change the order) by charlton heston dragging long bugged me and the "naked" have shrunk. today, this story is no longer afraid and would need a damn lift, or more exactly a remake, which would make him all the intensity it has lost. pity.
