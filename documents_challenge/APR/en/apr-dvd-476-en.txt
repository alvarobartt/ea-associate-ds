i loved sin city, i loved 300, but the spirit at all ... the film is completely incoherent, it is badly done (the beard samuel l. jackson who departed in the middle of the film ...), style image is there, as in others, but the story is so no everything is ruined! the relationship between eva green and the spirit is the most basic short ... nothing held me back with this film, i never look ... hoping that the next is better, what do worse than to be tough!
