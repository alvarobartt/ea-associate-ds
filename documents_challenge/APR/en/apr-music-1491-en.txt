to me, 'sgt peppers' is not the best beatles album, far from it. it does not make much more than a pure masterpiece, just like most other drives of the group elsewhere. we will always hold forth on the fact that this is a hard to cut and mccartney's request, that the whole is overvalued, it is still impossible not to recognize some form of influence on this who will follow in the history of pop-rock. the sequences are still amazing and the trio of titles that starts the album remains forever etched in the collective unconscious. for that alone, this 'sgt peppers' deserves 5 stars.
