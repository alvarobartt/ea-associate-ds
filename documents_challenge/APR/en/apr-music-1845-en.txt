warning! warning! if you're like me a big fan of saigon kick (we have to be a small ten in france), do not be fooled by your curiosity. this "greatest hits live", which one wonders how he got out, is a horror. already, he has a "greatest hits" in name only. a quick glance at the setlist you will quickly see how a very large number of classic conspicuous by their absence. this disc is a compilation of songs recorded on various tours between 1991 and 1996. there is no unity in this live, which is already quite unpleasant, however, all songs have one thing in common: poor sound! quite simply, we feel like listening to a bootleg. and yet, i am already come across some very good pirate recordings, this one is not one. what a disappointment! short, unless you are masochistic tendency to push you impose the consumption of live albums to its rotten, nothing should make you buy this cd (even if you're a fan). saigon kick was an excellent group unfortunately far too understated, this disc is just unnecessary dirtying his memory.
