this is the edition that i criticize. with this new format, we try we punting to a new high price .. fans of prince with the red and bhan m! have compared the shm-cd, cd japan (earlier), the european cd (in fact pressed in germany), the u.s. cd and vinyl u.s.. it appears that the vinyl away from the little cd u.s.. this cd has a higher volume in comparison with the original cd is all. so the big disappointment of the shm-cd format. as currently in production today, the dynamics are neglected in favor dun its loud ultra compressed. considering the price this does certainly not worth the investment. so buy the normal edition.
