obviously, given the noise, it would be good to put 5 stars. but with the spawn unanlmité, it has never been my forte. i prefer to have an opinion rather than opinion. let's be clear: the french song, this is not what i like most. the french song in the early 60s, participated in the infamous stew that filled the radio without hope for a spark of light . then there was frank ténot and daniel filipacchi, then the generic slc ( "last night" of mar-kays) and finally the miracle fab four. the big bang gave birth to the planet rock. meanwhile, the beautiful voice singing in french maintained a course that the french soup dear to pascal sevran attempted to drown in an infamous hotchpotch (the latest in: helene segara, garou, laurie .. ..) so there was brassens, brel, piaf and nougaro. this beautiful home piaf, is what she sings, not what it is. what she is neither beautiful nor ugly, is his life. his life belongs to him while his work offers us the only thing that matters is his work. his life and that this form dahan and cotillard have no interest that even hollywood has oscar winner. it should be "so typical" and "so french" débulbés that the film industry could not resist. so a crown of stars piaf singer and a star of miss cotillard
