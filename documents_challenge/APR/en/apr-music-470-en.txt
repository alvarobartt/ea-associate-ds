here is the album that introduced me forever to rock and music in general. when "apetite ..." appeared in the mid ann√©ess 80, it was a sonic meteor from the heirs of the stones and aerosmith ... guns n 'roses is synonymous with rock attitude in everything she can be excesses in his music as both scenic. the tracks on the album are connected such as hits, introduced by a now legendary "welcome to the jungle", a "paradise city" remains my favorite track and concludes with a final mind-blowing for "rocket queen". nothing but good after all!
