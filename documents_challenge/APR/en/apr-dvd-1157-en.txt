the film by joe dante has taken quite a blow of old. the photo and the lack of resources make this movie look more like a tv movie on sunday evening at a lighthouse out of the genre, although some ideas punctuate the film (some plans in the forest). only really good idea badly exploited: "the colony" of werewolves. but the lack of scale of the staging, assembly line to die make it verges boredom, even the end of the movie sinks into the ridiculous. they much prefer "the werewolf of london" of landis in the contemporary "howling" good winded today.
