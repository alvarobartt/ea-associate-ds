warning! this dvd contains a version of the play designed for television (france 2) limited to 2 hours! the 2nd act has been dropped altogether (except for a few minutes). however, these elements are not shown on the outer packaging but only on the leaflet available after unpacking track. they are also not indicated on sale web sites. it's a shame because the staging of vitez and the brilliant performances of french actors would have made a reference version.
