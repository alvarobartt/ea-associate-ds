one of my worst musical! what to say: on the form i have done, once again, by the rave reviews of applicants to the ent service. in "hell freezes over" the sound was as perfect as mastering sdr was lousy (medium severe and extreme withdrawal, medium, high and sharp protruding extreme acute non-existent ...) it was enough to settle for stereo analog obtain a balanced listening, credible and coherent sound image stage. here it is different: the sound evokes varieties 70s, with low medium and high nonexistent medium-high aggressive, only low pin derive their game as for the dts: how awful! no subwoofer or low medium, high medium-high invasiveness in short, a musical cartoon destroying every image and sound room effect. the guitars play only on two strings, the singers were castrati. the "cinema-bass," i never use, provides what is lacking in the extreme bass, without changing the rest of the spectrum and the musical image projected in front of pregnant and miserable. recordings in dts copy exist yet diana krall - live in paris, sanseverino - live theater sebastopol, zazie - ze live, etc.. substance: so how come that all these strangers to the group? " saxophones, electric guitars, accordion - you name it and best - what interest? except impress kangaroos and spoil the fun of others! why engineers varieties of anglo-saxon not they go take lessons with their talented french counterparts, experts jazz or sometimes varieties? why not indulge in often excellent dolby digital 5.1, absent from most dvds in dts disgusting? instead of fiddling with the original stereo analog tape into a mixture grotesque and painful! what a disappointment!
