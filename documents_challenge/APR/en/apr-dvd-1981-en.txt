this saga was really poorly with a scenario completely "disjointed". after sagas such as zodiac, the zodiac master and dolmen (i speak for tf1) that had scenarios that really kept in suspense, this saga has really been a big disappointment ! there was the idea that is true but this idea has been botched by writers not up to the concept, unfortunately. even the casting was not within the level. and the final was the icing on the cake "was a pathetic or" how to finish a series when you have no idea in the sense that the theme of the series inconsistency "in short to sum it was a disappointment at the height of the mediocrity of the script.
