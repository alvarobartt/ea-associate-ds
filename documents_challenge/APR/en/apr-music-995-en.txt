i bought the cd and dvd, it is complemented perfectly! that mean? interpretation is superb. those who saw the film in french regain the same interpretations and therefore will not be disappointed. anastasia is among the most beautiful film music. we could not see the movie without music because it is an essential element. my daughters (19 and 12 years!) and i did not tire of listening! frankly, i recommend it.
