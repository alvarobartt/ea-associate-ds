i loved everything except the alexander garden zubial latter and miss liberty! unrealistic, each chapter is repeated. the characters, history, the consequences of distracted adjectives are exhausted and sad. alexandre jardin has finally realized that love can not love forever with the same person unless the death takes care of it! is this the end of an author? or just a theme. mr. garden has talent but not when not writing his guts!
