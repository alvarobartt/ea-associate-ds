purchased on the strength of historians informed the rock thing and the cult status of the album, this disc i found a nasty surprise. apart from the extraordinary opening (you're gonna miss me "), the disc is a series of rather flat and repetitive rhythm'n'blues fat. nothing psychedelic, garage in the suburbs.
