by dint of listening to my turntable, it was still necessary that i get it on cd! probably the best achievement of the group genesis. a fabulous disc, everlasting, timeless, that after the excellent "nursery crime", "trespass", presaged a group in the future very vast. only this time foxtrot be short-lived release "genesis live", "selling england by the pound," and finally "the lamb lies down on broadway". peter gabriel left the band after the latter album, and steve hackett, genesis and become another genesis. some achievements will be correct or good: "a trick of the tail," "wind and wuthering", "then they were three," .. but none of them have the impact of the age 5 with musicians peter gabriel. to conclude, yes, foxtrot was the great "detonator" that enabled genesis to exist.
