i bought this book by chance, following a review blog. i expected just a gay book, actually. because i buy something like that, depending on the subject. sometimes gay books, sometimes books in english, sometimes polar, sometimes i know-but-not-be-seen-well. the story of this young boy who sees in three times in his life, childhood , teen, young adult, was nice, a little cold portrait of a company average in france for 70 years. glassware, suburbs, poverty, the wedding. well it was nice, but that does not convince me. password again. i was very evil, cons, with the style of the author. i'm probably formatted in a genre, i do not know indeed, but these sentences long and indigestible, these appearances of words between &lt;and&gt; no logic as the only signs of delirium in the middle of writing it did not. overall i forced myself to finish this book because i wanted to like everyone, he let his chance. i think it has something strong, something good, something you might like. but that does not fly at all.
