it has struggled to find in the marketplace or the websites las 4 5 6 versions in cardboard box for the bonus and in september we made one, it shows the old episodes edition 2dvd collector rid of that hatred ! i am disgusted ... but i bought new versions despite the fact that my credit card to see star wars again tells me "i can no longer !!!!!!!"... but here it was still entitled to the old version (the first that everyone has found it there a long time on this planet!) and vhs were my early retirement so yes a marketing coup! or not one stood out (the last hope for my fanaticism has its limits and a collector edition 30 dvd is really a hard blow to take. i admit it's a low blow this comment but it is also exactly what come!! dirt!
