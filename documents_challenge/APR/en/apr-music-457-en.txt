i fell madly in love with tv on the radio. "desperate youth" is out there over a year ago, and since not a week before i could do without listening to "staring at the sun" or "ambulance". this disc is definitely demanding a classic, a landmark disc. it is true that dave sitek was not his first attempt, the man has still found coco rosie, the yeah yeah yeahs, the liars or celebration. we knew his talent as a producer, but it appears that his talent as a composer is even more immense, especially used by the majestic voice of thunder, the charismatic leader of tvs. in short, a great and huge hard, absolutely essential.
