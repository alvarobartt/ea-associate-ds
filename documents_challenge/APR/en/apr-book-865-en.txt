joseph is in sixth, we learn everything he wrote during the school year: her diary, her essays, letters and short poems he wrote for his beloved yasmine, her classmate who unfortunately with fate the ignoble benamou, small words that goes "under the counter" in class ... i had hitherto never been convinced by the novels of patrick cauvin, but it seduced me frankly. the format is original: the book contains writes joseph and only that. there never has reviews adult or anyone on his writings. when there are exchanges of words we see only what he writes joseph have to imagine what the other answers and, as the book is well designed, we did not hurt to guess. this style gives a lot of freshness to the novel. all adults will gather pieces of their childhood. i loved the poems that joseph sends yasmine (if only my neighbor had me writing like this when i was in college ...) and return to the top this little boy so imaginative and funny. fun to read as joseph indignation against the injustices of life (the coldness of yasmine, underpants dating, holiday in champlatreux ...) that his literary creations and his attempts to seduce the beautiful yasmine . a book that will be appreciated by young and old.
