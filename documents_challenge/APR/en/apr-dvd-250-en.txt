i found this movie quite simply terrifying. i saw him a week ago and i still think (including one scene in particular ...). i found the emotions i felt watching blair witch project. the atmosphere of the film is very special, very oppression. while there are no special effects or big ways, but the result is there. beside ring, films like "scream" are very pale face. the survey is part exciting and keeps us in suspense until the end. it is thought the film ended and no ... (i repeat, there is a particularly terrifying scene that i am not ready to forget and that makes me shudder just to think again ...) a must-see if you want to scare you!
