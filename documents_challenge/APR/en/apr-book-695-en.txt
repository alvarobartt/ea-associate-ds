i love dean koontz. but then, what a disappointment! the subject was very catchy and yet promised a crazy story, a story that could happen at all, and yet ..... finally, one could say it happens almost nothing. the story does not take off and the end is far-fetched. ... in short a gun idea but ultimately it is a turnip.
