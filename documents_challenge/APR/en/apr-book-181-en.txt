after purchasing the lesson on "buttons", which i liked, i wanted to offer me other lessons: creams, pasta and cakes, traditional cakes, the decoration on confectionery. it must be said that recipes are well explained, but i have not read all loved in "classic cakes" for example, the need to use rolls of pastry ready to use. no problem, i thought of first, the recipe for puff pastry is in "pasta and pies. not at all! the puff pastry christophe felder is it a secret? 100 euro for buying, we should have something more, even by a guru of the pastry as mr. felder. i do not recommend this title to all those who are not beginners from the patisserie
