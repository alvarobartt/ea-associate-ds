typically the work that is revered for having even written. incredibly funny and sarcastic the galactic backpacker's guide gives you an undeniable decline in cosmic life, the universe and everything else. first volume of an incredible saga it is impossible not to rush on to other books to know what happens next. for there exists a sequel which is perhaps also the beginning. or is another of those incredible temporal paradoxes so dear to d. adams, their genial author. i very highly recommend this book to all lovers of the absurd and the monty python humor. to all those who seek meaning in their existence abstain. they get surprised by the response.
