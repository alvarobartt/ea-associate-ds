at first, it can only be delighted by these actors dressed as elvis. it feels light comedy full of humor that we will be happy until the end. then something happens, and then no one were to realize at once the film goes nowhere, it stretches endlessly, with no real thread to become grotesque at the end. it's a shame, because kevin costner was excellent in his role loss, and one would have expected a film more thought that this cluster of scenes put together.
