the video for "most high" was lost on this shocking story! the massacre of "black dog" bonus does not help! when will we wake up in europe? why fly to morocco cultures mix? what page and plant led zeppelin leave where it is! if they are no longer able to play their monstrous pieces of seventies, they leave us intact! "unledded" is aptly named: it decays with joy led zeppelin! "no quarter", is what civilization we reserve enemy ... the interviews with page and plant excuse anything. where is the pagey dashing guitarist in this bloated? and what does plant with him incapable of vocalizing ravages of "whole lotta love" and "immigrant song"? and most importantly, where is john bonham? what? he died? then you should have called this album "a led dead"! ! "obviously, my negative review will not prevent the sales of this dvd. everyone is "it" the pinnacle. personally, i chose the pillory. ca t'gÃªne? not i! ozzbourne does worse than himself, the founder of the airship crashed ... meeting our seventies! hurry.
