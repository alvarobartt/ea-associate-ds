the film certainly looks like the "blair witch project" in many respects, particularly in terms of how to shoot, slam, camera in hand, with different perspectives that we bring into the skin of people who stalk the couple heroes ... basically, we expect a great film, but they (well, those) who stalk olivia bonamy and his companion are not monsters, not witches or ghosts but totally human beings, we show that the wickedness, cruelty and madness have no face ... no age ... the perversion can sometimes start very young, and some games of terror can easily turn the game killing .. . certainly, the film is not necessarily transcendent, but he still can think and challenge all the same ...
