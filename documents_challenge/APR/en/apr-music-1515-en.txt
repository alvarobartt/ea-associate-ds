this disc consists of tracks recorded between 1972 and 1982, but have not found a place in the albums of the era, not because they were smaller ... but because the producer and friend of jj.cale, audie ashworth, had thought they did not agree to the ambience of a particular album, or especially for occasions just like songwriter jj.cale . now time has passed, the image is no longer to build (do not), and fortunately these small stand of the closet. the sub-title "best of" proposed by amazon may be misleading on this point: what are new titles appearing on the album. "unreleased recordings" is on the cover and it is clearer.
