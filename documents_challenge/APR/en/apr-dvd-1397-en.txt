as usual, it's great art to robin williams! it is so perfect that doctor who sheet of propriety and seeks to heal through laughter, but without overdoing it. we would like to be pampered by a doctor like him, which takes into account the opinion of the patient and gives him a name and therefore identity rather than to characterize it by a series of symptoms. i am an unconditional fan of the great robin.
