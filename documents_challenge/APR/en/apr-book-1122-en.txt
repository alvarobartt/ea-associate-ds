it happens to every writer's great to have bad patches, it is my opinion the case of john le carré with this book missed, sort of spy novel with rose water. le carré is the sub-square, reuse, but worse, the processes of his masterpieces in a plot that deals fairly well on a fascinating geopolitical, kivu, but especially dark chapter by chapter sentimentalism softened through a main dish and exasperating. his last masterpiece was "the constant gardener." i hope the next will be at this level.
