and as much if it was true? plunged me into a sleepless night for this novel so fascinating .... but what a disappointment by reading this second part! the supernatural is also taking over and the characters are somewhat smoothed. this result disappoints me ... better to be more himself in his head since then there will be no disappointment. by reading this series i have not found this suspense, this story so incredible but we convaonc it is possible and real.
