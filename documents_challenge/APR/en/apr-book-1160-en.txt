usually, i have some reluctance to the reading rousseau. especially his emile, where he lavishes good advice on education, which he hastened to put his own children in public care ... but there c'est du grand art! i, who know well in switzerland, is a pure happiness. the alps are described very poetic, the characters are extremely endearing and at no time, it is tempting to think that this ode to love is pure "old-fashioned." the history of all these characters over time is exciting romanesque.leurs thoughts and deeds are very current and difficulties in love too. a masterpiece!
