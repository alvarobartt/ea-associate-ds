i just watched the movie because i like besson jamel. no a priori so. the pictures are beautiful paris in black and white plans is incredible beautiful. and fortunately there is the image because the story is completely bogus, it's hollow, tearful. it sounds fake. it seems that besson made this movie only to get another model in ultra short skirt on the screen. both held ultra-short going well in the 5th element is that i do not see the point. an angel shows her ass all over the place ... any interest in history? note that jamel is walking the entire film with his overcoat and his angel striding half-naked paris. plus some bathing in the seine. they are not timid angels. a film for aesthetic images, therefore, a beautiful paris and a beautiful girl, that's it. regarding jamel, i am sure he is not very credible but avoiding comedy (sorry!) the remake of love story totally dork.
