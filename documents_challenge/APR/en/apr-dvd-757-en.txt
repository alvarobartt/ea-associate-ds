see david lynch make such a masterpiece for only his second film (after eraserhead) is simply amazing. everyone has more or less heard of elephant man and watched clips of the film, but how many have actually seen this masterpiece? it does not appear intact in this melodrama, both the intensity and emotion that emerges from the story by moving the game actors (anthony hopkins and john hurt remarkable). later achievement, light and photography in black and white give this victorian england atmosphere particularly striking, almost fantastic, that is perfect about the film: intolerance and biases against the difference. this is a theme that has often been treated in cinema, but never with as much accuracy and power than in elephant man.
