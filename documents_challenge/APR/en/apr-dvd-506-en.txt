the film holds up throughout. above is the realism that is interesting, respect for natural laws of physics. with one exception: another p. plan clich√© with the comet through space in ... vombrissant. when the director going to get the public out of this photo, then everyone should know that no sound can propagate in vacuum inter-planetary? at the end of the film, the scene of tsunami waves is breathtaking. all heroes will not be saved, so the happy ending is not systematic, yet a good realism for a very good film.
