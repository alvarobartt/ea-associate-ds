this comment can apply s to all albums since divine intervention: slayer 20 years ago has found a recipe and applied consistently in the same way since. a bit like a brand of detergent or toothpaste, so they have a target audience for whom the product should be slayer and so do not touch the formula. then these morons have no trouble selling these off of metallica in all their interviews but at least metallica does not repeat itself for 20 years! and like the original is always better than the copy: if you want the slayer, buy or reign in blood seasons in the abyss. divine intervention is saved by bostaph but since ca dire need of inspiration ... tu m surprised that their albums do not exceed 40 minutes
