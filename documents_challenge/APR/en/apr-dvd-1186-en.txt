when is the only worthy version of dumas, one conducted by denys the patelli√®re with jacques weber monte cristo more than life. the completion, distribution and interpretation of the actors are wonderful. how can anyone believe for a moment a monte cristo-depardieu? let those who love this version reread (or read?) dumas.
