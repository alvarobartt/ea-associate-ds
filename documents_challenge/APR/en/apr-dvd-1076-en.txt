the film icon archétypée (in a good way) of brutality and mass destruction. for anyone who has never seen this work (what luck he'll be able to see with new eyes) the explosion of violence and bias of the 1st degree absolute leave indelible marks. a film strong, powerful, masterfully filmed and brutality (this is the most appropriate superlative) unheard. nutshell, is an absolute masterpiece.
