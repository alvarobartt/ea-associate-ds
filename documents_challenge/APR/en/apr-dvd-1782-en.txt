those familiar with the intermediate step of collection fitness zone with jessica mellet mallier also know that alexander was a teacher of the dvd (here, the situation is reversed: jessica mellet is a secondary teacher and alexander mallier is the main teacher). here, the course is curiously 01h04. i say "curiously" because the dvd is badly cut. in this period, there were 2 minutes of stretching (which are usually in another chapter) and one minutes of end credits. the course is fast and prof not very pedagogue. it is not enough on the sequences and the explanation of each step (as opposed to step through the collection fitness area). but it still happens in the course. the choreography is fun and being energetic enough. it revolves around many of the step. it takes place on the left and right of the step.
