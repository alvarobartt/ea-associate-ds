i was initially very positive about this film valeria bruni tedechi, and my god how boring ... both in substance and form. the story drags as well as directing and acting. i spent my time playing with her, for between valeria expressed in one breath and the hysterics of chiara variations are terrible. no interest in this film ... i wonder how she managed to assemble such a range of stakeholders, and sadly this is happening is that the fortune she knows how to take?
