"la scala" was my first real musical emotion, my first tears. i read as some liken to "köln concert" is, without any condescension, a lack of trial, as opposed to two concerts in form. "la scala" is built on a burst of physical pain, we feels fully in the first and long piece, moving when the musician seems to be following us and gratifies flights of exceptional intensity. the core set loose skin shivers and this music is for the body, very little to the right. its immediacy, its heat almost palpable make mention engineering, technical disarming cut your breath at times. darker, deeper, more intense, more difficult (see second piece) short, so different from the "köln concert" "la scala" is the monument of jarrett's career, an experience of sound, touch, we forget.
