i do not know how many times i listened to this movie, probably a hundred times. i already had it in vhs tape well before it was bought on dvd. i do not think i can explain my enthusiasm if not saying that every time i allow myself to take this wonderful story. the music continues to carry me through his lyrical beauty rarely achieved in cinema is what i call a masterpiece.
