i discovered archive with londinium, most excellent album trip hop ... in the process, i threw myself on "you all look the same to me" and there: horrible disappointment! it is very far from the trip hop of londinium, and it is rather a comeback pink floydien, time baba. even the use of synths i do not mind finding trip hop londinium. the singer has changed again (!) and his voice is a little hard to my ears .... in short, if you're a fan of pink floyd, do not hesitate a moment! if you've snapped on londinium and expect the same thing you all look the same to me, do!
