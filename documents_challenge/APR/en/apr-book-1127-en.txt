fernandez has been well documented for writing this book: you will find traces of most major works of the master ... this is not an exploit. this kind of thing is studied in detail in all the right schools (ecole du louvre ...) in terms of style i'm disappointed: a novel in first person was the best choice? the characters are not sufficiently described or else too: it confounds all the eminences and monsignors which makes the plot difficult to follow. i did not like the sequences of interrogative sentences is boring to read. overall i am rather disappointed by this book: caravaggio deserves better.
