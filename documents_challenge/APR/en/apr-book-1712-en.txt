the weight of years is clear: if this little introspective opus could pass for corrosive and subversive to the late 60's, it now seems stale 40 years later compared to "elementary particles" houellebecq or "survivor" by palahniuk ( for example) ... second pitfall: we are here confronted with a book not for readers but for writers. you will appreciate the winks and irony of the thing if you're the little world of publishing, otherwise you may well not feel concerned by this trend of self-absorbed author missed. moreover, the story is very linear, with no plot or even the shadow of any rebound in the rantings of the author of soft porn at 4 under. we end up bored stiff and voyeurs can not even cling to the hope of a few pages so hot that book is totally devoid of sex according to the criteria of our good old twenty-first century. finally, for enthusiasts, beware: this mess is anything but a thriller. in short, to book for fans of westlake.
