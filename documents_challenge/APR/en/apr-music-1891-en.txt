in 10 years, fleetwood mac went from nice and mowed group of english blues-rock of the second division, a super-anglo-american west-coast style billionaire. meanwhile, there was "rumors" and sales pharaohs. this has enabled fleetwood mac excesses of all kinds. the nostrils in the coke, the band retreats to the studio and released the "tusk" chore more than 70 minutes without head or tail, boring and soulless. the cruel lack of inspiration is obscured by tape production -to-eye with and flashy. rock made by bobos for sores. while ok for pretty melodies, vocal harmonies, arrangements and all the circus-west coast. but well, "tusk" was released in 1979. the same year the "london calling" clash. the fortuitous timing are sometimes ruthless.
