there is nothing to say in terms of technique, the film is controlled from beginning to end by jan kounen: images sublime, magnificent scenery, special effects quality. although the idea of the scenario is interesting, i found that the shamanic experience itself is a bit too long. the film has the merit to exist and the best way to get an opinion of seeing.
