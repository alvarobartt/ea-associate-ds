well, if you enjoyed and found the fabulous song "loch ness" of the previous album of judas priest angel of retribution, then you'll love nostradamus. if like me you are getting the same title as one of the most useless of judas priest, well, forget nostradamus very quickly, because they are two cds in the same vein. this is more of judas priest. it is distressing, even more grotesque and priest has the nerve to present us this album as their new masterpiece (to quote their website). masterpiece for them, perhaps (it is never better served than by yourself) but it really take the fans for pigeons. album forget.
