i do not know or not sure (on other sites) have seen that the treatment was bad dvd! i have the english (for the discontent that insist on vo!) and i must say that this first season is french nickel, not even any snow on the image. i would say that the quality is superior to some other time series (wonder woman for example). even the broadcast 13th street was not better. in short, you should not miss. a quand la suite? eric
