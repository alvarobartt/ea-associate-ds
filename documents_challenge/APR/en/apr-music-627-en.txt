being a fan of this group, i did not wait long to buy it. the bbc sessions are beautiful and excellent live. their main tubes are present even if some lack. for my part, on the first, there is "like dylan in the movies" and "sleep the clock around". on the second, there is "there's too much love" and a cover of the beatles "here comes the sun". nothing to say, this cd brings us back to one of the most beautiful period of the group, ie the envoisinant the 2000s. this disc is sent to the fans.
