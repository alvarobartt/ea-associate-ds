the interpretation of this young chinese violin concerto of tchaikovsky mark adult and child. it is true that the sad story that accompanies the young boy touches the heart more sensitive. it is a beautiful story, a modern fairy tale about a musician's ability to express what he really feels and to give ... or the ability of each human being to give even if it does nothing! or so little! has not missed in my humble opinion
