the genius of queen was to have been able to combine complex without the grotesque and the sublime. with this album, that alchemical science of the cake, the butter and cooking oil is at its flavor: the critics are disgusted, but the public want more! the figures speak for themselves: over four months of recording, six different studios, a hollywood budget, a platinum disc around and "bohemian rhapsody" which truste head of the british charts for nine weeks! musically, "a night at the opera" is a kind of summit unsurpassable: despite the molten metal of "death on two legs" or "sweet lady", the hard-rock gimmicks flaming are placed under the extinguisher at use of pieces of music hall in the delightful satire (not very far away after all of a ray davies) as "lazing on a sunday afternoon." elsewhere, the bombastic progressive side who takes precedence over "39" or about eight minutes of "the prophet's song." bassist john deacon, a connoisseur of the tamla-motown's go even a "you're my best friend" terrific. "seaside rendezvous" is an overlooked gem too: beautiful piano ballad introduced romantic and reminiscent as elton john, mccartney and phil spector, then completely new ... and fully inflated! finally, of course there's "bohemian rhapsody", six minutes long anthology, divided into three equal parts, imitating opera stomping hard-rock to led zep, summoning progressive asylum: finally rock-type proletarian par excellence-captured opera, bourgeois kind ultra-coded to make this piece absolutely enjoyment, both ultimate parody exacerbated romanticism. everything ends with the little instrumental 'god save the queen ", on which the pistols will spit in a few months, and that queen merely sprinkling of pink whipped ... grotesque? yes, but also sublime ... and what virtuosity, please!
