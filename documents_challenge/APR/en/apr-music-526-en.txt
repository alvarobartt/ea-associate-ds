it must be said at the time, queen had more first studio album worthy of the mega-group they were (except perhaps the album "the miracle"). in its race to stay alive musically and probably driven by commercial imperatives, the group had opted for pieces "fashionable" (popinettes disco and cheesy). here, i must say they have strong, delivering a consistent album and good bill. i knew the best-known songs ( "these are the days of our lives" and "the show must go on") but the rest is in keeping. he deserves to be included alongside the other great albums of queen ( "a day at the races," "a night at the opera", "sheer heart attack", "news of the world", "metal").
