if the author manages to show good cause global democracy, it fails to show why all men are, according to him, now ready to live in democratic political systems. in case his argument is sometimes a little light: democracy is presented as a perfect political system where everyone is beautiful and nice. but its "commonly accepted truths and it is no longer necessary to show" more like wishful thinking and systematically pass over in silence all the ills and problems of existing democracies (highlighted by example 'why i'm moderately democrats'). in short, a book not unattractive but not essential.
