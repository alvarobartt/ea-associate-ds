a film too ambitious. difficult challenge than to try to make a film about the emptiness and superficiality without risk of falling unpeu yourself. the sequence of journalists who pump their work on the other, fanci ridiculed, ambition was too strong and blew too soft. we do not believe in this mode there is crying in this community and we regret having seen the film ... rest, actors outstanding.
