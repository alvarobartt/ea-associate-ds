this is a pure product marketting: a book by a writer who has surfed on the foam of his first novel worthy of the name: "superstars" (recommended). here, the result is really beneath contempt, the plot is crying, the arts to enhance its poverty are as big as "mooring ropes" and plagiarize at will his previous novel "superstars" (memories its connection with the damsel who is missing ...) you'd think that after him, everything that ann scott had to say was said. truly a reading of rer station, guaranteed anti-vibration (large letters) and jerky playback (you can easily skip pages and paragraphs: history is a succession of repetitions rather painful)!
