one of my favorite albums (of any pop music!). the cuts follow a natural way with an overall cohesion rarely seen thereafter. certainly, there are no guitar solos or very complex arrangements, but a sound and originality in the melodies and arrangements outside the ordinary! an album i always listen with great pleasure!
