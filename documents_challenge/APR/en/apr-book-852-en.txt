i am simply amazed that we could called it a book, it only tell his story (and the novel is not even completely autobiographical ...) by reducing all to herself constantly. again it to go but there is nothing, a book is empty! i had to read for the prix goncourt and i am rarely so bored. moreover its layout makes it a nonexistent book even more indigestible than it was with paragraphs! i strongly advise against it unless you're stranded on a desert island and is the only book that there are around (and again ....)
