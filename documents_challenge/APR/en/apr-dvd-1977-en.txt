this dvd is truly one of best in class. it presents the first concert after the release from prison of jon. the crowd is excited, and once the group arrives, they blow up the room has great shots riffs pests in the purest style dissection. bonuses are also of great quality: the interview is really good. there are no subtitles, but jon speaks intelligible english without too much emphasis. it traces his career with dissection motivations etc.. the only snag: i tried to access several hidden bonus dvd players (4 or 5 i think) and i've still not found. this time we will have loved them less hidden.
