and i'm nice ... i think i am an amateur jazz, with over a thousand records, haunting concert and festival and practicing music together. after years of hesitation, i ended up buying this opus. i was afraid to find myself with a collection tube deified by ear knowing almost nothing to bop. of course, blue rondo and take five were arias known and well played. the pb is that i do know that the shorts and that's the problem ... nothing but solo desmond blue rondo announces color: inventiveness level 0. as for walking, we saw students in school jazz 14 years to do as well. (early form of eugene wright ....). finally, the provision of brubeck on piano playing the same song: just listen (to 4 "50). it is not even in rhythm!!
