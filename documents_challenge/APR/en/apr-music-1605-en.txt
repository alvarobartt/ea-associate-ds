good already stopped that kyo is the rock! because if you think that, at least leave your home and you will see that true rock is something completely different! then we have some freedom of expression, so we have the right to give a bad review of a group. and then it is clear (i love that expression) that we have to hear this group at least once during the day either on tv or radio, yet i do everything not to hear. when is a duet with johnny? i think there is even closer to the metal ;-)
