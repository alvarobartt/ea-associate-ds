this book plunges us into the fascinating world of psychological analysis. a study report that installs between the patient and the psychoanalyst (here a sex therapist). the patient recounts to the sessions his unbridled sexual adventures (dream or reality?), and listening to the psychoanalyst is more disturbed by these confessions very pornographic. then a link will arise between the two women, but also the husband of the sex therapist, and then begins to escalate into debauchery and vice. i can tell you anything about the story but sometimes i have been very difficult not to win, because of the almost uninterrupted series of sex scenes. the psychological study, however, is relevant to readers and raises many questions (remember that the author is a recognized sex therapist). however, i do not keep this book an unforgettable, i am very disappointed.
