if you hope to spend some time with adam sandler (the king of the screwball comedy) or watch an interesting movie, it completely missed. this is a film for moviegoers rather telling the story of a semi that comes stamped his work, his hobbies and his 7 sisters consuming has never known love. the beginning is downright exasperating (many silences, lengths). the scene where he discovers that "piano" abnadonné is simply ludicrous. then, between long shots and dialogues without interest, the film goes on sequences with no relationship between them. the character of adam sandler is despicable and hateful and does not trigger qu'énervement. the summit, he found even in a blackmail organized by a mattress salesman who uses a special girl in pink messaging. this sequence has no interest in a word no place in the film. in short, by dint of wanting to be different, funky and is totally missed. avoid it!
