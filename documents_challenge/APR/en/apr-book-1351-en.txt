i had heard so much of the film before its theatrical release i wanted to read the book. i was very disappointed with my purchase. the style is awkward, the characters do nothing to me seemed endearing and contrary to what people say i have not found an ounce of feelings. this story describes very rustic a story of love that does not include the origin. in one paragraph to another one moves from the description of a late night around the fire to a scene of very graphic sex, i read 3 times to be sure not to have jumped the line but no!
