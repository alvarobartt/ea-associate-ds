i speak highly of this album as the guy seems nice and sincere, but ... it will not be possible until this new opus marble leaves me (note, i already hated the first). i do not mind that his music is present only to support his big voice, but there are limits to good taste, rarely listened to beats too flat chiantes and cheese. cmg best representative of the french slam scene? it's scary! his lyrics are boring and the possible rhymes, very expected. in short, i hated the last album great body sick: /
