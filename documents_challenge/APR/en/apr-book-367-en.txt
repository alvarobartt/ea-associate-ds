this is an album that makes you want to read more. the scenario melant romance and history is fascinating. this first opus so we left on our end that we eagerly want to know the end. the designs give off an incredible atmosphere, very gray with some bright colors emerging from time to time, it works wonders. may be less in the current tastes (this album was released in 1989) remains the excellent comic, i would add religion.
