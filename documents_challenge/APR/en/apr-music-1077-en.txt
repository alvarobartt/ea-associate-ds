this album is the second of the series "jazz reference" devoted to what was great tenor saxophonist lester young. it suggests 16 tracks dating mainly from 1951-1952, before the excesses that have marked its existence does not tarnish his game like no other. lester young gives us to hear a sound that is both powerful and light, sometimes transparent, free of any vibrato. the accompanying sophisticated and full of finesse rhythm sections at the beginning of their careers led by pianists who have become stars of jazz (oscar peterson and too little publicized john lewis) does wonders.
