a catchy topic go, buy! and then, the discovery of a write barrier: the descritpions heavy with exotic words to deceive the world, hollow characters, simpletons, a utopian attempt to try to pursue in parallel 2 times that of the expo and the colonial the march towards independence, a plot that comes down almost to having missed a damn train. sorry, i am not able to do both but i'm not a writer. as a reader, i give my feelings: disappointment was at its height.
