an excellent album that has to possess all amateur trip-hop and abstract hip-hop with the bar with two kinds of sizes in those of james lavelle and dj shadow, and also there featurings of eggs between another tom yorke and richard ascroft and many other. disk oscillates between pure hip-hop (drums of death part 1 &amp; 2), more pop song (my favorite bloodstain simply beautiful or rabbit in your headlights) and cuts more disconcerting (celestial annihilation). in short, we never bored throughout the listening ... then go for it!
