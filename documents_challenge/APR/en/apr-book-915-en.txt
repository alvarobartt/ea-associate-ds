i know very well the northern cheyenne nation since i made many trips to the lame deer reservation in montana where i made many friends and where i could study the history and culture of this people exciting. outside, i can assure you that this book is completely bogus and has no historical basis. the cheyenne women have always been considered among the peoples of the plains for their great virtue, and no member of the tribe would want to marry a young person who previously had sex with other men. in addition to the late indian wars, women were much more likely than men (there were many who had died in battle), so i see no reason why a cheyenne chief might want to ask that sends his people in 1000 white women of easy virtue to increase the population of his tribe. all this makes no sense. if you see serious documents of the time you can see for yourself that this book is pure fabrication. moreover cheyenne is also known to be very conservative and just not getting too involved in the white population (unlike many other tribes in the region). for those wishing to really gather information on the cheyenne people, better avoid this kind of work at any price.
