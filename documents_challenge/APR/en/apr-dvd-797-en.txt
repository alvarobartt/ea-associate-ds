the italian cinema of the years of lead especially liked westerns and police, unfortunately, treated as sub-genres just good to illustrate a series of shots in a sinister atmosphere and hyper-masculine (to seriously?). "keoma" n√©chappe no exception; this film, very simplistic, is so predictable that bored deep. in short, a waste of time despite franco nero. in addition he was shot in english, which adds to the artificial.
