8 minutes of super 8 unreleased, all complemented by cutting plan already published ... band recovered from his radio interview + or other recoveries of soundtracks or elvis monologue; rose all images super 8 and voila a dvd that comes not too expensive. avoid it, even (or especially) for fans like me.
