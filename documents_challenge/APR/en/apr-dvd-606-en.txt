i loved this film at the cinema and i bought the k7 video. logically, when the dvd is released i précipité.mais big disappointment is the dubbed french did nothing to see (text and voice) with the version of the movie or my video! it is a very adaptive random strip while in the air, it would seem that either the french version made for canada, so there is deception on the goods! this is unfortunate because the french are dubbing the best in the world and it's true! copy to avoid disappointment!
