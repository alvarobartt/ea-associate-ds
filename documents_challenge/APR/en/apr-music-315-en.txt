i'm not part of the usual audience of jean-louis murat and know virtually nothing of his repertoire. and then one day listening to the radio, i fall on emotion ... want want interesting. this song running through my head for some time. then again on the radio (the same as before), i hear the scream of the butterfly. that said, i need this album. i'm going to my favorite record store and buys the object. since it is simple, (s) run (nt) loop on my plate, which certainly did not play as original chanson francaise. the text is a pure beauty and instrumentation without being revolutionary brings additional depth to these beautiful poems set to music. a very nice discovery so that reconciles me (a little) with the french artists that i found rather silly. thank you mr murat.
