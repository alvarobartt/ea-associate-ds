a nice story that plunges us into a world burtoniesque tim. the writing is rich in poetic images. this gives an enjoyable read despite some heaviness in my opinion and some difficulties in creating an osmosis between the poetic style pre-quoted and a more contemporary style sometimes used. but this does not discount the pleasure that comes from reading this book .
