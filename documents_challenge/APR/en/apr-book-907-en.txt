here is india which the author cuts a bespoke suit. at once tender, funny, poetic, historical ... the destinies intersect, tailors and untouchable ishvar om, a parsi widow dina, a young student from these mountains in the big city. all end up in the small apartment of dina. tailors who are metaphors policy indirha gandhi, plunged into fantastic adventures, puppets whose fate evolves with new provisions made by those in power. dina seems to represent the idea of an india that is afraid of change but must evolve, frightened by the presence of the untouchables, it must learn to regard them as humans. it crosses all sorts of characters who come to complete this portrait of india. the master of beggars has both protective and cynical exploitation. shankar a crippled beggar, a collector of hair, a lawyer who loses his eyes in view and track correction by writing political slogans, a young student activist in love with failure and who mysteriously disappears. records if different, come together to form the landscape of india for 70 years. that of indhira gandhi.
