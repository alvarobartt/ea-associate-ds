i loved this cd. i am not an expert on classical music but i like to listen. i found this cd clear, light and air. the music is very beautiful and moving. in some ways, i had a feeling somewhat similar to this that i feel while listening to miles davis in a different area. in any case, these impromptu really deserve to be known!
