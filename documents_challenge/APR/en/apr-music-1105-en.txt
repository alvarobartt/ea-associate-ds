some say that the group has sold recording unplugged, the grunge kneels. but the reality is quite different: this album shows another side to nirvana, far from being unpleasant. kurt cobain is masterful, his cracked voice is moving and can not leave indifferent. nirvana's compositions are mixed with times as great "the man who wold the world" from bowie or "where did you sleep last night" by leadbelly. one thing follows from this album: unplugged is big, very big, and nirvana too.
