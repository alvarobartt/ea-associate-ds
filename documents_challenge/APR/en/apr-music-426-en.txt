being a fan of paradise lost draconian times since, is reading metal ---- i discovered that the guys came out of yorkshire another cake, obviously i plunged into reading the article and apparently chronic is rather the last pleasant thought and then i'm off to buy the cam from the dealer usual, and there is disappointment 1, 2, 3 plays nothing to harm the poison seeps into the veins or have passed the catchy choruses usual, or are the catchy melodies of understanding the dark side is now the guitars are mixed in before the album is firmly in the metal continuity in r√©quiem but unlike the latter pieces are connected soulless it almost starts to pitch down, not as strong as in other albums, riffs stick to other riffs neither more nor less it was not until the 9th bit heavy to super-fast solos and wish with all the rest so rare of paradise lost but still great for that it's something new, short to conclude there was the impression of an album is not finished to go quickly, a real disappointment compared to other albums has refined block in short, an album with half tint ranked alongside believe in nothing on the dusty shelf of league cd 2. disappointing.
