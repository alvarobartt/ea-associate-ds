in reading the amazon reviews that i decided to buy this disc, i had encountered in your favorite stores for ages. but the cover did not inspire me too. even if i knew the name of the group reputation, i thought i had to make to the basic heavy metal. pemière the listening has not transcended more than that, and then over days, weeks, i had in mind that these 17 songs! and what songs! ca dry deposition, but without ever falling into the heavy rock. ca complexion of the boogie, rock, folk, brief full of influences, it swings, the melodies are treated, the rhythmic of lynott and downey (bass, drums) is always inventive, and driven before the two guitarists. those two, robertson and gorham, we knit agreements sumptuous interweaving notes, swinging riffs very felt and impeccable solos. this aggressive just enough when it is subtle, elegant, refined the rest of the time. but rest assured necks, it's still damn good rock rocked! no tracks by extension, thin lizzy gives in the short format, striking, where each position is filled right notes, still in their places, neither too much nor too little . great art! the phil lynott's voice is warm, sensitive, away from trashy howler. the pieces enchainent quickly, the intensity rises gradually to measure, and the last four titles outright enfièvrent us! this "live and dangerous" is almost what one might call a miracle!
