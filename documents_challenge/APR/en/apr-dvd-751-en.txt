that i have been disappointed with this movie! anachronisms, historical impossibility, and poor scenario course expected. what comes to the treasure of the templars in the usa? how is this possible given that the usa was founded in the 18th century or some time after the demise of the templars, who were in no way ever had any treasure. and if c was the case, then pope clement 5 and the king of france, philip the fair in s would probably seized. only good thing about this film: the action. this film should rather have children or persons engaging little importance al history and who desire just a film of action to spend the evening. but those who compare the da vinci code ... my feelings are much worse on the turnip by dan brown. no how.
