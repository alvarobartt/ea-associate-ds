for fans of martial arts films, this is the best asian movie i've ever seen. in this film you will see incredible obstacles that man can imagine, for example a human bridge to cross a river i do not know how many meters. 14 women decided to avenge the last general of their royal family killed during the war in the frontier of china. to advise you to buy this movie, i say simply that it is the best in the 21st century. the film to preserve all life.
