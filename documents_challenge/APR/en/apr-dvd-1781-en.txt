this film is painful to see, firstly because it has aged terribly, unlike the music of the beatles, whom she has not aged. and their music is really the only interest of this film, but it boils down to some backing tracks. the story is heartbreaking, not even sure there was one for history has no meaning, the real players are caricatures, and the beatles just are not actors, it must be admitted. with hindsight it is obvious that the film is for fans, but is it not better to shoot a concert? see beatles engage in some tomfoolery is quite pitiful because they ridicule. the humor of this film is long outdated, and the film innovates nothing if not laid an nanar pure juice. however, the 2:00 collector's edition contains bonus, where players (not to beatles) detail the genesis and filming of the movie: all this is fascinating, much more than the film itself.
