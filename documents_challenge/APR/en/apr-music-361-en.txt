lp we repeated the blow of the album version 2.0 (see hybrid theory -&gt; reanimation). the live in texas had taped, here i am still on my hunger. but i liked their last studio album, minutes to midnight. then of course there are some good passages, certainly the final bleed it out is not bad, but it is not enough to take off their live performance. the presence of jay-z does in my view not great thing. and i really regret that mike shinoda harvest hands held high in a pseudo solo a cappella rap nickname for a title that deserved much better, especially since i believe chester here shows a more melodic voice, by compared to live in texas, which could have something pretty on this song. so to listen / watch for the super fans, others see it as a (very) big concert, very professional in approach, perhaps be too large (more money, less music ...).
