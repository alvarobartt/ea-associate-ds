a film on crack and expand an empire of drugs, yet ... nothing original. the acting is pretty bad and very exaggerated, roles and actions required of police officers are far from the reality of having no more than strategic logic. some scenes supposed to expand the plot is unfortunately predictable and the suspense is nonexistent. too bad! preferred substantially "scarface" or "donnie brasco". this is a personal opinion.
