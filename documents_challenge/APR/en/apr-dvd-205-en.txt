the further adventures of jason bourne is simply breathtaking. the pace is extraordinary, is not bored for a minute. the plot keeps us in suspense without fail, it is increasingly tense as and as the hunt for jason bourne intensifies ... in short a superb action film with a moment of anthology: the car chase in the heart of moscow! note that j. bourne drives a volga legacy of the soviet era ... whether in india, germany, russia, everything is credible and beautifully done and all the actors are performing. the shooting of the last component (the bourne ultimatum ) is in progress, strongly output (expected in september 2007)!
