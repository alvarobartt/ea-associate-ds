2 stars for combat, to fight because they believed in their enormous potential with motion and the man with a movie camera. we are hearing a real jazz content of high-flying (back to support reprocessing with inventive - see budy rich "channel 1 suite") instruments were a true expression in a novel fully merged with the samples. only now it is past a "every day" which is simply a repeating pattern without intrusion none of instrumental solos that also had finally let me dubiously amid a sea of emptiness. still convinced of their potential, i threw myself on "ma fleur" and then what a disappointment: an unexpected turn of identity (and certainly way) to an ethereal folk, with songs sung and curcus (music) not always clear. the whole turned out sugary, syrupy, soporific. nothing so far explains this shift, although a majority seemed to actually recognize a quality album. i'm still not able to love this music. this is perhaps another time.
