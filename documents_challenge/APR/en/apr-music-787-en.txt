when we listened to "songs in a minor", one wonders if miss keys will perform a second opus from the same cloth, so it was huge! this second album then, i j'l'attendais with im-pa-impatience! ... but must admit that the disappointment is an appointment! ... this album is not worth the first! "the diary" is not bad yet, with such pearls "if i was your woman / walk on by" which uses a beautiful piano sample glwadys knight, very languid "diary" and the sublime "if i is not got you "and" when you really love someone "(who are the best on this disc) but, as i told you when we heard the previous album, what it feels something missing here and it's infuriating! vivement le prochain.
