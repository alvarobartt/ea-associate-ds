this film is remarkable in that it gives at once a genuine and credible testimony on one of the biggest scandals of the twentieth century, but expanding on the questions about absolutely essential for everyone and that the answer is oh so difficult including "what have i done instead of cooperating young?"; "and instead of the belgian officer?", "how can you have said" never again "after the second world war, and not have not responded to the massacres in rwanda? ". the character of the priest, which reaffirms the primacy of the spiritual is magnifique.le film is terribly emouvant, sobering, but is well paced and without longueurs.le most beautiful film on the rwanda to date with "sometimes in april".
