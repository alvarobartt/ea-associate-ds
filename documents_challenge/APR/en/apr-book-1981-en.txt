pale imitation of bad novels swashbuckling spanish master of arturo p√©rez-reverte (the adventures of captain alatriste, 5 million copies sold). mr. cereza has in common with perez-reverte his name ' spanish origin and has obviously never held a sword or foil. the reconstruction of life in london in the late eighteenth century immigrants m nobles fleeing the french revolution is a terrible and incomprehensible din with a long litany of names meant describe the environment nobliaire french (thank you wikipedia) and commonplace (thank you the backpacker's guide "london 2007"). the whole is mixed with tall tales (crows killers, the huron fool who scalped the past, parties in fine red cape and so on). in short, it's really bad!
