it was his 1st or 2nd disk. the sorting preference in his discography would be inappropriate. bonnie sings and plays the blues on guitar ... and not the blues. the version of runaway eerie to those who listened to del shannon and those who listened to dave vanina. it rose in 1st part (.....) clapton in marseille. we would have liked the opposite. it's not on the fm band is meant bonnie.
