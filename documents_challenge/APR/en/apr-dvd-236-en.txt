after listing a large reinforcement of commercials, here it comes. the promise of quality is consistent, superb image whose contrast has been raised, the defects existent sewing, great job. the soundtrack to a were both completely reworked in 2.0 (which in some cases may be better than some evil remasterise 5.1) than the original version 5.1 that illuminates the special effects films (this is not just a doubling of track ). my rating 4 due to lack of 5.1 fr. the french public once again fined. but given the trade dvds, it can be expected to be a future release in 5.1? . in conclusion applies when purchasing the same time.
