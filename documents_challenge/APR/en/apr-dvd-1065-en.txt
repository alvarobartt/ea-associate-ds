john huston is the director general of the failure. adventures human aborted mediocrity or greatness crashing against reality: his characters rarely fail in their purpose, and most often the fight is lost. both films, more or less late, meeting in this package are good examples, while they each have a singularity is also typical of the gaze that was always complex huston on humanity. after a few mediocre films in the 80s, beneath the volcano signed huston's return to an ambitious movie, all the more ambitious he adapted the novel deemed unadaptable malcolm lowry. is it appropriate for all its aspects by huston elsewhere? not sure. we learn in the exciting interviews with huston provided that bonus was that the novel had undeniable beauty but it is sometimes lost in the verbiage. the fact remains that its reduction may seem a little too much. but the film is by his painting of mexico, and masterful interpretation of albert finney in alcoolo end of the race. the devil, meanwhile, is also his haunting interpretation (that of brad dourif), but is a model of literary adaptation. huston arrived to make the strangeness of flannery o'connor, in creating it otherwise, by means of film itself. indeed, during my first viewing of the film, a few years ago at the cinema, i was somewhat put off by this strange side, which makes the narrative is taken on roads that may seem exaggerated. in reviewing the film, it seems quite the contrary as a clarity and precision formidable. as the novel (the wisdom in the blood), it is more than a mere denunciation of recovery mercantile religion, it is yet too. it is indeed the portrait of a deranged man, which one would be hard to pinpoint the exact nature of his trouble, although many tracks are drawn (psychoanalytic, social, etc..). as usually, the package is yours carlotta: perfect copies, bonus high quality (vintage interviews with huston, analysis). provided they continue to showcase the heritage of film this way!
