one day arthur, a young architect from san francisco, discovers a beautiful young woman hidden in her closet, lauren. lauren was surprised to see it because it is ghost of his condition, his body resting on a hospital bed in a coma for 6 months, while his mind walk free. you can guess the rest ... we feel the "happy ending" coming full nose. a novel very light, style without relief, but this does not mean that we pass a bad time because the idea is quite original and it will leave soon away by the plot. a novel that is charming rather pleasant to read, an honest modern fairy tale, unpretentious, easy to consume.
