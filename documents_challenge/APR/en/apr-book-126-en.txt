this book is linked to 2 other of jules verne's mysterious island and children of captain grant ... it is a magnificent fresco retracing a journey full of twists and techniques of poetry at a time ... the characters are endearing, and references to several thousand other fields (philosophy, history, mythology, zoology ...) no need to read the mysterious island and the children of captain grant to read this fine novel that will leave you so much you do not have ended, but in my opinion, you can not stop you!
