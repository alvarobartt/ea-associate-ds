i pretty much liked his 1st album for his side fresh and original, as it disappointed me. i like some songs (the woman i like chocolate in particular), but i find the whole somewhat outdated and a little flat musically. if this is an album of fairly good quality, there is a quaint side can have its charm, but medium to which i subscribe. an honest production, therefore, but a little pale. furthermore, his voice can annoy after a while.
