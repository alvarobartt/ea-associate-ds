tommy is a 1975 film directed by ken russell. this is the transcript of the film rock opera by the who that changed the face of rock in 1969. the story is to crazy psychedelic and desires: a child becomes deaf, dumb and blind from trauma freud (he finds his widowed mother in bed with the man he thought was his uncle!). following a mystical revelation, it becomes the world champion pinball and is so revered that takes him to the messiah of a new religion. the story may seem completely different, but basically it reflects perfectly the questions of pete townshend (guitarist for the band) and the teachings of his spiritual master of india: an enlightened being can be understood by the people? how religions are they? these topics are very deep hidden under a layer of delirium typically "who", with bright colors and bad taste artistic statement!
