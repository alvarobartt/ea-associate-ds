in the 30 pages of this book, there are few models. achieving the rings are made with materials of rings found in the trade. the achievement of the bead polymer is easy to do, we understand well looking at the pictures. the models are not shown evidence of originality. i liked the ring of the cover and the roller opaque polymer surrounded by imitating a metal crimp. for the rest ..... nothing too exciting
