the film is very well done. we know because we had on vhs and wanted it on dvd. so we bought the "special edition" which has no "special" as its shortcomings. there the film, chapter points and the choice between french and english. no comments, no addition, no director's cut, no interviews ... nothing! then why call "special edition" edition a very low range? good film, but false advertising disappointing. if you find a lower price in "regular edition" buy it!
