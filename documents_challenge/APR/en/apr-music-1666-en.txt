finally, after 3 years of waiting the second album is out! fan of the first hour from the album "a beautiful world," i am pleased to again hear the fabulous music of robin. we all can feel the soul he has in each of these songs, which i'm sure you will touch you too. it is an incredibly talented artist. it is becoming increasingly known in the united states and we can just start hear some french radio ... i'm sure he will become the new essential artist by shortly. fingers crossed anyway! take you on this cd!
