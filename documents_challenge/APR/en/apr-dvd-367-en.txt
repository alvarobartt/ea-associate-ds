in discussing the world of journalism, season 5 of the wire ends the series on a small point of disappointment. while thematically journalism at its place in the series, he has none in the main plot for the war against drug trafficking in baltimore (or so it's very far-fetched), because the protagonists of the newspaper after another matter. we have the impression that the series is scattered on the one hand, and this season only serves to close the plot where the others went well beyond. impression reinforced by the fact that it is the shortest season 5 (10 episodes instead of 12 in average). however, this remains a very good season at all other points of view, much better than all series that invade our tv daily. listen exhausted on the last meters to go, but we would like any other set is exhausted in this way.
