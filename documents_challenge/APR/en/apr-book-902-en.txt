this book has answered many of my questions especially regarding the sentence of collision. i could see that everyone is as void as me which reassured me a lot! there are a lot of advice on communication in general, as the use of open sentences that i had already heard elsewhere but here was very well explained. there is a lot of tips and scenarios that can get into the bath immediately. it will be put in place for women to understand their reactions to a type of behavior, which is the key to understanding which must be adopted for dredging. the writing style is suited to the subject and makes reading easier. in short, a fun book, easy to read and very informative!
