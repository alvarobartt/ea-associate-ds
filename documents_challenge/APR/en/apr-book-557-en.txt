i found this book interesting and very well written. i've solved the issues and personal reflections that interest me much. different hypoyh√®ses addressed are very well presented and accessible to a non specialist. although it seems obvious that a human is a whole and that can influence beliefs about its author does not force anyone's hand and even if the tone is sometimes a little "controversy" it remains unless this book provides a palette proposals richer than what we impose the usual scientific press. i recommend this book to those seeking an alternative doctrines in place to imagine something a little more original, why not address the need for meaning that is in us.
