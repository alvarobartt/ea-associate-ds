here is a spellbinding album and very enjoyable beginning quietly with "cardinal song" could pass for post-rock as smog or evoke tindersticks (the singer's voice resembles that of stuart staples), before continuing in a register just over muscular, eyeing the next house of love. the melodies and arrangements of guitars are sought. a little violin and a beautiful female voice accompanying complete charm.
