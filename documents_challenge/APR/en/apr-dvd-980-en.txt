the old timers in any movie adaptation had to be a total success! the book by rené fallet which was the basis is one of his best with this delightful story of farmers who feel too old for their time and decide d 'walk to the hospital, combining the road drunkenness and pranks of boys. adaptation supervised by rené fallet itself dialogues michel audiard, jean gabin, christmas, christmas and pierre fresnay: the team! alas! .. we obtained a film ultimately disappointing incomprehensible dialogues (between the poor at the time and forced accents and outrageous actors) and the frame stripped of some deep emotion and enjoyed the book. at no when you do not feel the inspiration of a audiard not convinced yet of famous actors, including pierre fresnay struggling to play a countryman with little to convince. in short, too disappointed by this adaptation, i can only advise fall back on the eponymous book, frankly succeeded him.
