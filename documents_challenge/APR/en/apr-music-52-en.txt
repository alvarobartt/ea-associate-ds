the great circus of rock &amp; roll needs idols: gwen stefani is the latest blonde hollywood while (grammy awards in martin scorsese) tore. it must be said that for his first solo album, former doll ska-disco bland no doubt has surrounded itself to minimize the risk of crash announced (after all, gwen neither rebellious sensuality of a kylie minogue or the glamor of a madonna, or the talents of singer-dancer of beyonce): andre 3000 of outkast, the neptunes and dr. dre, among others, are the guests of this trip solo very well produced, to cover the very lachapelle. the ad title, the famous "what you waiting for?" is a hit in heavy rotation, irresistible listening to the first, boring after the second: all the fuss, these colors, these mixtures (pop, hip hop, r n'b, neo disco) are quickly breaking the coherence of an album a little flat, scattered tinsel as the grand bazaar in california, but quickly boring, unfortunately.
