what interest have the torture of jesus? if you are christian, we know that the greatest pain of christ is moral because it is supposed to take upon himself the sins of all mankind. so why the deluge of blood, this parade of sadism? to make us believe that christ suffered more physically than anyone? nobody would have suffered more than him? one would think ... unfortunately human history, from simple starvation to death camps, full of martyrs often anonymous. we have treated the anti-semitic film, one wonders why. where anti-semitism in history where jews put to death one of them? do not bother looking for the wrong reasons demolish a bad movie. just let it sink into oblivion right.
