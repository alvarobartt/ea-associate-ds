oh it is a long time since pure reason revolution (already qualified as group "new prog" very innovative) used a rock-influenced wilsono-gilmouriennes ethereal. in this opus, though the group has lost none of his daring, exit the influences mentioned above. the sound here is more concise, heavier, and more eyeing the side of sound across the rhine as the good old music of his majesty. perhaps a little too much so, that could lose the fans more "traditional" of prog. for me it is certainly a major album this year, which i will not fatigue (as above what) even if the color is very different. we find, however, all the ingredients that make their genius searched melodies, elaborate construction, harmony of voices (albeit with a chloe alper chouille least this one but a much better overall production). - misfortunes: a french title for a piece effective which set the tone. rhythmic hypnotic, electronic sounds and chorus entrainant. - victorious cupid: a title in the vein of dark third, metal version. very good progressive metal. prr as we know them. - keep me sane / insane: wonderful interlude to the next song - apogee / requiem for the lovers: piece progressive par excellence, a safe bet. - deus ex machina: my favorite track, pulling a little on the indust. just perfect. - bloodless: title quieter story to rest after the slap that was taken by previous titles. a little later new wave of high quality. - disconnect: vocoder, electronic sounds, another sweet album. - the gloaming: the longest of the album. varied, progressive, perfect. by itself it justifies the purchase. - avo or acronym for amor vincit omnia. the piano, a synthetic rate, and a second part darn effective and haunting. and if, as the album says, "love conquers all" (amor vincit omnia). let yourself be conquered by the courage and the mastery of this group who is constantly pushing boundaries.
