it is not enough to be a fervent amado, or being a lover of the sea to enjoy this gem, but simply to revel in adventure stories (like the picaresque novels in the 17th century) . judge for yourself: who is this old sea captain who comes to settle in the brazilian resort? is he really who he is or claims to be, commander of a thousand adventures (all possible, but all may be well imagined) or is it a storyteller that we will try to confuse, by tracing its true (or supposed) son's life full of candy in and attending any place of pleasures, and whose only merit is to have all the money he wants to be able to buy what degree of master long course? stories that follow will find an outcome at least inattendu.et how not to be seduced by the discourse of the narrator whose personal history intersects with the other two? and when we have the talent of a jorge amado recount, describe the company, to enter any situation funny, or to ridicule when it was the eye of an amado to penetrate, despite a veneer humorous, soul and feelings, then we write this masterpiece deserves its place in all libraries and not only on a few shelves of sailboats.
