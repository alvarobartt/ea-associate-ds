but what a disappointment this album! where is the e-street band? really no magic in these securities (with perhaps just magic). that search, all titles are similar, the boss is really tired, no energy, no passion. we must make a clear, time of born to run, nebraska or excellent track is finished. another criticism: the recording quality is absolutely horrible! it searches, is drowned in a din of electric guitars, you can not see anything. the voice of springsteen is back. i was so surprised at the mediocrity that i asked to change the cd, but nothing was done, it is a devastating record. and yet i absolutely sui fan but after this album is last time i buy the last springsteen eyes closed.
