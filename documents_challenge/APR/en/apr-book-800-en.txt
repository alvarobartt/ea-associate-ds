i looked for another series to read after reading the 12 volumes of the royal assassin that i loved. and i fell on the iron throne with his good judgments. i'm on page 60 and i find it totally impossible to get into the story, too many characters to be different and i intrigue me lost completely. the author goes much too fast for my taste, it does not have time to really show its history and its characters. almost every sentence contains a new name or new material fact, i can not follow. maybe he should continue to find more interesting, but personally i do not think i'll make it.
