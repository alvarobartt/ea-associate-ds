i myself am suffering from this illness and i feel hurt by this testimony. what conceit and snobbery to describe what the symptom that we are are so many to suffer. the author is so narcissistic and imbued with itself and i just hope that this book does not tarnish the image of mainly young girls like me sick ... a huge difference, however: the author admits cliarment no longer monitor therapy - which is not my case and the conclusion of the book is clear enough in the end: it is not and will never be cured. i am sorry for her and at the same time i want him to give such an image of people - so-many with this disease. besides the style deceptively simple but really bombastic. short to avoid as literature but also as documentation of this disease so serious ..
