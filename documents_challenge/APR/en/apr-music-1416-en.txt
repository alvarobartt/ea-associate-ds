on the 4 cd "offered" by crystal ball there is just enough for a proper album. these songs are really just outtakes, and this is just interesting for the diehard fans. the good news is that the album's spell costs more than 400f (internet only, or in specialty shops on order) and now it is divided by 3. for fans only
