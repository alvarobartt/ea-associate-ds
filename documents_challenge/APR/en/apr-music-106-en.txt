what joy to listen an album as passionate about what you can deliver the rock n roll when it is well represented, the freedom to be what it is .. this disc is like a cold floor of winter, the flat plates like the netherlands and overrated as the croisette of cannes film festival. the songs are over-worked in this studio that gives no color to the product, the song is next to the plate but very very good re-working too. it sounds like a beautiful note which slides into a wallet producer. i do not recommend this product to those who kiffent rock'n'roll, it could make you cry.
