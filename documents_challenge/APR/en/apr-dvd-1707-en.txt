that is a movie which my daughter 21 months immediately hook: it is taped to the tele completely absorbed by elmo! catchy music, funny and dynamic characters, ernest and bart are "reassurance" from time to time when the film becomes "difficult" (elmo tries his security blanket, so it's hard!), a short film really well done. both for small than for large! clearly better than others i have seen also sesame street.
