so happy to finally acquire the first episodes of sanctuary on dvd i was extremely disappointed. several episodes are massacred (missing scenes). is it censorship or just a botch job? yet the same scenes were well spent on tv! other than saying the dvd out before they could review the translation is really rough. the sound is not good, either. i much preferred a japanese version with subtitles. i do not understand that we not take advantage of the dvd to offer a more original version of the french version.
