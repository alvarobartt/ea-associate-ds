a romantic comedy bittersweet, one of the first not to sacrifice the blue flower and daring conventional dissection of the phenomenon in love through a couple classic. it is a little "war of the roses" more than twenty before, trashitude the less perfect and more psychological subtlety. everything here is transcended by the legendary audrey hepburn in her signature role: playful, delicate, passionate, loving, but a rough diamond of life and light constantly threatened by the triviality of everyday life. beside her, albert finney moderates sadly becoming the archetype of the upstart who has exchanged bitter his antics against mercedes, costumes, parties and an ambition of madman. it is a great movie, warning, hopping, gay into disillusionment, always leaving, besides the countless vehicles (cars, tractors, boats, etc.) are ingenious pretexts to ellipsis, constant jumps in time allowing the story to progress on three temporal units which are all moments the couple's life: innocence and passion in the morning, and disappointments of middle age abrasions, gentrification and acceptance of the evening. the film is so loaded with style finds it impossible to count them. the finding of a trip to two is the inevitable compromise in response to the terror of loneliness, but also as a palliative to the refusal to see wrecked more ten years weaving the couple, regardless of the events were experienced. so it is quite realistic, but without ever abandoning a strange optimism: how the flattening of the equation of life, through dialogue hot, allows an end passion smooth, full length accepted with a smile of clairvoyance.
