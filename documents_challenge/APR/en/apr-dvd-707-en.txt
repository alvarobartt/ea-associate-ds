released in direct-to-video, this movie had a bad reputation. the reality is even worse. despite a cast honorable (christian slater, stephen dorff), the actors do not believe for a second and you can not blame them. there is no story, no direction, no atmosphere, not even a drop of parody that might give an excuse. in paroxysmal grotesque, the characters are drawn in black, adding a little rock to the stage to give the conviction ... and the audience falls asleep. it's really bad and it is unlikely that the producer, writer or director will have thought a second. it was to make an adaptation of games for the principle of making an adaptation. hardly worthy of a tv movie. lovers of horror movies, fantasy movies or gothic atmosphere, go your way. you save your life 1:40, 1:40 profound boredom. there is nothing to pull, not even a scene. the only consolation prize is the music video entitled nightwish "wish i had an angel" in the bonus.
