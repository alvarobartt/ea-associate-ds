a film unfortunately more than ever on harassment and racial discrimination which we are witnesses or victims in this society based on competition and which completely ignores human values of others! a disturbing scenario remarkably well done and a perfect film brings us immediately into the story of this film but also through the masterly interpretation of the actors. a movie not to miss seeing! and that ends well thanks to the determination and love.
