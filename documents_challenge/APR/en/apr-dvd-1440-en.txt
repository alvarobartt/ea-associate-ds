i know there is a book of this film but i do not want to read it. why look better or risk being disappointed when we are so pleased with a work like this? humor, lesson of life, an atmosphere that makes you want to visit brooklyn ... is one of the few films that i can switch back to loop endlessly ... that is a film that feels good!
