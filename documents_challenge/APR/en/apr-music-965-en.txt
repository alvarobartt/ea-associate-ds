the collection jazz in paris complete the reissues of these recordings by henri crolla. the guitarist, a contemporary and admirer of django reinhardt, sign here takeovers tunes, popular songs, cornflowers or air music hall mode with jazz accompaniment of full orchestra (strings and brass). the result is borderline jazz arrangements are unoriginal and these pieces are quite disappointing. other beaches henri crolla expressed solo on his guitar are much more moving and convincing. they are unfortunately in the minority on this opus. the disc is completed by records in which henri crolla sing and obviously it was not his thing. overall a pretty disappointing album from the few solo tracks. it is mieu listen henri crolla in other recordings of the jazz in paris collection.
