a model? not a real album, the first group of hanover in 1972 already included the fabulous singer klaus meine and the genius composer rudolf schenker. this album is especially appreciated by fans of scorpions i'm gone for the first time (this does not rejuvenated me) with lonesome crow we bathe in full psychedelic vibe riff but some are already indicators of turning hard rock that the german group does soon to negotiate with brio. an album that exudes a true atmosphere (strange, disturbing ...) with little means.
