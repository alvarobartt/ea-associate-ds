subtle aura of the solar wind magician eno, piano and minimum air of harold budd raises nothing less than your soul across the cosmos, in fingering pregnant sweet melodies of melancholy appeased and timeless. pure moment of grace, at once elegiac and collected, "the pearl" the aptly named acts as a sort of poetic matrix of infinite space open to your imagination that you will be grateful to offer such blooms opiate ahead relentlessly. music for contemplative and dreamy that i invite to leave quietly captivated by the delicate scent of liberating eternities. if it is elegant and sleek, a benevolent light nostalgia, the music is as disarming simplicity. it welcomes as naturally as "gymnop√©dies 3" of erik satie and i swear that this relationship is not daring (for those who love like me, you can go listen to the wonderful "voices" by roger eno brother). curiously, this collaboration between harold budd and brian eno did not find the fullness so inspired with the very good yet "plateaux of mirrors" recorded several months later. a moment of grace, i tell you. there are plenty of music occupying totalitarian space, it offers you. i wish bon voyage fans of dreamy naps and fertile!
