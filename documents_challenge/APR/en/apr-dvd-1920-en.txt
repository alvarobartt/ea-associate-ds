i have not seen the other dvd as live wembley and skin &amp; bones but one in hyde park is terrible. the stadium is full, the atmosphere electric and the sound to match our expectations. from the first song (in your honor), dave grohl puts us a slap as his voice is the rdv (not like deftones (love her though, i have the full) with the singer's voice live is below power level / quality compared to cds). finally all the big hits are here ( "best of you", "hero," "learn to fly", "times like these", "monkey wrench" ... etc.) and ends on an intimate moment with the public "everlong" to the grand finale! what genius! dave's great!
