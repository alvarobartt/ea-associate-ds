the staggering metamorphosis of a man becoming a wolf. "the werewolf" allowed lon chaney jr. (son of lon chaney, great star of silent films) to gain a place in the sun hollywood. originally, bela lugosi had been seriously approached to take the role because of his interpretation of "ygor" in "the son of frankenstein" (1939), but is this due to a script or changementde studios tjrs they did not forgive the crime of the hungarian people for "frankenstein" a few years earlier? i do not know, there is always that what could have caused his return to perfection served with lon chaney jr. the emergence of extremely short bela does that make us want above all not miss the scene in question. as for the film itself, the story is very well put together and interpretation of lon quite impressive for my taste . do not talk to claude rains, still a top talent sober. the change from a joyful man tormented victim is one of the great success of the film (thank you again lon). the forest covered in mist, and screams add considerably disturbing atmosphere already oppression by the subject and the pervasiveness of the curse. it is really unfortunate that during the years that followed lon will be lost in this role until saturation and in films more and more desperate to mediocrity. luckily we are pleased to see other interesting works of fantasy, i think mostly eapo series in the 60's, but also in the gangster genre ( "running scared") and western ( "the river our love, "" high noon 3 times "," the scarlet tunics, "" the mission commander lex ", her final three alongside gary cooper, no less). like bela he will experience a slow decline that will fail to stop. but the "loup garou" despite the many remakes and copies is a work of reference which has been dated correctly.
