before seeing this movie, i never read books by eric-emmanuel schmidt (and since i have read elsewhere that 2) ... but i really thoroughly enjoyed this movie. firstly for those players, catherine frot is breathtaking, his sidekick (sorry, i just lost his name) is brilliant in depressive writer and gallery of characters who revolve around them is hilarious! the soundtrack is very catchy what a shame it is no longer available! in any case, i recommend this movie as a remedy for all the little blows blues everyday ...
