i never really was beaming this author whose nickname spiritual or religious fanaticism often ensnares the pages of his books as to make them indigestible, naive or simply stupid. with this book to be pretentious, it allows the reader to reach the heights of boredom and frustration, through an autobiographical history due to which any person equipped with a little common sense, it is ie not as fanatical as himself, can not bear any credit or even the lesser pilgrimage intérêt.le alone this book is made by the reader as each page is an ordeal that approximates its goal the last page. in my case, i gave up ten pages before the end and ripped the stack of paper bound in a great relief.
