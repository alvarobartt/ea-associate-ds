the idea of using the same pronoun throughout the novel to get into the skin of characters, in my original taste although it is sometimes difficult to navigate. on a holiday and in an atmosphere of light one finds serious issues that are now part of everyday life (thank you news) such as rape, homosexuality, infidelity .... i find it hard to understand how mr. blondel has managed to convey all this in so few pages but the result is, in my opinion, very satisfactory. indeed, it is with great pleasure that i come "direct access to the beach" twice in two days because after a first reading (yet careful) i found myself wanting to correctly identify each character. i therefore conducted a second reading armed with a sheet and a pencil. thus, such a puzzle i have restored all after isolating each element with its position but also its identity in relation to the other which was not always clear at first reading. the whole point of books like this paradox to be written in the first person to leave the various characters speak. the "i" m has somewhat disrupted and that's just what i liked. one thing to regret is the price! the originality of the writing is paid dear, i shall have gladly add to my personal library.
