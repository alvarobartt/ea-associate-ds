some songs stand out, i think: - mr bellamy - vintage clothes - only mama knows - dance tonight - the end of the end, but they are songs without great ambition, to the rest when it means to see some mediocre songs and i think that when we called mccartney can not afford to make songs like this (when we see what he could 35 years ago, it makes you think). do you let by fooled by the 4 or 5 stars, it does not strictly true. a 5 star for me is a cornerstone of the music, a great album (ex: band on the run from the same author), and when one compares band on the run in memory almost full and that remains the same range graduation ben memory almost full is well worth its 2 stars neither more nor less. ps: macca'd have been able to make an effort for the cover because the typography "mistral" ac which you wrote the songs back, well i word on the same.
