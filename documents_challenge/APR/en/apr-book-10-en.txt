i say no to ease ..... and not to the author who has not even made the effort to meet the family before writing his book, which knows nothing of the character gregory and even less artist !!..... how to speak correctly someone we never met in his lifetime, and which no one was interested until after his death?? frankly the place of the author i really ashamed of wanting to enjoy the pain of fans! if you want to read a good book on gr√©gory lemarchal, rather than buy his sister leslie "my brother, the artist" and plus you jig your good deeds, since everything is fully repaid to the association gregory lemarchal!
