the sound of this album is horrible. dynamics too compressed, bass heavy and too strong, sharp and saturated rough. his general featureless (it sounds like mono) and distorted. how a producer can laugh at this point the ears of his audience? this is even more scandalous than the music itself is not bad at all, if we manage to go through without becoming deaf.
