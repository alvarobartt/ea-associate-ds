rudolf herter, a writer whose family history is reminiscent of harry mulisch himself is traveling to vienna and speaks in an interview on tv the character of hitler. the next two little old for a retirement home for the contact to deliver their terrible secret the f√ºhrer. readers of harry mulisch know his obsession with the 2nd world war, nazism and the holocaust. it starts here on a risky idea, he reveals in the middle of the novel. by discovering what it is, i'm worried because some people are too symbolic events too emotionally charged for us to venture to play with or without disappointing shock. my fears have unfortunately proved unfounded. there are some interesting philosophical reflections on the origin of evil, on schopenhauer and nietzsche. by cons it is heartbreaking to see mulisch fall into numerology for concierge (chapter 17) or inventing a highly artificial plot himmler (chapter 18). readers of the discovery of heaven appreciate the parallel between the death of max delius guess when god's presence and that of rudolf herter guess when the presence of evil. for the rest, h. mulisch, which has demonstrated in other works his intelligence and his encyclopedic culture has gone astray. to visit and reflect the character of hitler, i recommend instead the share any of eric-emmanuel schmitt is infinitely higher.
