michael mann sees music as an important support for his films. so he gave us on the sixth sense, heat, collateral revelations or the beautiful creations bo alternating pure sound .. and again on miami vice, mr. mann serves the house / techno music cuban piece "love" but the least we can say is that this selection is, this time, though uninspired. the whole is clumsy, hard to swallow. only two tracks (one of moby) placed at the end of album save us a profound boredom. fans of mr. mann will defer to the old bo mentioned above and will demand the return lisa gerrard on the next generation.
