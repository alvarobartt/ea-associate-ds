after the excellent the bends, radiohead was expected at the turn of the 3rd album. where the bends proposed a collection of gems pop / rock of rare beauty, but ultimately fairly conventional format (verse / chorus / verse / chorus), ok computer was the lead a lot more experimental rock, exploring new areas unknown to the common rockers even downright unexpected. one thing is certain: never critical, whether or popular media, have been so unanimous on the quality of an album. and yet, ok computer had the effect of a ufo at its output, not like anything that had been produced so far. and the real feat achieved by radiohead was making this record unlikely, a huge popular success and commercial success that will determine also the whole course of the band's career that almost everything can afford, as publishing albums electro-chic, boring and without limits real commercial potential (kid a and amnesiac) or an album exclusively (or nearly) sold on the net (in raimbow). but until this relative decline in 1997, radiohead seemed as touched by grace. and the magic of ok computer still operates more than 10 years after its initial release. the listener is as hypnotic in this work and findings of abundant small flashes of brilliance scattered throughout the 12 tracks. paranoid android is undoubtedly the most representative title of the album, a single unlikely over 6 minutes, divided into 3 movements. a monument. the ethereal ballads exit music and lucky are pure marvels while subterranean homesick alien, let down, karma police and no surprises affect pop genius. with this album, radiohead clearly opened a new field of possibilities for a whole generation of budding artists , updating a new musical dimension never before explored. to my knowledge, it still awaits the next, can she exist ... this collector's edition offers a second cd compiling b-sides and rarities and a live dvd. a beautiful object to discover or rediscover an essential album of the 90s.
