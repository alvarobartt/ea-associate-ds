this is the dvd of a conference. very well done, interesting for people who do not know of any haptonomy, can explore this technique with great specialist ... for cons, do not expect a dvd guide that would give more details on practice or would do sessions at home alone without a professional. this technique requires the help of a specialist, psychologist, doctor or midwife. a test!
