the book captivated me, i thought all the scenes, display all the characters. then it was my disappointment in discovering this very bland adaptation of the thriller yet stunning. the plot is not met, the characters move from one scene to another without knowing how, key passages are forgotten, the great moments of supension passed to the trap-door, and what about the end part qqu it is a reflection of the film: tasteless and disjointed. only good point: jean reno is perfect in the role of niemans. maybe if i had not read before rooman, i loved the movie. but after it's impossible.
