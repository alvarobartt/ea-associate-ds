having been tempted by the reviews, i expected a really successful novel. so i was very disappointed by reading this thriller that has nothing really new compared to the great classics of the genre. the strings are rather large, clich√©s abound, the unfolding of the plot is fairly predictable and, therefore, we are bored. only positive point: two heroes rather endearing. but i will not read the other two installment of the trilogy.
