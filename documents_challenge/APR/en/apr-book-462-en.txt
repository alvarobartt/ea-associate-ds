i missed very quickly patience with juliet and her moods! juliet was a brilliant young woman who seems to have sacrificed life and promising career to a self-absorbed husband and two children bulky! but i wanted to pound the novel, but i was not expecting what i found -at least at the beginning-i stopped quickly when she decided to cut their hair, the hairdresser that lives like a drama and as a critical decision in his life - well yes it is symbolic, but anyway! - i found this so early caricature and unlike anything else, i did feel any ounce of humor, so i decided to throw in the towel! but it pleases you, perhaps!
