this is another small collection of books "to explain ..." at threshold. and, again, i was not disappointed! it is a very good book: clear, precise and concise. it should also be read by many people. indeed, this book asks us, teaches us many things ... it is not exhaustive but the author has successfully addressed, it seems, most of the subject (the concept of culture) in a simple and in an attractive form: that of dialogue that includes us directly in the comments and leads us to think.
