after a very promising beginning, it quickly in the dark and weary disinterest. indeed, it is early trained in the turmoil of world war ii before they are quickly planted by the author. therefore successive few "adventures" not sufficiently researched and therefore without interest, verging on trivial facts. as at the end, who wants moralizing, it turns out to be dull and are deeply disappointing. in short, a very mediocre novel, far from the magnitude suggested by its title.
