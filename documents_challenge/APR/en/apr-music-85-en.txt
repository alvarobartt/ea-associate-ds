we feared that our second album "chavette people" favorite, between the inspiration of exhaustion and fatigue of the "concept". it was not wrong, but the main disappointment of "it's not me, it's you" just where we did not expect: a production of a bad taste badge superimposed layers of synth to the physical disgust of the listener, finding even the emptiness of his 80's to highlight the strength of synthetic beats that pop too sweet. yes, despite 4 or 5 good songs stubborn (we are far from no fault of the previous album!), despite the texts often relevant, even brilliant, this disc is a cruel disappointment, the harsh reality of suburban london is now carefully hidden after effects "bling blings" not honoring lily allen!
