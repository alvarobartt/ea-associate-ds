despite some weaknesses, "river" is a great disc. a great jazz album. hancock succeeds where he had repeatedly failed. create a sensible world, a homogeneous disk, despite the presence of singers not always inspired, it is the success of this disc. and the weaknesses are of secondary importance. this disc, since i received it, i'm tired, i return according to my mood, with some pleasure. because somewhere disks "perfect" irritate me. it is endearing because it has some flaws. it is rather rare.
