so we could imagine that phil collins was superbly negotiated after the "but seriously" and the turn of the 90s with the relatively successful "both sides", his latest productions are not up to his talent and what one would expect from him. already "dance into the light" was very average here is even smaller. except (there it is not mistaken) the single "can not stop loving you", no title emerges and while this is clearly not unbearable, it smells already heard a thousand times and boredom quickly gaining ... damage to book only to fans. i suggest those who want to discover the work of phil collins to buy the best of 1998 "hits" or obtaining the wonders of the 80s "no jacket required" and "but seriously".
