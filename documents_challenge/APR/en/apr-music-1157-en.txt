listening to kid-a had a little cold ... i was wondering what to go like the following. i was a little disappointed. a year later i think these are my favorite albums. all to say that even if some aspects of hr songs may seem strange at first, gradually they release this charm, this way of "making strange songs" ... for example, "like spinning plates" could very well have been a simple song with solo piano. on the contrary, and there they are safe, they put everything into question, make sounds mechanical, electrical, who rajoutent in emotion, poetry, beauty. this song must be the most beautiful i've ever heard ... only small flat: "morning bell" would have done better out as b-side because this version is far less pretty than the last. this album serves to show the transition between okcomputer and kid-a. we therefore expect to see the group continue their search for complexity that makes each song is a kind of musical journey.
