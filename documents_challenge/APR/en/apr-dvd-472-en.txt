a review without counting. perfect. this volume 1 as follows. only fault-haggling: the sound quality often below, with a few strokes of knife-soundtrack-dialogue, especially in early times (each film is generally cut by 2 fixed-screen "the untouchables", d ' where 2 times per film). for everything else: the perfect black and white (as actors, plans, etc. ...).
