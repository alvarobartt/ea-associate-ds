the summary is taking the cover beautiful ... but the story boring. the plot is based on the murder of a young homeless, lianne and another wealthy woman, philippa. it seems to be interesting. yet the story does not give us want to know the murderer, that we are completely indifferent. the writing style is boring, there are too many irrelevant enumerations ... this book is flat, it lacks suspense, mystery, action, all these ingredients that make a book a good thriller. we read in a vacuum. the protagonist kit is too naive, it lacks character. in the survey, it found links fetched. in addition, the player can not participate in the investigation, and i find it very unpleasant. i very well could stop the first hundred pages, it would have been neither hot nor cold. i'm not at all interested in this novel.
