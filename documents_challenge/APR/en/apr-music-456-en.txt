coldplay has become a huge group. everybody recognized after their second album. however, there is probably a problem throughout this machine, because coldplay has no stature to confront whatever that means. evidence to listen to this third album the horrible bag. the band chris martin signs here his worst album. an album very "80s", which mixed the good and the bad, the synths, the theatrics, and the pseudo-lugubrious atmosphere. "parachutes" was a pop album full of tubes, and exquisite ballads, "a rush of blood to the head" was a very successful second album, tighter and deeper, too, and "x &amp; y" turns out to be a third album winded, superficial and predictable.
