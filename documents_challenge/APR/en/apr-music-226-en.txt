and yes, no doubt, this new opus muse sounds more and more mainstream. listening to the first title on the airwaves, "supermassive black hole", my ears are clenched so the guitar is purified. a drum has replaced our dear dominic howard. when the bass, it has little presence and buried among a multitude of sounds appliances. the beginning of the song is reminiscent of the prince (a wink?). one wonders if muse is always our group pychédéliquo rock-opera that made us dream so much ... then comes the first listening the album and the ensuing disappointment. the titles are linked, and despite some catchy ( "starlight", "assassin"), emotion is not the appointment. muse tries to even the house on "map of the problematique". only takes a piece out of the game, "knights of cydonia," on the end with a guitar riff very effective. i think a return to sources is required. in conclusion, this new album has everything to delight fans new and everything to disappoint those that follow from the beginning. nevertheless if we fall in objectivity and not subjectivity of a fan (my case) is an album rock / electro that could make a box. what it's going to live?
