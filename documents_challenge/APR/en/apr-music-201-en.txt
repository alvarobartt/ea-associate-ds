it is tempting to store this "fork in the road" at the top of the pile up over the years by the many uninspired albums that loner product for less generously. around a confusing concept (the car as a symbol of american freedom, or the car as the destruction of the planet ... er, all this is not very clear!), neil broods few chords and bluesy rock on songs generally dispensable. overall? yes, but it remains here and there some magical flashes of inspiration, and across a raging energy and vachard which is more (long) of his age. and for that, he will be forgiven much!
