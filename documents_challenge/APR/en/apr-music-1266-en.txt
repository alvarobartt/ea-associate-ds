fan always, here 10 years that johnny made studio albums without interest. "besides, only 2 to 3 new songs are the repertoire of performances, and fortunately! this new album is the sheer variety you hear every day thanks to another "camel" and was even entitled to a rap! help !!!!! we must stop doing anything mr hallyday. why not sing "snipe" or "captain future". the artists complain of illegal downloading, but frankly, an album like this is no better.
