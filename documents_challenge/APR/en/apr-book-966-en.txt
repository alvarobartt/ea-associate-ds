presented as a virtual manifesto of protest by the press, "as the living dead" is rather disappointing to this point of view. the original idea is really excellent (the dead continue to live in a sort of parallel world of the living), but the sauce does not always (at least not with me). for cons, the most surrealist of us enjoy the adventures of the heroine in his sixties, through which the author rule altogether some accounts ... a book with more informed among us or the fans of will self?
