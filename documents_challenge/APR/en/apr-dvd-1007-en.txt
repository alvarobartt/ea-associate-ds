it is the melodramatic story of a woman whose budget for her wedding has been so beyond its means (the stepmother has borrowed from a rich usurer), the whole family over three generations will spend his life repaying the odious creditor. punctuated by hard work (for info, it takes a kind of soc on the poster) and drama, honor and respect are core values if they are pushing the woman to the irreparable ... 800 movies out each year in india, and so little in europe. but as it seems that only a dozen a year really works there, much to feast the best here ... mother india (1957), which i had never heard before its dvd release, is the classic of classics "bollywood", the absolute reference, clear the "gone with the wind" from bombay. although it is difficult to adapt to a long kind of format (almost 3 hours), difficult not to be fascinated by the beauty images in technicolor, magically weathered by time, music and timeless songs (these are the same today). here, no room for kitsch and bad taste, it is really a drama, treated with all requirements of the genre. in zola's fullest, no time for romance and lovers. this heroin will never know of respite. a remarkable edition, with the excellent idea to offer the press of time, illustrated with frescoes ecstatic, and dutifully listing all the staff. wow, this is a movie!
