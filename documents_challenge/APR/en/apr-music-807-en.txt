what a beautiful album we have released the counting crows! the album starts off to-wheel with, probably, as most of the rock band's discography: "1492". the other 13 songs on this album is that tubes in series mixing quality, style and inspiration of 2 of their albums in particular: recovering the satellites and hard candy. for connoisseurs of the group, if you liked those 2 albums cities you'll like (no doubt) it. for others, why not discover this great band with this album?
