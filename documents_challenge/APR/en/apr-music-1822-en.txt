lack of originality is felt for this producer we were so surprised with innovative rhythms and sounds shifted. here, the songs come and go all alike. and none has the wealth of songs from nerd chad hugo ( second neptunes) deficiency may be the album. especially since pharrell at the microphone, it verges on farce. the rhymes are pretty poor, the flow rather feeble and falsetto becomes frankly agga√ßant. there's even all the stereotypes of hip hop today ( "angel" is a distressing stupidity). speaking of cliches, is not very surprising to find nelly, snoop, and other popular rappers. very few good elements to allow the album to take off. two to three titles can be distinguished, but it is fashionable to ask: when the album shifts to 10 months is to improve, right? ahhhhh ... mean that the cd was worse than it originally ?????
