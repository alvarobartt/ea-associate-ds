showbiz delighted me. talented and beautiful songs. origin persisted, we felt some difficulty in renewing itself, but citizen erased or micro cuts - which for me highlights of this album brought me a good feeling music. the turn of the 2nd album is never easy to negotiate. absolution definitely get me angry with muse. too predictable, too noisy - it is time to pass the crisis of adolescence - too boring, just leave the same impression: a sense of deja vu. so yes, certainly since the time they begin to master the formula, but there is absolutely nothing new, no risk taking, it's all too easy for my taste. it is far from being questioned by radiohead, rock dropped from deus, the breath and the maturity of sixteen horsepower. without denying the fact that they are very very talented guy. the other surprise, what are the lyrics. bellamy password may be 8 hours per day on his scratch, both on the piano - technique, technique when you would like us: it is not an album, it's a manual! - but how long is he then to write lyrics? maybe 5 minutes on the bus before going to the studio ... this is only my opinion, of course. but after all that much mouth, words do not matter. if you do not know muse, it's still an album proper, it is certainly more than 2 of 5. but i expected so much from them ...
