at a time when programs now require elementary school to study art history, not just art in isolation, this book is a veritable treasure of prehistory (bison on propellant) until at pop shop art of keith haring, the book draws a historical journey of art suitable for children. for each work, a meeting was proposed to his explanation, a meeting at his imitation (how to), a meeting an activity stalled. and if the "how to" please do not, show the illustration and explanation only after your own session! finally note that each work is reproduced in color at the end of the book. so still a work saey particularly useful.
