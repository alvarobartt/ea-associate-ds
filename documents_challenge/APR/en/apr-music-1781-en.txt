each song of this album is really excelente. the problem is that they should not be put all on the same album because it's really boring to listen too. should enclose the true song style red hot. the one wonders what flea as bass lines has 2 balls he gives us are not worthy of his talent. despite the beauty of some songs this album is unlistenable.
