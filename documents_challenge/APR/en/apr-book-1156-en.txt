on the death of his father, maria merryweather left london with her governess to settle the manor of moonacre, his uncle, sir benjamin. the latter greeted with warmth and attention, and the girl immediately falls under the spell of his new environment, although it is happening very strange things. his uncle himself seems to hide many secrets: why did you it not the right approach merryweather bay or pine forest? why no women tella set foot in the mansion for more than twenty years? maria discovers that a curse hangs over his family for many generations. released in 1946 under the title "the little white horse" (the horse of money), this novel is a classic of english literature, recently adapted film (hence the title change). it's a book tailor-made for little girls: there is a princess room, pretty dresses, and fabulous animals (a huge dog, a cat very clever, a nice horse, a hare, a unicorn .. .). the whole does not lack a certain charm a bit dated, the characters are endearing, with special mention to miss heliotrope, the governess who suffer from terrible stomach aches, and twirling cook marmaduke scarlet. unfortunately the set has many faults: a tremendous style, especially in the early pages where everything is "joy", "magic" and "wonder", endless descriptions, a story a little stale and too predictable. this cute, full of good feelings, but if you have more than ten years you might get bored farm!
