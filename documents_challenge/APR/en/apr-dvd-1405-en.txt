three little turns and then leave! a dvd that can be happening without remorse. terminator 3 is the t2 refilms less well. there is nothing new in this sequel. we wanted a journey into the future and see the machines in their cruel universe (glaglagla, i fear), but no, we did a city tour, a ride in the countryside and after blowing up the earth, and we leaves the open end (in case).
