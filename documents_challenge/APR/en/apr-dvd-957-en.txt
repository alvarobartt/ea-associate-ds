a romantic comedy very funny and so light! compare the sexual behavior of men than of cows, is a very original idea! it was daring! it includes an ashley judd (the collector) very active in seeking the truth about why men can not even keep a single cow, oops! woman! greg kinnear a very mooo! and hugh jackman (x-men) who flees the love ... we understand the plight of people who are dropping, who want to understand at any price, why of how the theory of where the cows and men! in particular do not take seriously! this film is both funny, funny, half fig, half grape ... good film at all and no dirty tricks!
