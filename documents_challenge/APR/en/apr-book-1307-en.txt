true love letter / rene fallet friendship with georges brassens. a book which i have long awaited the new edition. thank you to denoël to have emerged and have added excerpts from the diary of rené fallet. i forced myself not to read everything at once and to limit myself to a few pages per day, as eating chocolate ... good photographic illustration.
