although i believe that alan parker is an excellent and skilful movie director, this film is a mixture of unbelievable racist plot and full of blasphemy targeted to the turkish people, therefore this movie is a shame in parker's successful cinematography, and also for oliver stone ( script). there is no good turkish people in the movie (???) and imaginary middle age (?) atmosphere of prison is set in a 1970's turkey.
