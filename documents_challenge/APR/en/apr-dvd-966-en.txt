the film is unfortunately a shadow of what it might have been. in addition, a (bad) old. this film looks like a brilliant summary of some 3 or four novels by frank herbert. the atmospherically is perfect, wonderful costumes, the plot well constructed. unfortunately, two hours and some are not sufficient to account for the richness of the work. disappointing.
