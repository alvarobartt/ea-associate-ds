intuition is a process of making extremely fast and efficient. in a split second, you give your opinion on something that deserves careful consideration. in short, you know, without knowing how. the author addresses a very interesting but i think it does not present a good way and it misses a lot. indeed, the majority of the book is composed of stories, anecdotes and all sorts of experiments proving the effectiveness of this unconscious process. the authors do not matter and only show in what circumstances intuition appears and does not offer methods or advice to "stimulate" intuition. despite some original stories, including the experience of pepsi coca-this book was quickly stowed in the closet.
