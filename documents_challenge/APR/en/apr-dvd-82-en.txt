and yet, i do not know whether doubling con is sufficient to describe this thing ... i did not expect such a failure! it is all almost a textbook case ... the film had a bad reputation, but i still say it was one of the many exaggerations and attacks free and easy criticism ... and although we are almost in understatement for what has already been said. how can a talented artist as gad elmaleh could also spawn a movie nullissime? already the main character is wildly unsympathetic as totally and permanently selfish, egocentric , narcissistic, superficial and extravagant in the extreme. then the story is nonexistent, there is nothing, but really nothing nothing! the gags are zero, almost all failures whether in their writing as in their implementation scene. very rare are the moments that make fly ... finally the general interpretation is appalling, ged elmaleh actually tons, mill hands in the air, and many of the second or smaller roles are so poorly chosen that it's embarrassing ... a film to flee, really to flee, until mr. elmaleh found a film to match his talent ...
