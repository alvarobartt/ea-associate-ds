what a disappointment! after a first opus longuet where questionable aesthetic choices in both sets, the costumes or even the "photograph" showing the work in its worst aspects, after an encouraging second film in which (if one eliminates the two tales of love horribly staged), the character of gollum caught everything, so here come the conclusion of volume. what a disappointment then. all through the worst are amplified: in cardboard scenery, actors operetta (which mess to see players like bernard hill is ridiculous) a sterile assembly (the scenes with tyler is a way summit nanard subway or edward scissorhands d ' money), special effects superabundant at the wrong time, in short ... asked grace to an hour and when the end comes we should be wondering how anyone could be to find any interest in the matter. and hop, one takes a little conan, a small highlander, a willow or even good old peplum for real nostalgic cartoon version of lord of the rings and there were the real "epic" of the true breath of 'indestructible or all overflows (so paltry when compared to those of jackson, who has yet to gems like heavenly creatures, which i sprobablement one of the few hundred fans i are 10 years sentence) become endearing flaws that increase the marvelous adventure.
