after 2 excellent opus, this third (and last for raimi) gave me a feeling of complete botching. you feel the weariness of the director in the action scenes with epilepsy, history and incoherent editing bloated. the scenes where sam raimi and his actors had fun, however, are excellent: peter parker drunk by the powers of the symbiote sham and packs the girls, little respite between 2 shots heavy on redemption and compassion. the script required with 3 villains (perhaps most vendor), reconciliation with osbourne, it's all too much: it is seedy, quickly passed and ridiculous. still 2 good movies, and ensuring that raimi and tobby mcguire would lend their names over to a future result, allowing us to avoid another flop. sam? a little evil dead ac would do you good ...
