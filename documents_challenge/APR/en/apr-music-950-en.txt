metallica was one of the greatest thrash bands, knowing digested his influences and mixing rhythmic and harmonic innovations without sacrificing power and violence of thrash. they have invented their style. they also presented as rebels, standard bearers (sometimes extreme) anti-rock-bizness. and then metallica has aged, mustaine long gone, the great cliff, bassist and brilliant musician is dead and metallica (post interesting &amp; original justice) has released the black album (which was not even as in reality). poverty afflicting a musical! a tempo excessively softened and unified and joyful and full entry in this rock-bizness preformatted and conformist as the four hoursemen (the nickname of false rebels they gave themselves) claimed to hate. this album is a funeral. metallica is dead with this disc. for it was not a mishap but the beginning of a long series of deceptions, cd musically poor, slow and soft, antitheses of thrash, marketing formatted with the complicity of glamma bob rock (sic! too funny nickname !) producer bonjovi (which metallica had often laughed before!). if like me you loved the richness and strength of the 4 previous titles, this cd and forget all the following. i have listened 3 times in full, not 1 more, each time with more disappointment, more difficult to go after more of sadness about the terrible conclusion: this album is worthy of its name. by cons, if you discovered metallica later you please perhaps. that said i put a star because they could not put this album at least long, slow, empty, monotonous, tedious, which, if any more of thrash is not even good heavy metal.mÃªme title and cover are null and conspicuous by their absence. this album has no more title than inspiration. cliff back kick their ass ( "we're gonna kick some ass tonight" they said, what irony! where how to spend thrash trash. nb: trash without h = garbage rican)
