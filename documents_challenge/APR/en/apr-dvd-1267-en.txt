dead silence was produced and directed by james wan, one of the creators of the movie "saw". the influence of the universe "saw" is blatant from the generic and the mysterious and unhealthy atmosphere that prevails: we find the famous "puppets" with evil powers and donnie walhberg (inspector in saw 2) is also present. the special effects are stunning, the animation is remarkable dolls as well as photography and film music. and yet this film is not good: lots of incomprehensible flashbacks, heroes and a little endearing script written without conviction makes "dead silence" bland and boring. look at the series instead of "chucky" or other "puppet masters" if you want suspense and excitement. this horror film does not deserve a place in your collection .
