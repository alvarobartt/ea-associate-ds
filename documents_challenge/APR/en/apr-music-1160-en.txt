already the single was the blatant plagiarism of talking heads (re-hear "road to nowhere"), the rest of the album is a ressac√©e clumsy pop-folk of the past 20 years. those who loved dylan in their youth will love it, find it pretty cool, but for me it's the soup lukewarm. + the funny thing is in the 3rd phase of the single "in the morning": "every music on the radio sounds the same ...". how ironic ...
