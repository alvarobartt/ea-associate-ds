yet fans of the cycle of sword of truth, i was disappointed by this volume. it happens almost nothing throughout the book, goodkind dragged long history in rehashing ever known elements ... despite all the style is still taking, so i quickly read and i certainly read the following, hoping there will be a little more action in this one!
