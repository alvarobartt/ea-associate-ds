i do not think this work is an ultra-violent road movie, "tarantinesque" and leading nowhere. the indices are numerous in the film suggest that this history in general and the psychopathic killer played by bardem in particular is an allegory of violence characteristic of texas. indeed, it often exists in france a uniform vision of the united states the personality of each of the 50 states that compose it is very strong and the state of texas is often associated with the image of a country historically farmed (and culling ...) cattle and cowboys ready to draw. this state is also still in the winners head as regards the rate of homicide and use of the death penalty (which had obviously no deterrent effect ...) and recently the texanne law still has "liberalized" the use of firearms in the case of an alien intrusion into private property, even if it presents no direct threat to the occupants. so i think this tradition of violence for the defense of private property (the briefcase with 2 million in the film) is illustrated here by the coen brothers. violence embodied by the character bardem whose behavior "ghostly" and indifference deal with victims, the weapon of choice (the tool of slaughter cattle in compressed air), the "peculiarities" character "immortal" i seem to be sufficient evidence to understand that it is a allegory. this is further confirmed by the final comment of tommy lee jones evokes history have lived like a dream. perhaps therefore work to review a 2nd time? ...
