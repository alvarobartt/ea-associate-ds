rather disappointing book based on family relations, few scenic descriptions and few human encounters! but critics on the lifestyle abroad rain! a negative image of the french has been sent! some pictures inside the book corroborate my statements (mostly photos of the camper). but a positive point: the adventures are told with humor!
