excel 2003 the complete guide is a book which, unfortunately, does not live up to its claims. the book that presents itself as a comprehensive guide (see title) is really useful in the early chapters. indeed, the entire capture and manipulation of data reveals both interesting and useful for the beginner. the chapter on learning the key functions is also a great help for anyone not yet comfortable with the syntax and symbols operators. now, when moving to the achievement of scenarios and pivot tables, the reader remains in the dark as complete as the authors seem to have taken the party to think that the first is already quite aware of what kind of achievement. thus, they seem content to refresh our knowledge in a quick mention of this functionality offered by the spreadsheet. the last chapter on what can be achieved by using macros and vba, the reader emerges from this chapter also virgin knowledge that is entered. the authors speak of the code in question very briefly and add to the confusion, we present a table showing "the use of tabs in the code" of the thick (p. 585) who completed the novice to drown. the basic instructions are in vba, for their part, flown by boeing as a "list of commission" and, again, do not tell us anything. we therefore leave this book with a sense of unfinished learning leaves us pensive about the veracity of the title of this book ... to conclude, i would say that this guide has helped shed light on some manipulation of formulas most used but left in the shadows many other points which might well have been 'be explained and developed.
