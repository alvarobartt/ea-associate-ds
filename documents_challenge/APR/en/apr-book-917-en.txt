for fans of dennis lehane, of indridason, e. george f. thill, i say "do not buy this book, it certainly led to a hellish pace, which allows to put improbabilities that could go unnoticed. everything is predictable, especially the end. i'm tired (fortunately i read fast).'d like eventually to a young person discovering novel called "policemen". go rather to discover "the woman in green" of indridason: it's downright awesome!
