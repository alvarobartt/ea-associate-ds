in 2008, the bookstore shelves since the success of "harry potter" which in parenthesis is excellent and restored the joy of reading to children and teens are full of fantasy books. it is the fashion books as historical mystique since "the da vinci code." there are good, at least good and everything. i did mention that good writers (tolkien, the ursulla guin, marion zimmer bradley, robin hood, raymond e feist for "faerie", david gemmel, moorcock, mary gentle and others.) the two best (personal opinion) are ursula le guin and robert holdstock. going back to volume 1 of the forest of mythagos, huxley's family lives in a mansion near ryhope wood. the father, in his diary tells of his ballads and his explorations in the little wood which only a few hectares, but which in reality is infinite. one of the son, christian sees ghostly beings that materialize. he falls in love with a mythago called guivenneth. upon returning from world war ii his junior steven perceives the mythagos and falls in love with a new version of guivenneth he created. volume 1 this is exciting. the volume 2 "lavondyss "albeit with a very good start, and skips a generation less interested in me (too much padding). personal opinion. the volume 3 "the brouissaille password" is excellent. it tells the story of a boy alex attracted by wood. it contains suspense, action and mystery. the volume 4 "the ivory gate" tells us what really happened to christian in volume 1. it is not bored for one second. the heroic fantasy lovers will be delighted. i'm sorry but if i tell you the four opus in detail, i have two pages. all i can tell you from reading this wonderful cycle is that robert holdstock due out in england in late 2008 early 2009 a series called "avilion" which will resume on volume 1 and loves to tell steven and guivenneth. happy reading.
