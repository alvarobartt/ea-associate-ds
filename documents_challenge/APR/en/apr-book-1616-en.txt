i find it heartbreaking to return to the stage of reading for a film that can see and feel and not by others but by oneself. this book is a disgrace to the cinema of david lynch! to know that david lynch himself does not return to the stage of writing after filming and made the film, i think the fans should do likewise. i'm not at all like the book and for me it shows a 'i know i was there, i saw' em ' "invaders".
