rene aubry is an artist you may know without knowing. indeed, his compositions are often used as background music in some tv documentaries. it is also for those whose style of music did not match any other and can not be compared with that of other artists. the main instrument used - classical guitar, because there are no vocals - is a new way. other instruments are added and complement very well the compositions in high demand. so an album that i strongly advise you to listen!
