i have great difficulty understanding the success of this book and rave reviews that i read on the site. the starting point of the book is a sham: it presents a concierge "smart and educated" who pretends to be an uneducated fool and harsh to fit with the image thrust of the caretaker that he then used as an excuse to throw the tenants of his building on the grounds that he take it for what it seems ... the book is full of scathing remarks about how "down with the rich, and poor grades ended up putting uncomfortable and prevents them from developing a genuine empathy for the character. it is a very manichaean scheme, where the rich have "cockroaches in his mouth, and when the housekeeper is an aristocrat" in the soul ... while the concierge certainly many prejudices that those she criticizes. we must add that during the first 100 pages it nothing happens and it just suffers display indigestible knowledge of the author (she suffers of complex?), and the thinking "deep" of the 2 main characters, which give rise to an anthology of passages more or less philosophical. when the character appears to ozu, the story finally starts. but we enter a sphere totally unrealistic, full of highly improbable situations, especially since the author does not excel in the construction of the psychology of the characters. you end the book really perplexed, thinking that no 'there is no tangible link between the level of sales of the book + the price of booksellers, and the talent of the author + the value of this book, in short, something of a sham ...
