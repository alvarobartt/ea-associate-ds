the future eve villiers de l'isle adam is a blow against scientism prevailing at the time with auguste comte. and paradoxically it is a book of science. science and mystery and even mysticism. a book that reads like a catalog strangely like a manual. it is a book that surprises so in style and especially his remarks. a book that does not seduce or to please. a book that seeks the truth, which is creation. it is the major work of a visionary seduced by the contribution of science when they revert it. a book that calls beyond the mundane sciences, and who rejoices his power of fascination, magic, strength. an inconvenient book.
