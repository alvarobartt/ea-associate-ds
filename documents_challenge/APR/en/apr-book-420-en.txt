i bought this comic after reading the comments posted here and i do not regret it! i am also 5 stars, so i found this excellent album (and the next one too!) the "cycle cyann" has 4 albums, but the first 2 make a story that is sufficient unto itself. on a planet resembling to earth, where water appears to have much importance, cyann olsimar is a young girl belonging to the ruling family. she is beautiful, intelligent, even if at the beginning of the book seems to do everything to get into trouble, perhaps especially to relieve the tedium. everything is good for that: sex, of course, to the death, but also the challenges and stupid paris, on the edge of suicide. it is the common lot of all that idle youth. the power seems to be shared between 2 entities "source" and "probe". i say "seems" because no key is given explicitly to enter this world, that we discovered as and when 'history. this is probably why some have difficulty with the beginning of history. the opposition between the "source" and "probe" goes back to the war ends, and ends when the story. indeed the time has serious purple fever decimated the population, and medicine can do nothing. an expedition to the planet ilo, colonized during the war, is mounted to bring a remedy, if any. old daughter named olsimar cyann responsible for shipping. will tella up? a world teeming with fascinating detail and a beautiful design with carefully chosen colors, engaging characters, adventure, love: everything is there. the next "science fiction, space travel, etc ... is soon forgotten: the heart of the album are the characters, and cyann nacara top. a very good album to own!
