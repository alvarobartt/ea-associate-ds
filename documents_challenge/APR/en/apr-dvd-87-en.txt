this film tells the true story of a father and son falsely accused of committing a terrorist and who spend long years in prison before coming to prove their innocence. it is a work of great strength, fully and honestly overwhelming, indicating that police excesses can lead the fight against terrorism. but it is especially a beautiful love story between a father and son, two men who learn to support and esteem through the tests they must pass. filmed with accuracy and truth, they are for me a lesson in courage and proof that the human dignity that we deserve to fight for it. finally, this film is perhaps not as successful if it was used by actors as remarkable as daniel day-lewis and pete postlewhaite. features absolumment but not for the sensitive!
