bully can not be ignored ... larry clark shows us an aspect of american society that is not allowed to see every day. the young actors are really brilliant (special mention to michael pitt) and the story is simply amazing. when you know it is based on a true story! i dare not reveal too many episodes of the movie, just know that if you like to be shaken, bully you will think long after the credits.
