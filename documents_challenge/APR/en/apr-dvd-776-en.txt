sensual erotic thriller that makes you all sweaty in minutes views the "proportion" of the two heroines, and those of the beautiful don j. (that of miami vice) for the ladies. it glaude, stifling, it happens in a corn palm, between vain wicked and unscrupulous. the end is quite pleasantly surprising, not too moral, but mostly it is a soundtrack to your breath away, combining for one and only time miles davis and john lee hooker. good thriller.
