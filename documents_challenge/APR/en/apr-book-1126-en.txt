driven, almost hypnotized by the whirl of the first 100 pages, reading ends up being more difficult. the book fell from his hands. a feeling of disgust comes quickly and is growing in the flood of details morbid, perverse and obscene. it tries to convince himself that can happen, we will read the pad until the end, to indigestion. we finally look over the pages, which may well make this book a so-called "masterpiece". then, we find his free will, its lucidity, its distance. we then realize the deception, and it finally gives up. to me, it was page 435, anyway! it is as if, after being knocked unconscious by a punch early - unless this is the most effective media manipulation ... - we found his spirits. just grogg, we see then that was wrong. they mocked us. the author, criticism, media and some intellectuals mocked us. we realized we were trapped, which is embroiled in a major unpacking scabrous and despicable, pure voyeurism, which has nothing to do with the "great" literature in which the book claims to belong.
