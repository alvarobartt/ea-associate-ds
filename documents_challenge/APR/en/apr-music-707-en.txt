aaaah ... morten. saying that cm1, the girl i love only had eyes for him. 20 years later, i want my revenge! i will speak ill of his solo album ... :) seriously, i love a-ha (some albums in any case, not only out of nostalgia) and i think morten has a beautiful voice. but do not crank it too far. his first solo album did not impressed me, and this "letter from egypt" mawkish fails the same way. private talents of composition and paul magne morten only knows how to do that sugary ballad. frankly, i preferred to speak well of this record and i enjoy listening to loop one of the most beautiful pop voices of the nordic ... but no. we can still marveling once again about the purity of the voice of mr. harket (despite the age and limits that accompany it) and recognize that this disc is beautifully produced, but it does not. despite some beautiful melodies and arrangements successful, you're bored. it's soft and sweet, it sounds a bit "tacky" ... emotion does not, however, an embarrassed smile or sarcastic is emerging steadily over listening. it is far from the success of last album a-ha "analogue", he published almost 3 years ago , which shows all the know-how to pop our norwegian friends at a time when coldplay or keane others take center stage. if you're looking, listen rather magne f. or (to a lesser extent) savoy, another group of paul. there you will see where are the good songs from a-ha. for this solo effort, perhaps success is it possible in some homes. we can also consider this album as a lullaby for a newborn or as elevator music ... you think me too harsh? was not stung me my love of cm1! go 2 stars anyway ... do not ask me why.
