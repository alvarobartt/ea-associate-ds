finally a new album of the beautiful vanessa! since that time waiting! to divine idylle, vanessa was again surrounded (and more than ever) very big names in french music: mathieu chedid, albin de la simone, thomas fersen, franck monnet alain chamfort, brigitte fontaine, etc.. but she also wrote and composed his own songs. as bliss, divine idylle is an album "family" found songs for his children: "jackadi" for jack and "the sound" for lily-rose (who did a drawing on the album). the cover is a beautiful painting done by his friend johnny depp. note that this album only contains songs in french, unlike the previous one (whose very title was in english). this magnificent edition has two albums: one with cds and lyrics, and the other, the studio sessions, with photos taken during the recording, small postcards to vanessa ... the songs are very varied: some are dynamic as "soon as i te vois "or" the battle ", and others all sweet as" junior suite ". mathieu chedid has done a very good duet with vanessa on" batteries ". my favorite:" chet baker "and" junior suite " two songs are completely different. an album to listen, purchase and re-listen. go see live as there is space, is to live at least once in their life!
