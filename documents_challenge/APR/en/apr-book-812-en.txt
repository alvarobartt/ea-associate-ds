my mother gave me this book for my birthday and i must say it was an excellent choice. xinran spoke of chinese women whose testimony it received or which he spoke was when a radio host on nanking. china is certainly changing in the book by xinran are discovered appalling conditions during the cultural revolution. this book moved me a lot and sometimes even cry. i advise everyone to read.
