i am tempted to order a dvd but fixing bad ratings ... the best ratings are bogus or not they are just manipulating the clientelle to simply fill their pockets anonymously? "i do not deny at all fact that positive ratings are very much more numerous, but why the negative feedback, although fewer, fall in total contradiction with the positive ratings?! so what i'm looking for is not found at any street corner, i feel more tranquil then buy the product after having considered as in any ordinary merchants and thus escape the scam!! my position is in no way a criticism but rather a statement of fact ... otherwise why such negative reviews, why so disapproves? "i hope to have a response or reaction as soon possible.encore thank you for reading until buddhist and understand my foundation.
