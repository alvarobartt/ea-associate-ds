hey, i want to clarify that the 5 stars are for the script, acting, music ... brief for the film itself. the main problem with this dvd is the sound which is quite low. also be aware that it is in english without subtitles. this film tells a part of the life of mesmer, the father of hypnosis, a doctor who would cure everything, and he refused to accept the suffering of men, he wanted to help, whether poor or rich. he has given body and soul into this work. ridiculed, banished, he never gave up. was he right or wrong? up to you. the talent of mr. rickman is further proof, he plays to perfection mesmer. this film is not unlike a smaller scale (for smaller budget) the piano lesson.
