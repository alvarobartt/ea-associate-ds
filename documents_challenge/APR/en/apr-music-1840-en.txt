since their inception, the bearded trio we had used to a good blues album. after an excellent "deguello", came out a year top, zz top gives us a "el loco". it starts with "tube snake boogie" with his track traffiqu√©e his percussion and guitar that sound too bright (it is a good way). but the rest is more doubtful with "i want to drive you home" or "heaven, hell or houston. not to mention the horrible ballad "leila" harbinger of a wrist fm ballads that the group will deliver on the following albums: "eliminator" and "afetrburner" in mind. basically if you are a fan of the band's early work as " tres hombres, "" first album "fadengo!", "rio grande mudd" ... it is not please you.
