the melvins ... a myth going, let us not mince words. before nirvana (kurt cobain loved them and knew them), they turned punk, led zeppelin, captain beefheart. really? and if the melvins were the group's new van vliet? stag is not their most obscure album and it deserves the noise disturbance that will not fail to cause your neighbors. the heavy (the bit), the arty (soup), rhymes with scare (skin horse), the spectrum is wide. for the melvins have to shovel ideas are very good musicians and very good composers. for those who are not afraid to shake their ears, which are used to stuff crossed (as fantomas), stag is both welcome and a superb card.
