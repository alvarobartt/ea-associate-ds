i had been disappointed by fiddling made by george lucas on star wars to mark the dvd release, but thx 1138, we enter squarely in the scam. digital special effects were added, the whole plan, even without any warning, not even in the so-called "making-off". this is especially outrageous that the interests of thx 1138 was (originally) to be an experimental film of sf on a budget, a true auteur film. restore sound and picture, okay, add digital beasties to trade, it is shameful. i said that i had the chance to see the original film in cinemateque ago 15aines years: i speak knowingly. moviegoers, do not buy this dvd.
