finally! the reissue of this disc is really made to wait (i was lucky to find him in september on amazon england) ... this live (1978) that for a closing time collaboration group (kaukonen / casady), i think, one of the best group (although it competes up close with "america's choice" in my heart ) or one of my favorite cds! (tied with "happy trails" by quicksilver ^ ^). jorma kaukonen begins with a single acoustic part (of "winin 'boy blues" up "killing time in the crystal city" through the classic but wonderful "embrionic journey "acclaimed by the public) and connecting directly to the rock / blues, backed up after the quartet unleashed: kaukonen (guitar), casady (bass), steeler (drums), buck (piano). "i wish you would", "extrication love song," "talking about you" are a perfect example of the best blues-charged to the hot tuna particulieremnt be noticed on this album version "electrified" from "genesis" simply prodigious , same for "serpent of dreams" back on a slower tempo, with a low attack, very "dull", which immediately puts in the atmosphere of one of the most bizarre songs (in the text) of kaukonen (one of the most beautiful too ^ ^) ... the other songs are taken from the prev studio album, "hoppkorv" where jorma kaukonen officiated at the electric guitar with strong accents "wha-wha" he leaves here for his good old gibson ... (it is said that 'there are several versions of the disc at the total time i listened to the 33 turn, it is true that intros and applause of the public have been cut) in summary album to have for any fan of hot tuna or any fan of blues rock that respect! you will not regret it ^ ^
