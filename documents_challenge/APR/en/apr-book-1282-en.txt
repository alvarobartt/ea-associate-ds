i wanted to read irvin d. yalom because it was recommended in the press. i chose this opus by his subject: "a psychotherapist at the edge of death, searching for former patients in order to depart in peace." we all think about this unchanging truth: one day we will be more. the book gives some ideas being considered (purely atheist) but it is not at all dark or depressing, instead it focuses primarily on "how best to live his life." besides, history is primarily concerned with psychotherapy and group character development among its members. the plot is interspersed with biographical passages about the life of schopenhauer and beautiful quotations from the latter, which appear throughout the evolution of group therapy. "schopenhauer the method is a simple book, which does not hesitate to return the concepts discussed, i particularly liked the presentation on schopenhauer, which is ultimately the most fascinating character and the most spellbinding of all the novel. as for the least of this book, i would say that yalom knows about philosophy, psychoanalysis and knows its novel structure, but do not wait to revel in the beauty of his writing nor his characters, which are archetypes and not very endearing.
