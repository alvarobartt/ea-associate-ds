it's disgusting! a great band to end up like that, it's a shame! finally, i console, page, plant and jones have preferred to stop after the death of bonham, which has allowed the glorious zeppelin which was already the open-balled to stop before crashing miserably. but it began well, this disc with "in the evening" and its intro grating. but unfortunately, was the only good track on the album. "sound bound suarez" is not terrible, "hot dog" is missed, "all my love" is kitsch and repetitive "i'm gonna crawl happening, but limited. but it was also entitled to one of the worst titles music has never had: carouselambra. quite simply, robert plant does not sing well, jimmy page played badly, we will hardly bonham sound in this mush, only one thing is played correctly, the synth. but no good synth with yes, a synthesizer to sound deguelle, which dominates every 10 minutes of the song. the transition to 7'09 minutes is unlistenable. to avoid and never listen. buy coda instead, which contains all good titles of "in through the out door", including "wearing and tearing". in a word, the only bad disc led zeppelin
