i'll just tell you what i felt after watching this movie the first time: nothing at all! no emotion, no surprises, no thrill ... nothing! i did not laugh, and even smiled! but i must say thank you to andy garcia, who is particularly strong, as usual in this film that i would describe as "the greatest movie boat that we can make a break into a casino"
