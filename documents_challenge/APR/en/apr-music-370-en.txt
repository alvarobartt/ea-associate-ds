i feel positive about wanting to share his passion, especially opera. but mr. pagny forgotten opera that there are rules in contrast to the variety. it's good to want the dusted, but there are limits. there are still some beautiful tunes that we would be able to sing, but if they are not in our range, so they are not done for us! the composers have written for specific voice! the vocal side, mr. pagny still work! vive les studios and mixers!
