the 5 stars are obviously in the show itself, not the "multi channel" sound or the grain of the image that i can judge is neither a pro and a very recent fan of the dvd ... there is a concert absolutely perfect, amazing professionalism (i weigh my words), lighting effects incomparable to my eyes despite performances that allow the technology 12 years later. pink floyd the show certainly deserves the nickname "dinosaur" because inevitably it will crush everything around you ... "time" seems to me an extraordinary achievement and performance of the singers (as noted above item) is absolutely unique ... i've never seen anyone move with such fluidity and smooth voice of "low" (belly) is the head voice ... turn on the magic of wish you were here, which still operates and has jumped back on the penultimate "comfortably numb" whose visual effects are simply chilling (as said r &amp; f, neighbors should always be trying to cast ... ). the room is huge and occupation of lightshow returns the largest groups of rank makers sparks. the finale is grandiose, 3 cronies obviously pleased with the happiness they provide. if you add on top of some of the best tracks from each group (just a shame for animals ... but it's true that it must not be obvious on stage) the dvd deserves to use your drive. large screen plasma or lcd home cinema + rigor .. anything less would be disrespectful to the show exciting. a must.
