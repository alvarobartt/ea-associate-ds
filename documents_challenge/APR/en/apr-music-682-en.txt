jean michel jarre had been hard to start his career. oxygen is one of the great classics of jarre and electronic music in general and the only one i put 5 stars to share zoolook. the music is very beautiful, very harmonic and melodic rather simple. it is sufficient in any case to support the beautiful sounds developed by jarre and create an atmosphere soared in line with the theme. in addition, the disc shows a great range of possibilities of electronic music, including the sequencing and use of the mellotron. i regret a little the presence of the party will, at its very dated and melody more than mawkish. an excellent gateway to the world of electronic music of the 70s, then. only tangerine dream seem best at the time, but their music is much more difficult.
