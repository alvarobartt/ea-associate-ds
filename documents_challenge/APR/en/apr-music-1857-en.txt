memphis 1954. the city is at the crossroads between the road leading from nashville to texas, and one that goes from the delta to chicago. cowboys and mackerel found there. blacks and whites play music. long before this holy year for the rockers, it was already playing rock'n'roll. even before elvis, scotty moore and bill black, guys were playing hillbilly boogie and rhythm and blues. long before them, blacks played country songs and blues white resumed. but where these people did for entertainment and fun, the three lads, meeting by chance, announce the apocalypse. it is no longer a nice upbeat music but something where orgiastic love songs turn into a declaration of war. alchemy made between the satanic voice of the preacher hillbilly cat, the guitar playing dirty and full of slapback scotty and slapping bill black. the rock is an attitude that abolishes the dimensions pre-established between black music and white music. nuclear fusion is irreversible between the shuffle of "that's all right" and that of "blue moon of kentucky" who sound like when these two tunes come from many different cultural regions. "good rockin 'tonight," "baby let's play house" are hymns to independence. "trying to get to you" and "i'm left, you're right, she's gone" reveal all the fervor of an innocent person who is not even the king. as for "mystery train," where the paranormal song title does not appear in the text, written by junior parker is a ghost story train on which elvis and his cronies laugh and make fun of the rest. at the all-digital, these lo-fi recordings sound as fresh, vibrant and mysterious. beyond talent, there must be a dynamic, groove, attitude and commitment. these sessions are to listen as the tables of the law sonic rock'n'rollienne. yeah.
