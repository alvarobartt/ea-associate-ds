frankly i am not a fan of buzz k an artist uses to launch in the wake of his own album its so-called group. all this feels good work done by going faster and beats of the songs have an air of already heard (get rich ...) glance i did not like the style of 50 cent is good but should not be clairvoyant to see that his mates "rappers" have no talent ... but right after the girls love 50 because it is "beautiful" and newbies (newcomers to hip hop) will love this cd because there dre and eminem ... ahlala nostalgia ...
