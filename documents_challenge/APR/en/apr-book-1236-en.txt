the idea is to stage a historie about a miracle: the virgin of guadalupe appeared to juan diego. hence, four centuries later, a team of specialists returned to the scene to conduct various assessments. despite criticism that there had on this novel, i find the subject interesting. i do not feel that the writer has changed or altered reality. the church seems very mafia or fraudulent in this investigation. for the story itself, it is readable. i did not find writing innovative but not unpleasant. i did not know the history (that of juan diego and the appearance of the virgin) and i appreciated the more historical side and investigator of the novel rather than history that the writer has grafted around.
