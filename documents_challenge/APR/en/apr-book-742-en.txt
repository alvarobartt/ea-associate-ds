i am not a specialist of the genre, they lent me the book, but i can tell you that long ago that i have not read a book so quickly, not only because it is small. the intriguing plot (which is good for a plot) from the start by its originality, and it does let you go. frankly i expected to end a little flat, but it happens in an accelerating pace and shattered the possibility that we foresaw in brightness. fortunately the conclusion we can catch our breath quietly. it is a true invitation to discover the author that i did not know.
