in one of the scenes of the film, a young art critic told a ballerina just interpret causette opera: "if you victor hugo had known, he would probably like to be a choreographer." although not can think for victor hugo, i am sure that seeing this movie, he would like claude lelouch. it still and always gives the impression of letting his actors free themselves both in their role in freedom of aftershocks. michel boujenah, upsetting, responds to annie girardot no less beautiful. a delight film aesthetic, which is a credit to our cinema.
