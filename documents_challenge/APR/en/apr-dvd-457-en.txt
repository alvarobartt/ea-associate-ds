a masterpiece, really. this film deserves a dvd quality version. when was the difference vf / vo, warner can not do anything, the film was released in dubbed stereo. the original version was from the outset in 5.1 (jj. annaud was somewhat ahead of its time). this is therefore a collector's definitive version, referring to oblivion the pitiful previous edition of tf1. note, the commantaires audio and interviews from jj. annaud, simply fascinating and rich details. hooray!
