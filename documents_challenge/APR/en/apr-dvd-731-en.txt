adapting the work of orwell seemed g√©nialissime ardissime spot ... the proof is in this adaptation. even if it is not devoid of qualities, we can not help thinking that no, orwell should not be treated this way!. both babe (another adaptation of a book) goes well, as even if he finds some good ay formal (pigs dictators are rather well done), this farm is not adaptable! perhaps because it is a work too "adult" too deep. untouchable, indescribable visually (or when a filmmaker very inspired and original ...). this film is intended as a fun, yet the book is no longer the end un.de optimistic misrepresenting the book is a big mistake!
