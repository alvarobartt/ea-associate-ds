this is not the best movie with kevin bacon, or the best movie of ghosts. we allow well embark on this story, initially disturbing, but turns a little predictable, with a classic scenario. the "ghost" reminds a little too moaning myrtle from harry potter and everything ended up resembling one episode of x-files, so unimaginative. but the tortured kevin is the guts out and give some energy to the story.
