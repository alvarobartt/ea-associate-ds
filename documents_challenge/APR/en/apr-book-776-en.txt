"words d-day" is a collection of testimonies of both soldiers and civilians on d-day and those of the liberation of normandy. the selection of letters is remarkable. the impression that emerges is of an astonishing modernity and the reader feels so strongly the news message. this work sponsored by the "memorial de caen" is worth reading. the price is dwarfed by the quality.
