showbiz delighted me. i told myself, a little opportunistic, but let's be honest, y'avait talent and beautiful songs. origin persisted, it felt wrong to renew, despite citizen erased and micro cuts that are mons sense the great moments of the album in creative, the rest was betting on the re-showbiz. forgivable, the turn of the 2nd album is never easy. absolution definitely get me angry with muse. unless they are seriously question, i stop following them. too predictable, too noisy - it is time to pass the crisis of adolescence - too boring, just leave the same impression: a sense of deja vu. so yes, certainly since the time they begin to master the formula, but there is absolutely nothing new, no risk taking, it's all too easy for my taste. i let absolution to those who love, and return to placebo as to be crossed, much as it is for good. the other surprise is the level of words. bellamy password may be 8 hours per day on his scratch, both on the piano - technique, technique when you would like us: it is not an album, it's a manual! - but then what time is there to write lyrics? maybe 5 minutes on the bus before going to the studio ... i find them really poorer than ever, and this dimension of writing them as i always fail. but after all that much mouth, the words we do not care. if you do not know muse, it's still an album proper, it is certainly more than 2 of 5. but i expected so much from them ... all this is only my opinion.
