well, one thing is sure, dan brown shows that this is not worthy of a writer to lay a book that sells well. this book sucite comments fanatically passionate readers who dream of a fight with those of laymen who have not understood. not worth fighting for that, guys. that is what should happen normally (if the hype - well done the marketing department - was not as important): as we take the train, we'll buy a book (oh look, the da vinci code, i take me to pass the time) then we read, is not unpleasant but after an hour or two it starts to get bored a bit (move the code into the code in the code is laborious over time). however, as we still have 2 hours of travel, we concluded (ah, so that's it?) it was not unpleasant, but the train arrived, we leave the book on the chair and just down the car, we have already forgotten.
