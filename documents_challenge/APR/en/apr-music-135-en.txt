today, it is surprising that a "trick" has been such a market, but by inquiring about the date of manufacture, a sense of compassion touches us. 1967! actually, these guys have laid a ufo. both musically and commercially, we understand that this turd should have seemed so revolutionary it hurts. there is resulted: the entire album is like a repeat of college students abusing illicit substances. only the voice of lou reed holds our attention with its hypnotic power. this is indeed the first album of punk history, but do not cry to genius: it is a scam first. how is it possible the guy at the console could say: "okay guys, it's good! we care, that one"? with a sound as rotten solos as badly screwed, not riffs in place, and so on ... their intention was clearly to create the disc no longer possible and therefore make "anti-musical." do not like me do not slip on the banana skin of andy warhol. this disc is anything but essential! listen to television (heirs) and you've demonstrated you can be punk, compose his songs and play up. making music, whatever!
