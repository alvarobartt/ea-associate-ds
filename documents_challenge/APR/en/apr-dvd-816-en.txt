4 heures 10 film that is left to look forward to but too many shortcomings to be satisfied: the image part remastered (indoor) has no relief, fuzzy exterior, the dubbing in french is abysmal and the main actress is not at all pleasant to watch (we see her for 3 hours) or convincing. lack of pace in the staging, only timothy dalton gives strength to all (but the 20 years between the two characters do not see).
