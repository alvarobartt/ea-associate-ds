i loved the original trilogy came from japan, but then all! attempting to implement in a west was, indeed, a little dicey for the asian horror films are often based on the unseen and the unsaid for the viewer extrapolates, imagine his brief genere own fear (because everyone has a corresponding imaginary especially fear) and then, bah voila, we are shown murky visions of insipid, we sort of expication smoker but the scope of the less careful to keep us in front of the screen. .. that was scary in the original version, it was (among others) sadako faces concealed, with the sole concrete vision, one eye (visible from the 1st and the "0") inhuman forms to us inconsistent put on the road to imagine the rest, horrible, here we used the banal vision of returning to western as we keep up ... and we do not feel rushed by a reality that we had perhaps could not be imagined until then ... this is a brief example, over gore verbinski has tried to mix the 3 ring vaguely japanese just to make one, result, he abandoned a large part of the "why" unhealthy and disturbing, revel in ring 0, the benefit of a few simplistic explanation certainly consistent, but disappointing.
