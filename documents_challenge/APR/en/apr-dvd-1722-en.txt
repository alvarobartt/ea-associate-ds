for me spartacus is the best film of stanley kubrick point to the line followed closely by shining. it is a peplum absolutely sensational. from the outset, the director chose to tell a story that revolves around the characters and not vice versa. in contrast to many other peplum at the time, kubrick did not rely on staging large-scale, but rather sober. this enabled him to make a film much more intimate or emotional and human dimension takes precedence over the story itself. the psychology of the characters is also very worked (something very rare in the peplum).
