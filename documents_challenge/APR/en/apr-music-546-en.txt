what, no one has chronicled hello nasty? wait we are in 2003, this disc has 5 years (five years ... how it flies ...), and no one to say that it is an essential album. bon ben voil√† i said. sure, it is far from fight for your right to party and rap-rock of sabotage. here it goes over their instrumental compilation and somewhat experimental "the in sound from way out", but the flow of raging super disco breakin 'or the more roots three mc's and one dj brings us back to familiar territory. elsewhere we are treated to the novel, as the final mournful, minimalist instant death. just as long album, it is no less exciting, as it is diverse in its sounds like his compositions. an intro latino, big break-beat, a riff more rock you die, we find it all in one piece. and it's good. this probably means that the pouch. we see our three comrades trapped in a sardine tin open. crammed into their straitjacket rap, did they get the message "we go out of there!" ? anyway, hello nasty is proof in 22 bits.
