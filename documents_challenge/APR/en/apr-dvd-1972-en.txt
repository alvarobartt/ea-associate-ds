if you are a fan of the trilogy, go your way, it's filled with special effects, but the story is flat. the pace falters often. i prefer the result and not the past because we can guess what will happen? has to see the dvd because there are brilliant bonus. this will let you see but do not cling to the chair like in the old episodes.
