that is, record companies realized that neo sold well and then we are "bombarded" this type of band that pleases both young. i greatly enjoyed the 1st album enhancer, because apart from the plans "neo" hyper-known, there was some originality which was added at all. besides the sound of the 1st album was somewhat "rotten", but i think it gave a result quite real, raw, but true. here, the sound is just awesome, but that's all, there may be some titles that seem nice plays at 1st, but after a week you'll quickly turn and then this cd will remain in your cd collection without too much you never miss ...
