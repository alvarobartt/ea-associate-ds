here is a nice illustration of the fact that madonna, far from anticipating modes as often said, does in fact qu'accrocher its cars to the train running (not a criticism of the rest, just an observation and an update point). 1993, a little elf came to iceland is blowing a fresh breeze on pop with its subtle novel mix of pop, dance, jazz and world music (trip-hop what ...). the disc is produced by nellee hooper (ex-soul ii soul, which revolved around the galaxy massive attack). he must therefore hooper to madonna for her upcoming cd. and so to do, as björk. björk who resist the siren before release still a title ( "bedtime story" by far the most electronic song on the disc, and the best), while refusing to meet the american. for the rest, madonna, aided by several other collaborators, continues in the vein of the previous album (), and more "cool" but less oriented "dance floor". almost all the pieces are indeed syrupy ballads or securities "downtempo" a little soft knee and the disc will fail again. the first half of the 90s so difficult for the star but has the merit of revealing another facet, more introspective, a restart before the end of the decade (and album).
