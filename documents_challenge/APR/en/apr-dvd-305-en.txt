after many artists and intellectuals "engaged", george clooney tries his hand as a filmmaker agreed to register most of the criticism of the established order "conservative." it does not take too much risk and not s'originalise little by attacking the excesses already old and universally condemned by senator mccarthy, remained in our memories as the "witch hunt" (although it must seem to decrypt it implicitly a critique of the current bush administration ...) this episode moved the media in the fifties is certainly not very glorious to american democracy. with hindsight it is, however, derives a relatively minor considering what was happening in the country under the yoke of collectivism. in france itself, we have little to boast if one remembers the witchcraft trials which have marked the end of german occupation and later the case that kravchenko was the opportunity to welter worse intolerance. still, the film which clooney gratifies us is a very distressing trouble. shot in black and white, in a warm soft, smoky and talkative, he touched on the subject. it must be really knowledgeable and spare no attention to understand about what it is. the least we can say is that the story is flat and devoid of any suspense. at pains to point out some tone closeups well photographed and a vague mood music supposed to bring a jazzy touch to a well fade.
