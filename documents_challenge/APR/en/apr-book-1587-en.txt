a book for disillusioned life! an antiwar pamphlet of a hundred pages of fantastic (at first). describing certain social stratum (the "prole" and while many others) a fantastic way a little but if abused realistic ... i read a lot of comments and those who read celine have been disgusted blablabla, i understand why it is simply a very good book, it reads fast, writes almost as if the the author spoke in a rather boorish at times either. it's just an experience, a good dose of humor (often a book has made me laugh so much given the subject). it is true that the journey's end leaves something to be desired. me i read that i begin the journey and died on credit (in the galaxy the collection vol 1) have fun
