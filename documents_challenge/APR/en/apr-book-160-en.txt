"different seasons" is, including "misery," one of my favorite stephen king. this is a collection of 4 new distinct, with no other link between them as to locate their activities in the united states ... and all four are absolutely brilliant and unforgettable! once you're inside, you can not take off the nose! and once finished, you will hardly forget this book ... every story alone is worth the detour, there is not one that surpasses another. last - the breathing method - is particularly striking and completely closes the book. stephen king sign is a pure masterpiece (or rather four!) you shall not go free! a must read! note that the first 3 stories have been adapted to movies (the shawshank redemption / apt pupil / stand by me) and worth all the blow to be read to be seen.
