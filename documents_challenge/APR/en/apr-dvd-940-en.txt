i saw this movie 2 times! first, i found the correct film, a first half-hour rather funny, and the rest, rather boring. the second, i just smiled at first. and the second part seemed long and i even fell asleep. it's like almost in a tv movie of m6 (perhaps why it has pleased my mom!). no, frankly, good feelings, that's fine, but when it caricatured this point, it's hard to pass! so 3 little stars for the first viewing, and only 2 for the second time. really beyond what is masochism. i saw in kad jobs much better.
