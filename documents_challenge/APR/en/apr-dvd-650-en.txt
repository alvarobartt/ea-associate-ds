a fairly good thriller, nothing particularly new in the scenario, but a good pace and moods of night quite beautiful. but above all, a great julia roberts, with an interesting role, a presence constante.mel gibson himself is terrific in the role of semi-déjanté.bref, this film is a pleasant surprise.
