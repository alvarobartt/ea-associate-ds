i must first acknowledge that i am an ex-fundamentalist of metal that would not have given his chance as a group gojira no so long ago. because his speech and his concept explode too. moreover, had long been suffering from typical french syndrome of thinking that what is done elsewhere is necessarily better, i ignored albums gojira. telluric but benefits the group, including opening for groups statures internationnales (slayer motamment) shook me. gradually, the group and his honesty with his concept not easy to impose and i liked especially the concert at the 2009 hellfest has finally convinced me. so it's late i'm looking for gojira with his latest album. half of this disc i liked at first, and several plays, the second half proved to be interesting too. indeed, gojira plays with unifying the passages and goes inside, but also takes the risk of leaving beaten track. and the risk often pays in the case of gojira, because these guys just have the talent and now we can no longer ignore. that is why with this excellent album, i'm going to dive into the band's discography.
