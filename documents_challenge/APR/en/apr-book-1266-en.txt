one of the great classical work. sobriety. no verbiage. clearly, it strikes, it hurts. i recommend this book to teenagers for their training in "humanities". to think that this book was written before the second world war is even more disturbing. analysis of anti-jewish hatred is so relevant they would have thought that this book was written after the nuremberg trials. remarkable.
