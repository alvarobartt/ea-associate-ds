vandread is a very good manga anime while public. vo is for the initiated! of course, being a good manga, too interested .. but the great majority of young (and not so young) are unable to read the subtitles ... more ab's very seldom (maybe not at all) in the vo! remember the knights of the zodiac (saint seiya) and nicky larson (city hunter), the vo came much later, when the fans have grown! i'm sure, given the quality, demand help, other publishers (why not click) the original version released in full (fv belonging exclusively to ab) like ranma 1 / 2 or lamu ... one can mangaphile order and allowing the emergence of a new generation! by cons it is true that only four episodes per dvd, and say "full" for 13 episodes on 26 abuse is unfortunately becoming more common not only in ab! and prices have risen so scandalous past few years! but this is not the manga is bad, it is the publishers that we cheat! especially as the repeated passages on the strings ab have already written off the investment!
