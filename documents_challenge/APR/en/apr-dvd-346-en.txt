how can we make this nanar with such a subject? the atmosphere of wild and extraordinary place has been only partially and briefly presented. the exteriors have not even been shot in the gevaudan. the first minutes of the film are the only ones worthy of interest, then no problem it is better to leave (or zapper). the scenes of kung-fu set the tone, then the emergence of indian sounds the death knell. finally, the disaster is consumed at the onset of the "beast". the director had a choice between nothing to show (it's often the suggestion is most effective) or show some furtive dark and terrifying animal. the kind of kebab footed is ridiculous. finally came that make players of quality in such a farce? how pathetic. a movie (?) to forget quickly.
