some commentateuts evoke "matrix". i wonder why. "matrix" is a trifle for teens with special effects licked well, uneventful. you know nothing? normal, as in "matrix", there is nothing to understand. "equilibrium" is an excellent film political reflection on totalitarianism. as one commentator noted, we live in the orwellian universe. the action is exciting, worthy of a good thriller. this story is real. excellent.
