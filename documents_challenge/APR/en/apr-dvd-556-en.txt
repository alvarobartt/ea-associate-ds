big disappointment that the "podium" yet promising on paper. the gags and funny replies are too few, the film smoothly surprise his little music, before sinking into marshmallow and conformism (work and family rather than the passion and adventure) in his epilogue. ca lack of madness. remains the beautiful performance of actors, including jean-paul rouve in lookalike polnareff.
