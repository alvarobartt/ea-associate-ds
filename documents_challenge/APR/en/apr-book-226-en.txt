it is the story of a girl who goes in the north with the gypsies to rescue kidnapped children. these children have been kidnapped in experiments around a mysterious matter, the "dust." on one hand i found the scenario very well tied up "and i loved the inventions of the author : daemons, the animal totem associated with each human bears warriors, witches ... as i enjoyed the part depicts a 19th century magical and colorful. on the other, i found the style very "childish" without breath, without actual beauty. and chapters could almost be read independently, as stories to read at night. so yes, precisely, one might object that this book was originally intended for children. but in this case i agree with an opinion expressed here: i found this story very violent, both physically (dead blood spurting ...) or emotionally (children terrorized, tortured, dying in solitude, obnoxious parents ...). in short, contrary to some opinions also like what this book is for both adults and children, i feel it is ultimately not really for them, nor really for others. in any case, i do not read to my daughter as i had originally intended and i do not control the result.
