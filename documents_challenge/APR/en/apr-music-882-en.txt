when philip glass asked him, gérard manset he would record new songs? could someone describe the crazy music that could write together alain bashung and godspeed you black emperor? and if daniel darc had been invited on the new album, suicide, what would have happened? i often dream about the unlikely marriage of musicians whose roads are unlikely to cross ... and now two of my heroes out a whole album together! the mysterious french oslo telescopic already noticed in these columns in 2000 for their album into three parts (third / degree / burnt), boarded dominique a in a hybrid disc and wonder. by turns zany and dark dominique ø the project is rich in experiences. dominique a clearly likes to be in danger during impromptu meetings (we had already agreed with diabologum - known as john love (!) - yann tiersen, little rabbits, etc.). with oslo telescopic, he trades his voice, singing, humming or whispering his lyrics in languages more or less identified. impressive the latest songs give the impression of being a post-scriptum to stir.
