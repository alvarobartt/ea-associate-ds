juggling between past and present, the film tells a tale on the theme of lesbianism, wounded by the suicide of a young girl ... denouncing homophobia. the touch of fantasy scenario adds a little spice to the story, but this is not a horror film, horror as i could see the writing on several sites. it is a drama with a touch of "para-normal" ... a very interesting film, with young actresses all very convincing, and a realization that more careful. indispensable in its dvd-rounders.
