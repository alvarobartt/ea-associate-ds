two tracks make up this outstanding album, became a classic: "the creator has a master plan", long after 32:56 (registered february 14, 1969) and "colors (february 19, 1969). please note that editing meets cutting vinyl: "the creator" was split into two parts on each side. too bad for this cd release in the continuity of the piece is not restored (it was done for two versions of "ascension" and "om" from coltrane, for example). there is a japanese edition much more recent that can hear the seamless composition. in 1969, the style of sanders had changed dramatically from what it was alongside john coltrane: although still sounds incredible out of his saxophone, pharaoh game is much more melodic, lyrical, "thrifty" and already beginning to subside. the song of leon thomas is often close to cry and tried to compete with the acute-notes in the saxophone the most free passes (starting the second part). then the trance past, sanders plays the wonderful theme, using harmonic modulation and a beautiful vibrato. the rhythmic, abundant (3 percussionists are present), and piano (lonnie l. smith found out about other recordings for impulse, "thembi", "jewels of thought", "deaf dumb blind") gives the 'foundation needed to play libertarian sanders. magnificent. "colors" contrasts sharply: melodious, serene melody as suspended. 5:15 and when pharaoh sanders shouted two notes, the second place, one is transported by the emotional depth and simplicity of his speech, profoundly shaken by the justice and hope it carries. superb all points.
