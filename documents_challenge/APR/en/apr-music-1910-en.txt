this is not the group's best-known world, not the album of the century, but if you do not know, please. if you like maiden, motley crue, guns you love tesla. the great radio controversy is unquestionably their best. it is part of my personal top 10. it's melodic and catchy at once. the guitars are beautiful, the voice of the typical metal 90 ', the very catchy melodies. to be absolutely!
