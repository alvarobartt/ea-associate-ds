... but an excellent compilation! i have some album of tom waits from belgium, and i must admit that there are few that i listen in full: inhomogeneous, different styles but not always appropriate, uneven voice, sometimes irritating songs variously appreciated. but this compilation that includes early (tc matic) and ends with the extraordinary duet with bjscott (john baltazzar) is remarkable. and i even found a harmony that i did not all need in albums taken one by one. everything is good, atypical (as is arno): the duets, the choice of songs with a few forgotten nuggets, the words "not ordinary". excellent purchase that i believe can avoid the non-fan to get all the records of his extensive career. after all it is also here that here is a best-of!
