a book very comprehensive and interesting. everything is there. standards, different materials (iron, zinc, copper, pvc, pvc pressure, rip, etc.), tools for a complete or partial installation, the practical aspects ... are covered in this book the plumbing (arrival and drainage) and plumbing for gas. and taking into account the related issues and safety standards: electricity in the bathrooms, ventilation, etc.. it is clear, well illustrated (can often be limited to explanatory diagrams without having to consult the text which can be handy when you just want to quickly check something). the illustrations are very complete and very worth of photos that are usually more meaningful. all standards are taken into account. there is virtually no question that remains suspended when you read this book (which is rare because the newcomer still has questions or ways to interpret things the author has not experienced thought). in summary, it is very well done, complete, accurate, clear. of all the books on the subject that i have traveled far, he is unquestionably the best of its quality and richness. i highly recommend it. even satisfaction with the contractor of the electrical installation. the only criticism i have with this collection is not dealing with all topics: masonry, carpentry, roofing such are missing. it's a shame. all aspects of construction for the individual treated completely in a collection of this quality was a must.
