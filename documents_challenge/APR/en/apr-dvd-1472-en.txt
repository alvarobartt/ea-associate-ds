a great adventure: gregory peck is obviously not a cowboy and you wonder why he does not step back from the beginning. it is like we won by the girl (his girlfriend) and her friend, a little from the country. everything is symmetry in the film. young rivals: two with their respective girl friends. older rivals: two parents with their glory and their faults and their reflections in the young person. and also a map of the mirror symmetry with two people well (gregory peck and jean simmons), this mirror is not broken (accuracy) and the expected end comes after a number of massacres and disillusionment. the character of charlton heston is too quickly brushed my taste. some beautiful images and prosecution and clashes are very successful really liked this movie. plethora version and subtitles.
