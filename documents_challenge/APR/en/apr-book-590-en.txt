well, i usually read 1 book a year ... lack of time and especially by the ease with tv. but here i am 2 in a month. i started and after that i devoured and i got there in the christmas gift that i have just eaten. no problem for the first part but once the second part of the book started, plan to finish it later because i was unable to win and go to sleep before you know the end! very well written and addictive
