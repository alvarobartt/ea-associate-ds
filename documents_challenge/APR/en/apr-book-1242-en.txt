book dense and well illustrated. however, it remains somewhat unsatisfied, in my opinion, this book merely commenting on how to use the 500d, with reference (too often) to manual pages canon. (it should read two books at the same time ...). also, the author, who is a pro in photography, is too critical an eye on the 500d it continues to compare models pro canon (but worth 3 to 4 times more expensive ... same thing for the goals!) the result for the new owner of the 500d a sense of frustration on the one hand, you do not control the 500d, but it makes you regret to many pages and chapters have not bought equipment pro ... you satisfied your little cheap plastic toy and its modest features!) too bad, because the 500 d, as well as distance cannon show excellent high performance material for a connoisseur. i do not know the other works on the 500d, but ... you satisfied manual canon, this book will do nothing more.
