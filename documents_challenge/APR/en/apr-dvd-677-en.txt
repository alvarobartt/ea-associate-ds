i should have put two or three stars, but it must be tempered with all these 5 stars. this movie is far from a masterpiece! when i see the comments of some who say it is the funniest movie they saw! i think they were born last week! for those who hoped to see a really funny movie, watch is style "is there a driver to save the plane" or "hot shot" in much much worse ! voila you have been warned!
