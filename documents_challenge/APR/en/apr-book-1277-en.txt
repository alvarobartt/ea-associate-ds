very beautiful novel. jacquie d'alessandro has an ease of writing, an ability to create his characters, making them very interesting almost all live in a flawless, all for my greatest pleasure. i loved philip, an ugly duckling become a swan, exciting, very caring man. meredith is not bad either, although it lacks a little something. the intrigue surrounding the curse is superb and the final countdown keeps us in suspense. if you want to find some engaging characters to book, then read "countess affair", one finds andrew and we finally know who he is madly in love.
