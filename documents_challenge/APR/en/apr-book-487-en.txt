i just finished reading this book and really hard to bring back my mind the twenty-first century! you can understand that this novel is so vivid that it is very easy to carry in the very early years of our era in a jerusalem resplendent in shimmering colors and fruity flavors. i therefore strongly recommend this book to all those interested in ancient history and like to travel through space and time.
