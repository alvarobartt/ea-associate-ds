marillion entered the mold of prog rock bands bland. since the departure of the poet (fish), marillion has lost its soul. the texts, music everything is different now since easter ... "(season's end). it is a prog rock band as there are plenty of others while the marillion of "fugazi", "script" and other "grendel, heart of lothian, etc ..." has managed to become one of the greatest. this does not make me nostalgic (though?) but the coat has faded with time. a page has turned and my divorce was done in 1989. the star that shines today is dull.
