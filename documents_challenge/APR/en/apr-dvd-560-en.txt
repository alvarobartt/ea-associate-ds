after the vision of such films as "excalibur" (boorman's brilliant.) and the rigor of "robin hood: prince of thieves", it is right to laugh (or cry.) before this what turnip lancelot. the film is full of weaknesses: poor richard gere is unfortunately wrapped up in his image playboy who hardly appropriate to a knight of the roundtable. as for his game very hollow platitudes of a rarely equaled, it does not address a scenario too predictable sets which are conspicuous by their research (a forest, everything is more simple ... a castle more like a house of cards than anything else.), costumes of a disconcerting simplicity of the blue "gentiles", much worse for "evil" for reflection of the manichaean .. ah ah ah, this movie erase from our memories anyway you forget quickly.
