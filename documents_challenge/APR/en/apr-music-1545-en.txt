this album came out eight years ago, remains the absolute masterpiece of genre.suede then his apog√©e.ils are the masters of the britpop of the time. the limpid melodies are delicately carved by master craftsman: bernard butler . the voice of bewitching brett anderson is all with a grace and lightness rarely achieved. butler quit the band during the summer of 1994, weeks before its release for its project solo.suede never recovered completely ... this project is undoubtedly one of the ten best albums of the 90s.
