the italian progressive rock gave us some beads, and more particularly pfm. after a first album entirely successful (storia di un minuto), the group reissued the feat and is definitely the concert of the great prog. album warm, often singing in italian murmured softly, the compositions are linked together without time low. the sound is varied (mellotron, harp, violin, guitar ,...) and the influences of classical music's great. and while all may seem a bit gentillet, breaking rhythms, melodies (a little like a gentle giant) attract the attention throughout the listening. an album (a little short on duration) which is a good introduction into the italian prog before exploring this further horizon. (banco, le orme ,...)
