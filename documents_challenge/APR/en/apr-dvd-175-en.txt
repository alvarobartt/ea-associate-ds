no surprise and no finesse. the exhibition is good, as always in this kind of movie, but the last third is simply boring. and i do not really see the added value compared to the film by ang lee. edward norton is excellent as always, tim roth, too, while liv tyler is a true flower pot. the scenario is as thick as a sheet of cigarette paper and the hulk in synthesis is still not convincing. finally, a very average film, without interest. it is far from a night dark or spider man.
