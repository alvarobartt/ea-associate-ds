totally agree that it is wrong to impose the subtitles. for my part, i no longer buy the bluray tf1 and studio canal and i advise all bilingual to do so. in germany, for example, the subtitles are not taxed and u.s. editions are often the choice of the inlay or not. so why enrich publishers who do not respect the freedom that can provide a dvd or bluray? ... in any case, those who agree should also push for an end to this practice, considering the price of bluray in general ...
