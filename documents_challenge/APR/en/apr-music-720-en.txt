forever slave was very hard for this first album, the group proposes a gothic metal and symphonic majesty that plunges the listener into a world dark and captivating their music is very descriptive, their universe worked with a very interresting concept. each piece is essential and this disc really has a soul. they blame a lack of originals, but i found instead that they differ from other symphonic metal bands with their dark side, the violin also brings a personal touch, and lady angellyca voice blends perfectly with the hollow voice of the drummer. it's been a year and a half listening to the album repeatedly and i'm tired. forever slave is my favorite band and i look forward to the next album that should not delay. to possess absolutely!
