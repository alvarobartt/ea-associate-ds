this album is not worth a good gross women (diamonds) or jackpot (chingy). if not love french rap that rap is a bit old so he better not buy. at least with american rap songs when the lyrics are null you hear them but there you have to. so i would say one thing, it's rather average. once we listen to the first two songs, it gives no desire to continue.
