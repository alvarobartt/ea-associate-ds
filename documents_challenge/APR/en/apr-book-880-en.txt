i recommend this book to anyone who has discovered the indian literature. but the novel is more than that and is far from exotic cliches that might be expected. he can discover a great author. the book speaks of a region (the area of wetlands at the mouth of the ganges in the region calculta) and characters that all a priori contrasts (a sinner, a infermiere, a specialist dolphins, an indian city, ..). these characters are linked not only by ties of sentiment but by fondammentaux links: report to the history of a region, compared to the memory, modernity, fondammentaux more choices in life. the novel manages to bring out more universal concerns about life choices (compared modernity / archisme, urban / nature, scientific / myths, ...). the nature is one of the major themes of the book. it is present by the myths that vehicle (the legends with these very role of the bengal tiger as a catalyst of the devil, the forces of good and evil) and the forces it unleashed at the end of the novel ( the arrival of the tsunami). forces that will compel people to make choices crucial to their future. nicolas
