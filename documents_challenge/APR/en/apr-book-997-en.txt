a book that does not denounce, does not instill a unstoppable way to avoid confusing the bladders and lanterns, to get rid of our illusions and open their eyes to what is the reality of capitalism, but which seem to suggest in the right line of gilles deleuze. you will not find here a new anti-capitalist but a factory to concepts - alternatives infernal little hands, reorganizer flows moving, thought captured - that challenge the market thinking machine. a concern also does not silence the voices of minority and build a whole other world, because it is possible to re-politicize issues confiscated.
