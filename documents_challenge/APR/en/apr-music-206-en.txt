the multichannel recording is very similar to a stereo recording which would be added ue slight (very slight) reflection on the rear channels. as for interpretation, after all the more important to a cd, that this requiem is strangely molassone, lack dynamics (if it's also the mix, at least in part), and is in my bad taste: lacrimosa is almost stronger than the dies irae ... no depth. i was very disappointed. for my part, i well remember this record as a record to avoid. with that, i listen back version of good old karajan ... (all tastes are in nature)
