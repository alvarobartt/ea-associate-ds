and not the last, because damage would judge the new cake manson on one listen. but what a disappointment, everything was that manson manson was gone. exit the energy or the violence of some music and especially the rated unhealthy environments. this album is neither more nor less than an album rock without relief, we are far from extraordinary albums that made the reverend a star, may be that the departure of twiggy ramirez has been important in this non-event. i hope the next plays, i will reconsider my decision, but frankly, the flatness of all let me no illusions.
