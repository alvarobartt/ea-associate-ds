i chained the film just after the very surprising (and very good) eden log.je think we should in fact encourage the french cinema to engage in science fiction.mais eden log as much i liked dante 01 i déçu.il is both pretentious and bavard.sauf may be for lambert wilson who picks a word and the film remains constantly in the scenar gaz.le is heavy with biblical metaphors and visual effects exemptions and lack of rhythm does not plead for all. many have pointed out a successful atmosphere; honestly i rather feel that caro was not too thick and gave us a mixture of alien 3 and 4 . i have no brief joined the world of bald heads, but i remain willing to découvirir other films of science fiction made in france.
