alas, this is what i think might characterize the latter part of season 4. too much length, too much talk and too come from drinking despite the good times of the last episode, darken the end of this adventure. the script runs out of steam, the action dies, the inspiration dries up. everything is lost in a sea of alcohol, and an unnecessarily complicated plot. fortunately it is the first season.
