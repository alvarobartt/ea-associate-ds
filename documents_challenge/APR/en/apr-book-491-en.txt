then me, i like teulé. but there ... how to say ... flee.'s a little story which is very long to read, painful wait. from the first page we know how it will turn. at first it's funny, after it becomes repetitive and useless, why do lisp alan? to make it cute? frankly ... there is no story no plot (you tell me, that's close to 200 years it's like that, and you're right, but there is not even style!). i hope jean teulé was amused, and he will soon return to the writings more interesting (i invite you to read all his other novels). one has the impression that he has not forgotten his passion for poetry (he quotes baudelaire implicitly, for example, throughout the novel). without rancor?
