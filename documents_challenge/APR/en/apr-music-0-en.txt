when muse released her, the shock was great: pop, rock, opera, an english trio found the strength of radiohead with the lyricism of jeff buckley. in the following albums, they finally realize that muse was more queen and her will to excess, sometimes successfully (still a very nice album, albeit below showbiz) and sometimes to our great misfortune (is old right out and fatigue). in total, two bad and two good album, one excellent. resistance this is the album that could tip the balance one way or the other ... and it is quickly seen: muse has finally plunged the bombastic side. what was more fun on here absolution is drunk enough, especially as this time bellamy and his band does not just closer to queen, they outright ape group of freddy mercury, except that it is less well and it ends up being irrelevant. between uprising (and his guitar which sounds like blondie's call me period) and final exogenesis (symphony rock fairly flat), muse is trying to lay songs based on what the group is already since years, but by adding 3 tons. result, the feeling of seeing a recipe and applied it to see a big production songs wrapped to hide their misery, all this does not really want to listen to the album on loop. there are many interesting melodies, but all is so rough, in the end we prefer showbiz listen.
