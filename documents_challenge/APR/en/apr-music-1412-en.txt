an album at group level: pathetic and boring. guns and roses, the group most ridiculed in the world. a singer megalomaniac small shorts tight, wrapped in an american flag. that is why this album: songs, flat voice chat crushed metal music for the masses, for teens in the late 1980s. one or two songs are tolerable on this album, at least acknowledge that, but this is only important to give this album puppets whose attitude is macho rockstar and vomiting. avoid this disc.
