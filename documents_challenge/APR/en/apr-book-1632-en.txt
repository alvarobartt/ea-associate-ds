i have never read a book of "chick lit" as unattractive. fortunately, he has few pages. the humor falls flat (when there). characters are so many people mistake. can not even focus on heroin ... it'sa shame because the idea of an exchange of mail could be interesting. it failed: the atmosphere is cut and gives the impression of a series without beginning or end of cliches without interest ... i very much regret having already bought the second installment in the author ... i do not know if i'll read it say ...
