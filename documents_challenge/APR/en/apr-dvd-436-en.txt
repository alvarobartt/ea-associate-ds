yet i am a big fan of science fiction, but "sunshine" left me on my fain! moreover, the selected music will not save the movie in value, it looks to find anywhere but in space! and that of the end credits is really the coup de grace! generally, this music make you stay in communion with what you just saw, and i love this moment! but then you jump on the remote! sorry!
