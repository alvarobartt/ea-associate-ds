acknowledging the significant work of dante, i was pleased to read this thriller based on the frame of translation in the united states of divine comedy, in the second half of the nineteenth century. unfortunately, many lengths and are bored by endless quickly after the unnecessary details and descriptions in the course of history. a consultant only if you have exhausted the entire category of historical thrillers!
