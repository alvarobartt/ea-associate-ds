the first time i saw this film was the cinema. i hated it. i found it boring, and ridiculous situations. but that was long ago (when i was a young teen). a year ago, this film came with several others in a special promotion. so i bought and reviewed. in all, this is by far my favorite! and yes! this time i found the solution for parents to overcome their son to be amusing. i laughed, i literally folded. i could watch a hundred times that i do not tire. plus it goes, the more i appreciate it. so i think it's a film to see from a certain age. when we can finally apreciate situations caucasus and the cynicism that follows. of course, we laugh at the misfortune of others, namely tanguy. but how it will, it is so funny!
