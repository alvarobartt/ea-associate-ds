ok, it's sad that he died, he was nice, little greg. but he had no talent, just a voice, given his lung disease, was really impressive i purity (but if it had not been ill, we would not have noticed, it would not even starac won this', however, given the vote - who were mostly sympathetic - and who once flocked to the announcement of his illness revealed). album more than mediocre in my opinion. simply purchase after his death in the belief that it was good while he was alive, he was slaughtered, i am the most hypocritical and sickening disrespect. more daring not to love him, apparently caught by the utter audacity. i dare say, even if reggrettable her death, i still say that i hate this kind of ready-made products, tasteless, untalented. and compare the voice lemarchal those of jeff buckley and freddie mercury, as i saw on another site, is abberrant. i am not proposing a boycott, but just questioning: have you bought the disc, passed on 1 may 2007, only because he is dead? how many of you possessed prior to his death, did not like it, and suddenly, a revelation, like it now? how many of you know that the tour 'outstanding' by nikos, gregory had been canceled for lack of success of the album, singles and concerts already given? stop the hypocrisy.
