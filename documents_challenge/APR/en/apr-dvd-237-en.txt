indiana fan, i rushed to buy the box without paying too much attention to the technical spec of the edition. i launched the first component on my system ... and dd5.1 surprise, stereo sound, i check the menu and the second surprise no french track in 5.1, only 2.0 and 5.1 in english! accustomed to the voice of harrison ford in french, change has been pretty brutal, even confusing -&gt; too bad that's the price we have not been able to have a sound worthy of the series, and need to be content least.
