without rancor, spike lee offers his art and his city a great ode to life and second chance through edward "mouth" norton, the incarnation of an america that has forever lost its innocence. despite outbursts of patriotism somewhat displaced (given the universality of the way, we would have appreciated a certain distance - modesty? - vis-Ã -vis cultural references ... something even closer to the heart in all cases) limit its scope, this is a work of an author not episodic but which includes, following the example of his hero, you terrace you over and you grew up ... neither more nor less.
