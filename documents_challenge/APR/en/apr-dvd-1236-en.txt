after the success of the film incomprehensible dany boon and now this series, i do understand that whenever a fiction will frame or as a subject area (city) picturesque, the french are rueront it like a bee on honey ? the worst thing is that this series without issues and its panel of caricatured characters (the same communication, the server gay, the unscrupulous businessman ....) attracts not only the housewife of 50 years but apparently all slices of the population (including children). and worse still, some probably buy the dvd (already, buy a dvd, you really love, then a series, you can imagine ...)! i thought we had hit bottom, but obviously much digging yet ....
