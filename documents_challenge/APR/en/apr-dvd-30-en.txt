both the book is fascinating, as this film is close to the turnip. the actors are bad (special mention for the lead actress), the special effects are missed (qd the vampire short in the forest, it's almost laughable) and french dubbing do what they can to save the sinking dialogues ... have you the first volume of the series into a book, forget the film.
