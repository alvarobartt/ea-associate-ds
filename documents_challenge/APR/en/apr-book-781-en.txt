one way "alive" to learn the recent history of the armenian people. the reader is not overwhelmed by impersonal figures as in the history books, but he finds emotions, happiness, and finally the drama of an armenian family before and during the massacres committed by the turks during the genocide 1915. i love the little details of daily life as they eat, their festivals, etc.. mixing fictional characters with personalities that have ever existed is also a very interesting approach. this book made me want to know more about it. so i ordered "a shameful act" and other books on the life of soghomon tehlirian.
