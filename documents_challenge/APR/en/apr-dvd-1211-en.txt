say that, if you have to play doom 3, do not watch the film, it is altogether missed the creature are not diversified enough, it was not even the big demons of the game and the boss above, they did even not complied with the scenario in the film, take the devil, a zombie, and of course virus resident evil, and you've doom. if the film will have been filmed in first person, or we see only the weapon, it will have been more fun. if you 've missed so much the better for those who have looked, sorry.
