the first plays of the new album from edguy will not erase fears. just like the previous album and the last avantasia (side project of singer tobias sammet) tinnitus sanctus guides the group toward a deadlock. less lyrical, less melodic, more basic, the music of german is certainly less inspired than before. the album is not bad in itself, it even contains some good tracks ( ` 'ministry of saints''by way of introduction, or`' speedhoven''which revives the magic) but the sauce does not really , failing to quite title means bland, soulless. tobias sammet sings much lower, the tempo has slowed considerably, edguy has become a good group of hard rock. too bad the group is moving in that direction, which does not prevent me to go see them in concert ... there is something else ...
