yes, put two stars to an album of the great period of neurosis will make your hair stand on top of many fans, more enlightened than you think. i discovered this album by neurosis and often said that afterwards, the first is always the favorite. this is hardly the case. it's long, very repetitive magma to move to a group pressed (another kind), singing (weak group) is not to his advantage and production the least suitable of the "big 4" of training (of souls at zerro to times of grace). some very good parts, some fairly monstrous tracks (the sequence of the last two) a depressing atmosphere as always (in my of view, perhaps the most frightening of their albums, just before enemy of the sun). say you feel that the group is not bad, he wants to say something, but that 'he loses a little off. fortunately, learning the lessons of too long and poor production, neurosis will knock at the door albini record his masterpiece, an album major 90s to do doubt, the huge time of grace, a sort of summit of post hardcore and only album of its kind which i might consider putting 5 stars (yes, as a kind of blue perfectly!).
