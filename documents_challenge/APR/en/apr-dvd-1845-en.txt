i found this disappointing tv movie. lorant deutsch lack of credibility in the role of sartre! many scenes of sunsets that would suggest that these two great authors of the twentieth century were a rabbit and a hot lesbian! barely addresses do we occupation and commitments that we already see the release ... in those interested in these authors, we can only recommend to read. telefilm this is to avoid .
