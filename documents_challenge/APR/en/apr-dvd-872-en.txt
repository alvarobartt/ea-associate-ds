and the arrival of gad elmaleh in place of vincent elbaz does not shock at all is to tell you!, then the character played by patrick always melki is pushed to the extreme ... the introduction of the character played by prevost is there perhaps to replace boringher but it is largely up to scratch and we love to hate him as his "servant" who camped by pef is still plusq but how vile what eddy patrick serge and the 'nikemouker'!!!! is great ... it's rare that a sequence is as though the first part (i think walt di $ ney) and then the 2 is higher than 1 &amp; i always look with much pleasure! relax you and put you on film is less a caricature and is a perfect continuation to see or have in his perfect dvd library [you will not regret one minutes] great movie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nelly
