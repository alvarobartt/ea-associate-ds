well yes, i have not finished this book! but i do not like not finishing a book i started but then i've failed. nothing caught me in the book: neither the style nor the story, especially not the central character that i can not call a hero. everything is repugnant to him, and even trying the 2nd or 3rd degree, no, i did not come. so if you're like me, you decomplex, and close the book!
