while the plot is slow to establish, it certainly does not run in any direction (it is not 24), but if you want realism, a beautifully narrated story from first to last episode, "on turn "is for you. for me the only series that has, at this point, explored and exploited their characters are oz, six feet under and dexter. a difference is that in "the wire" the likelihood is much more present, even if the finding of a losing battle against the drug gangs is quite scary. in short, a series of best if not the best series ever produced by one country (whatever one may think otherwise) who can make the playoffs.
