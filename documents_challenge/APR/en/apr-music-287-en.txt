at first listen one is immediately excited by this new opus. prince is once again up to its reputation. a readjustment of the mixes was carried out by the prince so that these titles sound decidedly more current than the preceding albums. it was jazz, de la soul, pop, gni to beat heavy sound latin, is just sorry that n 'is not electronica, as was the epoch of 1999, or sign' o the time, etc. ... remains a compelling and enjoyable album.
