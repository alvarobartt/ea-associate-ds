it's absolutely incredible to see the press criticism (thank you god i do not read newspapers more than long), and critics amazoniaques to 4 stars. i only have one question for mr. almodovar, all newspapers intellectuals, and others, and all the spectators in the second state of this emerging genre of "immoral tale": "if it was your mother, your sister, your daughter, your girlfriend, you had entrusted to doctors and a hospital, how to call you here ?"... : a rape is not it! oh yes me too. shameful and degrading, as by what it is pedro a. who tells, on a canvas, or those newspapers always on the lookout for a news item in a filthy hospital, history has at least one common point for all she can cry. not even scabrous, sleazy.
