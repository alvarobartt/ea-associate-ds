we were promised an album lighter (light?) but with real sound placebo inside. so? strength side, note that the arrival of steve forrest, the new drummer is done discreetly. i did not notice any difference blatant sound. the songs of this album: nevermind kitty litter, a first piece ... very nice, even a little cutesy. one feels, however, here all the collective efforts of reconstituted for "ring" placebo. some good riffs, percussion effective, but good. kitty litter, whatever. it connects on ashtray heart, and its chorus (!), go, hop, turn to 3. this battle for the sun, which wants hymnesque, but fails. it heard a thousand times, and it is only the great singer of placebo few albums ago. the rise of promising, but no surprise. i personally bet on the next single "what it's worth." it takes the hit coming festivals, the hymn that all new converts sing by making winks. then it concatenates pieces more or less quiet, with some electro sounds (devil in the details; speak in tongues ; happy you're gone; kings of medicine) and more rhythmic pieces (looks like the devil's here to stay; breathe underwater), deliberately pop (bright lights) or more rock (the never-ending why). all that is left listen kindly, but you are never arrested by a particular song. this album marks the return of a group, and proves its ability to deliver an album of great consistency, and in particular his own, but misses the test of novelty, unable to climb to a higher level. a transition album, promising, but not a masterpiece. vivement neighbor. maybe.
