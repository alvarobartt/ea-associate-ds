to me, this album is undoubtedly the best of jean jacques milteau, especially when one considers the evolution of his style and such compositions. it is true that this artist has evolved towards compositions more "easy" listening, but with sincerity and talent.il never had so much feeling on this album and the artists present all excellent. jean jacques thank you!
