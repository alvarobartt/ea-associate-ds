i must say i am very excited to find this peter pan on dvd. i went to see the film, and the emotion was at the rendezvous. the magic of childhood, a return to fairy tales, imagination along the eyes .... everything is there for us to dream ... and we push a little more willing to stop growing. a magnificent film, full of emotion to keep to ourselves .... to grow while keeping her child's soul ... i am 37 years old, and i shall still dreaming that all this may be true .... a moment of pure wonder and magic to possess absolutely
