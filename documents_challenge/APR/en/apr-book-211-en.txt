i read "trafficked" the first 3 volumes of detectives patrick kenzie and angie gennaro, with special reference to "rite", a true jewel of chandler. while facing criticism dythirambiques on "gone baby gone," i had not hesitated to throw myself on the heels of this 4th volume and what a disappointment! it was not until the unfolding of history is badly screwed (though this is the case: the first 250 pages the author or walk on the wrong track in which he and the reader does not feel concerned) but especially when the story is supposed to begin in earnest ... how heavy! treating a theme such as child abuse (sexual abuse of children and others) requires a viewpoint that is not just good thinking. here are monstrous monstrous pedophiles even their physical appearance (and the scenes of the book was about the limit of endurance), the "bad guys" are actually "nice" means that use of "inappropriate" ... and the reader closes the book with his conscience.
