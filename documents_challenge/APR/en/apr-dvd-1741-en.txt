i'm having too. it must be admitted that it inflated: invite a friend to the house with his camera, tell your life by turning over two or three old folk magazines and showing the blurry photos that you have taken - or reclaimed - at the exit of concert dylan on stage, and that's it. you add a few lengths, landscapes in the town where dylan lived, the road goes, we believe in the 13h tf1. voila all that, you make a dvd, you paste over the music a little country / folk with a bontempi organ - not the dylan of course and you try to sell it. ola, the amazon, zero star, you have not?
