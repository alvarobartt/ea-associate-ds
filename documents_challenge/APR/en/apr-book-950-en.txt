yes disappointing, some issues are of very questionable (quantième roaring?) so who has heard of rays b and t? also when there is no certainty in response to a question asking why the (brain , etc.)? finally there or the author misleads the reader is on the formula e = mc2, where it is said that einstein was imprunté poincare! indeed, even if poincare following the work of lorentz would have arrived at this formula (?)-sure lorentz got there) was in the context of the electromagnetic mass of the electron. the genius of einstein was (and is what history judges) to deduce this formula simply postulates of relativity and that in all generality for mass energy equivalence (and not for particular cases already known and / or assumed before 1905). + in the paper of poincare is 1905 and not 1900 as it is written in the text.
