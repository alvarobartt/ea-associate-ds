despite the presence of talent before and behind the camera (jon avnet and al pacino), 88 minutes sorely disappointed. based on the concept of the series "24" (action in real time), the story just started and do fails to really convince. certainly, al pacino is flawless in his role as a psychiatrist, but never follows completion and fails to inject any semblance of suspense and originality. soulless film, 88 minutes thus ends on a unfinished aftertaste.
