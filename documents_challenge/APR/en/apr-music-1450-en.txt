funky wish, mega-melodic, funny, incisive, headbanger, smiling, happy, bombastic, the latest installment of saga finally looks like its many predecessors. the difference in sound absolutely amazing here, and know-how that borders on disgust. this group has an identity completely inimitable, he knows and enjoys every one of 11 tracks is pure saga, especially the first two which are in themselves a condensed 20-year career! loaded with catchy parts, refrains heady and exciting effects, hoc is one of the best opus of a single group to which it is difficult to resist.
