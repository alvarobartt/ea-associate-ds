a monument of sci-fi. while the story is complicated and complex at first, but david lynch (director style so special) has an atmosphere that makes you want to see the film again and look more closely at the work of frank herbert. toto's music also helps us move in this universe. if you like science fiction in its purest form, you'll love this movie. (sting fans will have a surprise ...)
