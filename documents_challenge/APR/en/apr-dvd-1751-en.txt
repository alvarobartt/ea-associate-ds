i personally loved this movie. it is modeled on the comic mas remains fairly faithful, while allowing someone who has not read of it again. the psychology of the characters has been preferred over the script, and fans of james bond films or other actions may not like for that. but it is a film very interesting and seems more than vraisembleble comics. fortunately, the costumes are different! anyway, i preferred the comic, and as wolverine was my favorite character's, i was not disappointed! i have seen at least 20 times and i'm never tired.
