besides the lack of bonuses, and french subtitles, it is noteworthy that the dubbed version in french is not true to the original dialogues. this can be seen simply by looking at the vf with english subtitles (very faithful to the original version). the substance of some replicas is changed entirely in french, among others at the end of "a grand day out" ( "hold tight lad, and think of lancashire hotpot!" and "set coordinates ..." are replaced by considerations cheese unrelated) and just before the continuation of "the wrong trousers" (in english wallace continues to bemoan the fate of the cabinet, instead of whining that he sees nothing). doubling of "a close shave" has by no cons big flaw. in short, all that deserves a re-dubbing coherent three episodes.
