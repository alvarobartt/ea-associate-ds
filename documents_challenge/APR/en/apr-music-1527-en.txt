or is there .... it hurts! i loved the album hybrid theory ... but i hate already reanimation .... from warm, that's all we did. and in addition, this warming borders on the ridiculous. the pieces are unlike anything ever to the originals (see the new version of my december. the original is wonderful, the news is null ...). in short, an album very disappointing ... for those who do not yet know lp, i recommend instead listening to hybrid theory, reanimation, as is every bit disappointing ...
