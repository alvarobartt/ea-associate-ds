i do not buy books 'people', even for the holidays, even for laughs. but to reduce this work to an effusion of feature would be a terrible mistake. if charlotte valandrey is known for his tv and film appearances, it is the only one common point with the distressing stories of starlets. his life is rooted in reality, those who do not invent those that usually are not known. i had no idea of his hiv status, let alone his heart transplant. to me, charlotte valandrey was a nice memory of 20 years ago, the space of a film, "red kiss". i had not seen his appearances in the series "cordier, j. and flic". but by getting in the press release of this book and its raison d'etre, i decided to buy it. i come away really upset. this book is not sad, it does not spoil your weekend. instead, charlotte valandrey is alive and never complains. his story, terrible as it is not never veers into pathos and is often able to smile, will not only by the description of cynicism and hypocrisy of her life, the betrayals so shabby that they seem impossible. and this rage to live and forget. the text is really well written and reads with pleasure, without morbid curiosity. it will bring a lot to those who need a helping hand, to support a test, but will be quite a 'boost' to all those who simply have wanted to see how we can get out of most black deep, with lightness and insousciance without forgetting anything.
