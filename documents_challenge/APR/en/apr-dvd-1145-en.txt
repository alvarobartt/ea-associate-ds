monk is to the 2000s what columbo was the 70s. a detective at least unusual and intuition stunning, clever scenarios, excellent soundtrack and humor. add to this a perfect casting and get an unknown number in france since played poorly but has made big scores in the usa. note alas producers have preferred to stop this series every success, there will be only 8 seasons. to discover urgently and if you want an autograph, you just write, the actors consistently respond within two months. hats off for not having a big head lol.
