the cohort of fans waiting for the reissue of the first star wars trilogy in its original version without digital effects added, "unaltered" ... hmm, big disappointment. first the quality of the image as "good" that the k7 vhs (palot√°s color, contrast medium) and only in 4 / 3! same for the sound, nothing is clean and it sounds dry and depth. as we see the quality of picture and sound digitally enhanced versions, it is reasonable to say that framing 16 / 9 compatible 4 / 3, a 5.1 (or at least remastered), and that an improve colors certainly would not cost much to lucasfilm studios. but no, it was probably asking too much. fans are therefore entitled to the rough around the edges. it will teach us too much to ask his lordship that george lucas was probably better to do.
