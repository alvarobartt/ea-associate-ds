the beginning is effective, it clings away the film, especially with the beautiful string of characters. we expected something really surprising, the suspense is there, there are lots of ways in which the film can go ... and finally after an hour, it leads to absolutely nothing ... no story no explanation, all packaged in a "nonsense" from 1:15 minutes ... and that they have all been paid millions to appear fifteen minutes, we frankly wondered if the actors are sometimes motivated by something else that money, but my respect for whitaker, quaid and weaver is great. hopefully they have been fooled like us, thinking that it was a bomb ... but for me, frankly, i think that the authors have mocked us. especially today, with series full of stories winding and unexpected endings, i do understand that we can miss as much imagination.
