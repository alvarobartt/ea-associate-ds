the 1st album left me on my hunger, that one is a masterpiece of indie-pop, rock, prog-rock overtones with a little cheap. king thought that will pass unnoticed even then honestly, this disc should be enthroned in any self-respecting nightclub in 2008. rather easily accessible and addictive as can be, he must listen to at mount zoomer. and rather than ten times.
