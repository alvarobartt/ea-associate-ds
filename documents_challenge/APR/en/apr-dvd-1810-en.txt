kirk douglas is decidedly an actor's career unique. "detective story" shows again. certainly, the story of the cop obsessed with his job is not always very original. and portraits of cops just lit abound in the fifties, especially the extravagant "the big combo" by joseph h. lewis it would be good to repeat in a clean copy. by arpport with cornel wilde, kirk douglas gives a greater density at the obession quiles works. the print is excellent, the black and white very clean. for fans of film noir, the level of the "crossroads of death".
