if this book was a "document", the author should have the support of his facts with references slightly less succinct than those listed in the bibliography. neither paper nor novel, this book seems to be rather a montage of fictionalized various rumors relating to events disorders of the recent history of the united states. the process does not seem very honest. as for writing, the least we can say is that it is not high quality.
