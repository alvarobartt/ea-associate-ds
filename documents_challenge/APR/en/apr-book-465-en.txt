this book is both an essay on the art of writing and an autobiography of the author. the intention is very serious (it does not trifle with grammar, style, it does not matter how a manuscript to a publisher ...) but presented with great humor which makes reading is never boring. apprentices writers will find this book a wealth of practical advice on the act of writing, tools, and how to navigate the middle of the editon. fans of stephen king will also find the story of a part of his life: how it came to writing her first galleys, emotions and impressions, the story of his acidente and its consequences. what i liked most in this book is the humility of the author (after all, he sells his books to the shovel and take a big head in her place) and the fact that he calls a spade a spade (including vocabulary rather rude). his frankness, his honesty, his straight talk (or rather his outspoken writing) are emphasized. and his humor appealed to me. i am not a fan of stephen king but i think i'm going to.
