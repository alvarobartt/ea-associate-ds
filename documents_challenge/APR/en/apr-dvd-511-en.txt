i discovered this series on dailymotion (i know, not good) in vo sub standard. i had to hang qq episodes, i could not find the scenar super interesting at the beginning (the hunt for supernatural creatures, already seen ...). but gradually i became totally a fan! for each story is fantastic especially the pretext to develop shading really well treated around the complex relationship between 2 brothers are very far apart at first, and their mysterious father who will take its place in season 2. me i found the 2nd season even more brilliant. but a key board: make an effort, do not watch the series in french version!! i noticed on m6: the voices are nazes can not be worse, it removes all the flavor in dialogues and all the piquancy of the particular personality of dean, which is awesome with his big voice macho en vo!
