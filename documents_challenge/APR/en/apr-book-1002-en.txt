well, frankly, the first 3 volumes of the new cycle of stars were not all bad. the 4th was not great, but i told myself, things will get better. the 5th was less catastrophic. but the 6th if not a real failure, no longer able to raise the level. the design is so good, the humor less fine. lanfeust goes from hero status to that idiot over, it's a short little damage. we have a feeling sloppy when he took a year out for this volume ... if you learn more about the backdrop of history scenario is a little weak, damage ...
