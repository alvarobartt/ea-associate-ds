is fun, nothing more. the author describes in detail (in his opinion) what not to do but gives no advice, which is part of his proof of modesty since he has never been published! (he admits at the beginning of the book) can be concluded that it did not follow the advice he gives to others ... the title, therefore, is a bit much. the aspiring writer who relies on this book to help should look elsewhere. without interest.
