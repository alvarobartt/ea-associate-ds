this re-mastering is pure happiness. george harrison has refined the production of grandiose phil spector in 1970. spector has an undeserved reputation. his "wall of sound" is indigestible; whatsoever on the work of harrison, lennon or to a lesser extent on the let it be beatles, one has the impression that its products were stored in the toilets. the extraordinary quality of this masterpiece was marred by this production fails. well, yet the songs were so good that i loved this lp despite the sound came from wcpublic. george has addressed this weakness by explaining politely that he thought was appropriate at that time now seems a bit overdone ... . some good surprises in the bonus with "i live for you" a song that i do not know which is remarkable freshness with a beautiful melody and a guitar and surprisingly original. the instrumental "what is life" is also a very pleasant surprise. as a bonus we also find very simple versions of "beware of darkness" and "let it down" and the 2000 version of "my sweet lord." the second cd is a treat as well. some pieces exemptions and this work would have came out in 1970 a double album of cosmic inspiration. only small b√©nol to fireworks, the cover has been colored. version of black / white was superior. for cons, the same image is found inside the cd with an addition of "buldings" and smokestacks. and to complement the whole, a booklet of twenty pages of unpublished photos and commentary of the great "george". 126 minutes of happiness. did not take any ride. would deserve 7 stars. garbo talks george harrison is free ....
