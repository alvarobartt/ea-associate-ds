i would first like to remind some that "from a book" does not mean exact reproduction, where the lack of detail that can be in the livre.et for those who do not loved this movie is mainly for the ummah pro-gothic as i never tire of watching again and again, and when they do not look at the soundtrack listen! so if you do not like it your right, but do not dirty the film is already worship me, and for much else, thank you to respect those who think differently!
