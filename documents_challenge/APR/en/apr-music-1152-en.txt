although this album is very different from the first three, the turn taken by the group for it is pleasant. touch me is very explicit and shows us a side of mojo risin 'of the time but shaman's blues &amp; wild child reminds us of the attraction for morrison always denigrated indian culture in the u.s. in 1970 ... and then there is the sinful wisful the rhythms of blues and runnin 'blue tempting though somewhat shifted to the origin of the rock group ... when the title song the soft parade, there reigns inside still a little dark spirit well calculated to morrison but also much of the poetry of jim ... still short an album to own and listen again and again
