what is the land of yiddish humor? this film recreates the atmosphere and humor unheard of shtetl! it allows us to laugh and cry a little better understanding of the holocaust ... it's like a scottish shower we laugh and we cry. rufus muller and are great in jewish religious and communist. much better than the pale copy of benin, which ultimately did not understand and would not show us the jewish humor! a must see!
