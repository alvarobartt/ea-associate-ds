i read your comments before buying it, and frankly, it made me want to read it. but then, what a disappointment! from the beginning, the style is not really great, and the story completely predictable. i'm hooked, but nothing! go, a small drop of emotion, but a really small! result: disappointed. i do not recommend it.
