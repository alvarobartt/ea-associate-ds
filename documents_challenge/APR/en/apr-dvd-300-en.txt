jane austen said of emma than anyone (besides herself) would not. if other austen heroines can be wrong (elizabeth bennett is a good example), emma is a professional error of assessment. his blunders are so predictable that it's sometimes laughable. while emma is intelligent but she is lost in his schemes and eventually interpret reality through what she wants it to be. it is wrong therefore with great confidence and aplomb. we do not want him too, she does not want to hurt anyone after all, but were more likely to make fun of emma that identify with it.
