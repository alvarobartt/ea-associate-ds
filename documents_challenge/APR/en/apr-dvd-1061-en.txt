i already found the new stephen king's very average compared to his usual production (read the book "everything's eventual"), but the typical hollywood film, i was greatly disappointed. only clich√© with good recipes u.s. who were excellent in the years 70-80 and even 90 but in 2008 said as another user is zero. i think this film is to be avoided. if you love horror movies, you tend to turn "evil dead ', "black fortress" and "the exorcist", "the hills have eyes no. 1" or romero, fulci, argento, etc. ...
