as and when thoughts of the heroine we like to wander with her very quickly when we rattrappe intrigue in all its horror! a rapid pace of colorful characters, suspects galore for an outcome without mercy! i found brigitte aubert with that title, i must admit that even before closing the book i am eager to order the last book (death wood) and other securities. fan of h. clark, cornwell p and p mcdonald, brigitte aubert pleasantly surprised me.
