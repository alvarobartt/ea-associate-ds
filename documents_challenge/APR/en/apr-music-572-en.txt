here is a great interpretation led by bernstein, selection and sequencing of the songs are smart, you can not see the pictures move. the disc ends with 11 min of the night on bald mountain. this disc could serve as a soundtrack to an old horror film thanks to the striking effects of orchestration by maurice ravel. however, the recording is old and does not satisfy audiophiles. other more recent recordings have a more realistic dynamic example on percussion gnomus.
