i blame this movie is not so omissions and infidelities (though they are really annoying sometimes), but also how the film was mounted. everything is disjointed. it jumps from cock to the ass, there is no chain between scenes. it actually looks like a patchwork quilt made from the book. the actors, especially harry, are less convincing than in previous films, the less magic, especially since they are dressed "undercover" most of the time. however, some good points: excellent remus lupine, some good passes with the new dumbledore, and gorgeous images. congratulations also to buckbeak and werewolf, well done. but i really can not put more than 2 stars.
