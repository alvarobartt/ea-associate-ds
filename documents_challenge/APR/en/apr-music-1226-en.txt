whether you're a fan of celtic music and punk rock fan, you should definitely buy this cd. an original group and full of energy that should be known in france, the dropkick murphys you give this album with the opportunity to unwind by listening to the music thoroughly. the words may as well be interesting, dealing with topical themes (world full of hate, the outcast) and weak but fun (kiss me, i'm shitfaced). a must.
