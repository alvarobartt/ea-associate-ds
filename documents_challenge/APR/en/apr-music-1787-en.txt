in 1983, pete way, ufo bassist, broke away with phil mogg and founded this great combo, taking with him two of his cronies, including paul raymond, and cozy up to a then unknown singer, end more, whose voice mocks reeks of alcohol. what more natural than the group name also refers to the alcohol! after a first opus prometeur entitled "vices," which contained some sublime pieces, this second lp is a true masterpiece, and more's voice is a marvel, aided by its huge and rapidly pete way form, question song-writing ... listening for example, "heaven tonight", which will also be resumed on another of their albums, and with a different singer, but that is unfortunately less talent. for illuster my remarks, steve harris, bassist of iron maiden, ufo and fan to the eternal, had a cult for this group to the point of wearing t-shirts with their color on stage ... if after this, you're not convinced ... a waysted, boy, please.
