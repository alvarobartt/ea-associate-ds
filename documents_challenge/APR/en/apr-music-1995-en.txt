the new cd by neil young "are you passionate?" is, as usual, sublime both in substance and form. the words of the 11 cd tracks are haunted by the loss of a loved one ( "you're my girl," "mr. disappointment" or "quit"). neil young in the song "let's roll" makes a heartfelt tribute to the victims of september 11. otherwise, neil young has beautifully surrounded by other excellent between booker t. jones (organ), duck dunn (bass), but also faithful frank "poncho" sampedro (of crazy horse that young found elsewhere for the thundering "goin 'home") as well as pegy and astrid young (respectively, wife and sister young). certainly neil young never disappoints. strongly his next cd!
