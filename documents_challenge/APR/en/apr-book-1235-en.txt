i loved this book. its structure is very linear, poetic text, the beauty of this sad story. still, i'm fairly quickly asked and i just started reading the text differently. the end was not a real surprise. after the scene at the restaurant, i had an idea last head. i must say that for once, this does not happen all the time, i've read the text in depth, and i even read twice most paragraphs, because it has rarely happened to find much beauty in such simplicity. my rating 4 / 5 however, the gray souls are invincible ...
