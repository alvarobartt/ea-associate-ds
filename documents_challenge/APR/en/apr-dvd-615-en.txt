a condition to be really good audience, we can smile sometimes following this very artificial rehash of previous episodes. there is more here or earthy, or fantasy, and the charm of improvisation gave way to professionalism applied marred by cliches, vulgarities, of ridiculous improbabilities. in short, it feels warm and heavy as it was the worst of funes. to see if you are very, very tired.
