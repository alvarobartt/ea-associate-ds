personally, i felt obliged to have a copy of this film, being an inveterate fan of madonna. result: a totally tasteless film, a cumbersome unthinkable. i wonder how a host of actors alike were willing to turn a turnip parei (madonna, quentin tarantino, a banderas ...). avoid emergency. the nullity of the film also feels ds dialogues of unimaginable poverty.
