i am in the shock of the reading of this book is truly amazing poignant Ã©mouvant tie-when one starts (it takes a few pages to go in the book) we never left. the quest for the american jew in search of past that we follow step by step and we gradually reveals what happens to the family of the brother of her grandfather remained in poland during the 2nd war fascinante.est this is the attitude of his grandfather and the void left by the unknown that drives the author in this race against time as the last survivors are older. are mixed with the quest of pages of the old testament with its difficulties of interpretation. the puzzle fall into place. i say no more. the magazine devotes read the "book of the year" is really deserved.
