madagascar 2 has a perfect picture, it is part of the blu-ray's, which for the picture can really serve as a demo until it is flawless. cot√© its is very effective in english dolby truehd 5.1 and french in dolby digital 5.1. interactivity is correct and presented in hd. track informative anecdotes about the shooting is in english without subtitles. for the film itself, i find much more successful and funnier than the first, it seems less for children.
