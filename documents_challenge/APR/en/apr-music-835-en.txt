it must be said, a rush of blood to the head is a huge disappointment ... of course, some titles are emerging, we think of the scientist and in my place, but all is well below expectations ... this is mainly due to 2 reasons: - the album "parachutes" had a real soul, a real staff (the sound of a rush is abominable production very "clean" which recalls the 80s) and real very good songs ... comparison between the 2 albums is ruthless - "a rush" had the misfortune to leave in a year or very good rock albums are legions (interpol, the hives, the supergrass, low, etc.). ... again, the comparison between this new wave of groups (even if supergrass are not brand new) and the latest coldplay is hard ... "a rush" is an album proper, square, that takes no risk, and especially taking a slap shot and old compared with very good albums this year.
