series back from the grave is one of the most renowned in garage rock and reason. focusing on a more raw, more violent, more rock-n-roll than his playmates (nuggets, pebbles, garage beat), back from the grave successfully explores this way each time offering numerous killings out of nowhere. it is a perfect addition to wishing to go further in the garage rock after discovering the nuggets, not offering almost never the same tracks as the competition. this first volume is a good vintage, one is often surprised by the quality of the pieces. among the best moments we note the cover of "psycho" by the swamp rats, even more violent and weighed as the original (and yet that they placed the bar high) tall. like "scream" by ralph nielsen and his chancellors, whose title summarizes well the philosphy implementation in the song. note also the fabulous "cry cry cry" unrelated segments of the third group from detroit, a bomb of energy that takes the guts. mention also jujus (do you understand me, during sessions of the piece have been brought a motorcycle and bottles of beer for the effects, such stories captures the spirit to work through this disc), the novas (the crusher taken by the cramps), the alarm clock (no reason to complain) and many more ... in short, the overall level has nothing to be ashamed to face nuggets, pieces are anyway more targeted . the liner notes are informative and nice, the sound quality is fair but could be better (the pieces were recovered from the vinyl and not original masters, this means, but still quite reasonable).
