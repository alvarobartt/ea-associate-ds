this reissue of beyonce's new album is much more interesting. the quality of the edition itself, and then the evolution of beyonce. it includes unreleased tracks and in general i am wary because these titles can be added too quick. here, listen to the entire album without hooks and it hangs. it has the power grip guturale lady beyonce, her musical style, and when we look at the dvd, like a very polished and colored its clips and for some, their extravagance. in short, beyonce wanted to attract the ear and voice with this new album and i think she did, because for me it is a cd not to be missed ! for once the value is excellent.
