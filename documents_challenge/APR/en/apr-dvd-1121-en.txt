i was very disappointed by this film.les dialogues are really low and sometimes ridiculous. i take for example when peter kills a wolf (which actually falls alone on his sword) and the lion says "peter terror of wolves." really ridiculous. the main actor is terribly wrong. the only really attractive is the youngest i can not remember his name, which itself dates back level. in a similar report can be generated images that are fairly successful. but despite everything i really not recommend this movie.
