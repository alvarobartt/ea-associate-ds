in 1967, pushing the experimentation of "revolver" one step further, the beatles recorded the album reference, one of the most sold around the world, and one of the inevitable. with hindsight, we say that "sergeant pepper's" is far from their best record, that these innovations (first gatefold sleeve, first words on the cover) are anecdotal. all this is true, but it overlooked how the music changed his time, and this at a time when everything changed ... the irony of the matter is that this album both eccentric and provocative, written under the influence of illicit substances, showed the world that "pop music" was a serious matter.
