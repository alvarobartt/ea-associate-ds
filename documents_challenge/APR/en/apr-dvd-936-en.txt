a man who during the war commits a crime that allows him to be spared himself. saved by the sea and rescued by orthodox monks, whom he embraces asceticism without complying with their settled existence, but it bothers plot, seeming somehow privileged by god, despite his faults, and despite her "eccentricities." .. here is the crux of the story. both for itself and for its treatment, it contains interesting tracks, mainly on development-central character in this "extraordinary" and necessarily interesting, but outside of it is rather hollow and artificial. some beautiful pictures, but too affected by contrast and saturation processing unnatural (and too common), at first glance dynamic and visually comfortable, but tiring and empty, unjustified, and then mostly shortcuts scriptwriting and a bottom fairly simplistic and annoying, a denouement introduced and shipped without finesse, and then so insistent that we mean the unusual nature of our character that eventually discredit the movie frame and the interest that could carry him. damage
