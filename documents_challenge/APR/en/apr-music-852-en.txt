an unknown group - and who wins remain anonymous - just pathetically trying to pretend to new order ... the sound of the bass hooky (tics and tips included), the nasal voice of barney, the striking metronymic morris ... but where is new order? not a title retains the attention past the intro, arrangements pompous, vulgar, tocs, words near the ridiculous attempt at reggae cry poor to the memory of "turn the heater on" ... shabby burial of a large group. avoid!
