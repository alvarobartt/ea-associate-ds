it is true that after having written "the crimson rivers" and "the flight of storks", jean-christophe grange had, i believe, released with "the stone council" which was not up to my expectations. so i was looking forward his next book to see if he could do better, and yes he did. this book is very well written. he mixes the wonderful stories of two heroes (as the author had already done in "the crimson rivers"). the story is breathtaking. so if you like detective novels with suspense, do not hesitate to order it.
