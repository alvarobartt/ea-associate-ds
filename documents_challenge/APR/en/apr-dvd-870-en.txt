this film is a turnip. the opening scene is a challenge to the laws of gravity. the girls have an iq of an oyster and humor is pathetic. we regret almost that of "is there a cop to save humanity?" that is to say. angels full throttle pity chaining them and throw them in a dungeon and you can avoid the third episode!
