i found myself as the "green album" did not make a fuss, ok "hash pipe" and "island in the sun" is nice but 2 singles behind the excellent "buddy holly" or "say it is not so "(to name a few) of the first album! pinkerton had been a little disappointed but i'm here i'm downright disgusted with having to buy a cd of just 29 minutes as a result! iron you rather "the blue album"!
