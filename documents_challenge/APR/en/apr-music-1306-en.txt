this album is unique in the discography of bob dylan, a true ufo haloed by the myth of the bootleg, so worship. it took me a long time yet before i decide to buy, but the books of greil marcus ( "mystery train" and especially "the invisible republic" which decrypts the ins and outs of the famous "basement tapes") have whetted my curiosity and caused the desire to confront such a work. musically, nothing to do with the rest of the production of dylan, these discs are a patchwork where strange musical styles collide, intermingle to give rise to strangely timeless songs (in the sense that we can date them) , sometimes chaotic, with the singular beauty of a rough diamond, some still trapped in their matrix. the multi-instrumentalists who made up the band are no strangers to reconstruct the puzzle of music alive again made of bits and pieces of the past (blues, country, antediluvian appalachian folk, polka, rock dirty ...) this gives the slendides "million dollar bash," "too much of nothing" or "crash on the levee" the feeling that grips the listener then confined to the sublime and this has something terrifying. all this may seem subjective, so i can only invite you to judge for yourself while you warmly recommending this piece of music essential to the continuation of rock'n'roll
