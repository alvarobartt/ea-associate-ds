it's been such a good cd! from anywhere means comparisons with arcade fire, to believe that everyone is lack of novelty on the part of the butler and chassagne other! well yes ac was reminiscent of arcade fire while keeping its own identity. its a very personal one that addresses not necessarily from the first listen (even if the first two songs are immediately tilt). so over the plays we enter the world of wolf parade (previous album already very good with the 'excellentissime modern world) and this is a concern, once back inside the cd ends, 45 minutes, but only 9 songs, too short, too good, two or three more songs would have been out of 6 5.
