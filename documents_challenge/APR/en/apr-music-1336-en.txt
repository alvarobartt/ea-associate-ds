sorry, it's not terrible, this starts very strong, which mixes heavy riffs and rhythm rasta flare, but the rest of the cd, we expect new inspirations of that ilk here, i'm still waiting ... i think this is selfish, and produces a "firecracker", like a trumpet, the cornet, disappointment, because the potential is always present.
