farther above. while de-loused in the comatorium hendrix combined rock, psychedelic digressions and electro samples, the new mars volta album is systematically destroying the verse-chorus pattern on pieces around a quarter of an hour. with all their musical influences and more broadly, artistic, frances the mute is the map of surrealism. cedric, singer, wears well a dali elephant tattooed on his left arm. the gallery of photographs in the booklet is in this sense: hidden drivers mirror reflecting another topic, tree unlikely. the words are the same barrel, mixed this time between spanish and english: the main influence would be a diary found by a former group member who has since died. and what about titles? twelve beaches, while the list contains six, cut into sub-parties as the heyday of progressive. finally flea and john frusciante are still part of the credits. frusicante made two solos and flea is ... the trumpet. no surprises when finally on l'via l'vasquez you pass a groovy riff to the classic salsa, or a long passage leads to an ethereal sonic flood, the voices rising ever higher. perfect continuity of de-loused in the comatorium, frances the mute it has the same power of attraction. once inside, hard to listen to something else: this mix is one even if used by cedric and omar gather there.
