george lucas is a visionary, certainly, but it is also recognized as a very bad director of actors (observe the difference in quality of play between episode iv, directed by him and two others led by other directors). and that's where the rub, because here, the ridiculous becomes almost unbearable, enjoyment even for the amateur nanars bigmacquesques. the grand finale is of course the love-scene between anakin and amidala, amid waterfall in image computed. and what about this desire to explain everything, to tell everything? the mystery is not involved does not in the aura that emanates from the first film? here, scenes grandiloquent succeed with garish aliens redundant .. yoda and who fights as if he had an overdose of "force".
