le petit prince is a book that accompanies you throughout your life. more than a story, more than new, this book is a treasure that everyone should read at least once. but now, we do not read "the little prince" once: take it up again and again and each time a new meaning, new life lesson appears between the lines. the drawings of the author are also superb, with two lines topped by a star, st exup√©ry able to express the melancholy of the world. every time we close this wonderful little book, it is wiser, richer interior and probably a little more good.
