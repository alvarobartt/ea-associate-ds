composed in 1957, the eleventh symphony shostakovich brush four tables the tragic events of the russian revolution of 1905. this fresco historical film was created october 30, 1957 by the ussr symphony orchestra directed by nathan rakhlin. it leopold stokowski who made the first recording with the orchestra of houston in 1958 (capitol-emi). a few months later, he came to direct the soviet union with the orchestra of radio and television. we hear echoes here of a concert live (h√©las. ..), captured the 09 september. the aesthetic options are essentially the same as in the studio aforesaid interpretation: a "palace square" raised with emotion and recollection, an insurgency of "nine january" brisk "a tocsin" which sounds a hectic emergency. unfortunately, the technical quality is terribly fragile: the intrusive noise of room (creaking of chairs, persistent coughing public .. .) are sometimes more audible than the music itself, especially since the orchestra is captured from a distance. the sound image appears very confused: etiolated strings, percussion relegated to limbo (the last straw for this partition. ..) finally the fun is spoiled because even if a document archive can provide comfort audiophile, listening is extremely laborious and even painful. this testimony prior exciting confrontation between a charismatic leader and an orchestra idiomatic will be reserved for unrepentant chostakovien, the compulsive collector, or pneumo-historiologue. who wants to hear a great version of "authentic" in decent conditions will turn to the versions of mravinsky, kondrashin or konwitschny.
