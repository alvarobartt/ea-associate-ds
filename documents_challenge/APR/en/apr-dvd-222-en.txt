i just purchased this dvd after watching it for rent: the beauty of achievement is amazing, and the scenario as deep and complex. to fully appreciate the flavor, it is probably necessary to have seen the first opus, which tells the "emancipation" of major motoko kusanagi. the frame of the plot hints implicitly questioning philosophical consciousness of artificial intelligence, a little line from the movie "i, robot." a movie that exudes a very special atmosphere, one can see many times without tiring. buy to recommend.
