paper nullissime and yet i am fond of this kind of literature ... unfortunately we have here a sort of gibberish that hardly incurgiter ... i forced myself. bad idea, it took me two weeks, my hard drive to find the pleasure to read. forget the roman de la rose sauce da vinci code, problem, the sauce has turned ... wrong. it is a horror. probably one of the 3 books most pathetic i have read in my entire life. we guess that the publisher wanted to ride the wave da vinci, what a shame, they obviously did not read the book before its publication. totally indigestion
