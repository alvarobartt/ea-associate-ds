nai i also never read a good book but believe me jen i am not a first! until last word of the book agatha keeps us in suspense, and the improbable happens when we really did not expect such purpose . geial! really, i think we read it to me after the best agatha christie's books in addition to being lemeilleur plot polixci√©re book, i highly recommend it!
