i selected this book somewhat haphazardly in the station to read on the train. i was captured by the summary of 4th cover. but that happiness in reading, so much so that i preferred to wait at least two days to finish the lire.echange correspondence between a man and a woman who has just discovered them, and through this course narrative moments of their lives but also through their passion for books. that exchange filled with tension, passion and concern over these letters and orders books. a real pleasure reading about these characters and their moment of life. an end as we would not have believed, but which has become meaningless. it is a book that you forget not like that, and that gave me a great desire to read the reference books that have animated so much passion between these two people.
