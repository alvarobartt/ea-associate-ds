this book is just rumor and slander, how to make money with a story that makes no sense ... i'm a fan of the doors for over 20 years and everybody knows that jim before his death was more bearded as described by the author when he saw the toilet in the circus .... no matter how jim died what matters is the heritage he left us. but making money with stories that do not stand a bearded morrison transported in a taxi in the streets of paris you think that this is reality, you believe that the taxi would have accepted the race .... sorry but i suggest you go your way .....
