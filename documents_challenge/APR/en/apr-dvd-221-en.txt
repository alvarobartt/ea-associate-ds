madagascar is like all these movies coming out in 3d for some time, no story, characters and funny gags ever worn. the animation is fluid and always sure of quality but if we confine ourselves only that we will soon get bored. and there (tired) is terribly true, the film quickly becomes heavy and indigestible, and it surprised even looking at his watch, praying that the film finally ends without our little upset that they can still have fun few aftershocks felt very variably.
