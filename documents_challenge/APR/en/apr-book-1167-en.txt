i start the fantasy for a very short (barely a month) and this is only my second book of its kind. i have chosen for its "dark" unlike my first book was rather "heroic". well i was very pleasantly surprised. the writing is sharp, sometimes vulgar and violent (typical of the kind "dark") and really gives the impression of being a write to the heat of battle. the history and the roles of the characters are very difficult to follow during the first 150 pages, then everything becomes clear when one is accustomed to writing. at the end of book one wants to know more, there is no doubt! too bad this book is in paperback, the reading is less friendly ...
