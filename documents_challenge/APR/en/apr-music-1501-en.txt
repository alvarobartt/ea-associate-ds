i admit i'm confused with music by ja rule. while we were treated to an excellent debut album, venni vetti vecci, hardcore, violent, brutal and masterful, his two subsequent albums have seen drastic change of register. mixing rap with hardcore syrupy r &amp; b, ja rule has delivered excellent songs like "always on time" with the beautiful ashanti. but because of too abuse this mixture, its songs eventually become weaklings. for this 4th album, whose title was directly related to the bible and christ, i hoped that ja rule would return to a report sharper, more personal, more tormented, more somber. i admit that the cover, ultra-gothic, i instantly made me want to buy this opus. but at first listen, you can feel how his music is soften. from "thug lovin '" song still passable thanks to the participation of bobby brown, to the ridiculous "mezmerized", we said that ja rule has really formatted talent to go into radio. he plays outright lovers to nelly, not even sure as such in this role. the evidence is that refugees soup behind a visually striking, as shown in the album cover. the evidence also that appearances can be deceptive.
