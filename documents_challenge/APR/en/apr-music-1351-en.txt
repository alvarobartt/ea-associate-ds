if some think that ny and returning shows regular foil detox smartest, is a pale replica of u.s. fire "sir elton" ..... they are wrong. talented musician, excellent showman (fasting), billy joel wrote a very beautiful and simple songs that i think "just the way you are", dedicated to the beloved and to cosmetic surgery ... is one of the jewels. still, this pianist capable of ecir "big shot", "zanzibar", "street life serenade" (absent the first two cities !!!!) this double compilation is also capable of writing such unpalatable syrups "honesty", or énnervantes and variétoches songs like "uptown girl". i am not a specialist "so young" joel, but this compilation has all the faults of those other artists like pet gab, or of supertramp here does not! no cohesion, leaders of eouvre cotoient of abominable nonsense, and we fall asleep before the disappointing box surprises, which quickly became a box to slap both songs enchainent no surprises, no zest, no bonus live version or stripped all this vile production syrupy! i am sure bj piano alone, like randy newman, it must be nice. i think a simple compile more focused on shorter pieces, more solid, all need not crawl the entire career of joel, who has badly over would suffice! totally unnecessary.
