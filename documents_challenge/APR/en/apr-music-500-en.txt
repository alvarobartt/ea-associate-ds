already the cover was too ugly. without doubt the worse for maiden. then the production is just acceptable. from "fear of the dark" (the last "true" maiden), you sink more and more. we can not say it is bad, but it completely obscures the side heavy group. too homogeneous, frieze by the time the slurry noise. finally, the music is very average, see any. despite good passages ( "no more lies", "paschendale "...), and two pieces rather successful (" rainmaker "and" journeyman "which, oddly, is not at all in the style of maiden), iron maiden demonstrated a serious lack of inspiration. only fans (like me) will appreciate this album.
