i noticed that i was part of the group of players, guys who bought "the rule of four" by ian caldwell et al. (but in english, in my case) from the novel by philip knight "the ogre of the ganges," let me make a comparison i find that "the ogre of the ganges" is a book much more original and intelligent. i agree with those who think "the rule of four" before any attempt to "surf" the wave of success of "da vinci code" and the fireworks used by the authors (including seeking style more "literary" than dan brown) can not hide this fact.
