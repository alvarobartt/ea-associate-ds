this film gans is spectacular but rather extreme in his style: the historical context is revisited, modernized agement kung-fu ... for my part, i loved it because even if the achievement is sometimes sluggish, with particular many slow motion effects, the film itself is a small revolution (french, more), with a cast and an impressive sound and visual quality rare. this is perhaps not the film's most subtle and more realistic we've seen but it is an ambitious film, dramatic and effective. the only fault i find untenable is the realization of the famous beast ... we see clearly a creature out of a program, moderated a bit like the fake monsters of horror films 70s. amid all beautifully done, it really does work. but hey, this is a (big) detail.
