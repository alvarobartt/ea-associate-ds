initially, the synopsis is quite interesting mercenaries confronted a gang of nazi soldiers "ghosts" - it moves away from the classical canons of modern survival (a family or a couple of teenagers in conflict with one or psychopaths , against a backdrop of wilderness, even if this film is also setting a bunker in the forest). then they said that ultimately the idea is quite preposterous (to plagiarize someone's vocabulary ...), or crazy. and in addition, the machine to stop these ghost soldiers crashes (yes ben dating from the end of the war anyway ...). finally, a fairly average film.
