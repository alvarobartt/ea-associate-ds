a miyasaki, we do not go backwards. so a light heart and with the certainty of a good cartoon that i went to see this new weapon is the king of ghibli. i was not disappointed, castle street, adaptation of howl's moving castle, british children's novel is indeed good miyasaki. it is first transported by drawing and inventive visuals: aging and rejuvenation of snapshots, a bourgeois turning into piles of flesh, flames speaking, a truly magical magician himself, walking a castle-like steampunk julesvernienne infernal machine, etc.. we also found the themes dear to the master: irrational use of violence, the absurdity of war, pure vision and (overly) idealized childhood. reading levels are numerous. unfortunately, this is where the saddles hurt: we found a little too everything that makes a miyasaki: platonic love and vaguely precious, innocent youth and adult victim always a threat of evil with a capital m. the characters in force having psyches fairly simple - if not inconsistent, eventually all look alike: that sophie is really a different chihiro, haku hauru one? the charge is a bit cruel, but the unique style of da miyasaki eventually get tired.
