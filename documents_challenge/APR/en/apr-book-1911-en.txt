like many i read this book in me based on his reputation and his critics. the story starts well and enough rhythm is maintained throughout. however, the characters are much too superficial, there are several passages where the question arises whether the author really knows what he is talking and also rehearsals. the detective story is not bad but the mix art-religion-history leaves much to be desired, especially because dan brown is not very credible in his descriptions (paris, london, the vatican, etc. ...) and his theories. it seems that this book was mainly written with hollywood in mind and it is not surprising that the film will be shot soon.
