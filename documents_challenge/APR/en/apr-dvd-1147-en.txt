the simpsons "horror show" is a compilation 'halloween special. the summary of the party ... every year an episode is created by matt groening &amp; i love the old episodes. so i am obviously delighted that this little collection is available for sale, this compiles' contains 4 episodes great. each of them contains 4 mini shows! : treehouse of horror v "the shining," a tribute to the horror classic. "time and punishment," where homer travels through time thanks to a toaster. "nightmare caf√©," where the school team perfects the art of serving the student body! treehouse of horror vi "attack of the 50 foot eyesore," where the pub has its revenge. "nightmare on evergreen terrace" where willy scots take the role of freddy. "homer3" where homer visits the third dimension. treehouse of horror vii "the thing and i" shows the twin brother of bart! "the genesis tub" lisa is the creator of a little tiny world. "mr. kang goes to washington" where kang &amp; kodo take the form of bob dole &amp; bill clinton, just in time for elections! treehouse of horror xii "hex and the city" where a gypsy enchants everyone loveth homer. "house of whacks" where e simpsons live in a house / computer. "wiz kids" is another homage to the first harry potter movie. the animation for the selection of episodes is a bit slow as you could bvoirou the verrr ... was better in the other dvd but it's not serious i / we love the simpsons (family crazy) and all their adventures, so it is better to prefer a dvd quyi starts a bit slowly but we will for the company eternity (super video support) to a vhs whose life is much less!! &amp; then here, the episodes are longer because they are not censored by the u.s. television! these scenes longer then add another dimension to the 4 episodes so my advice is to treat you with these animated gems! feel free to get the whole collection (i did you can too !!!)... good show &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nelly
