the first thriller grang√©, and remained somewhat unknown, it has now rightly the effect of "crimson rivers" and heavily prefigures the singular style of the author and his recurring themes. i read it after discovering the "crimson rivers" and the "stone council" and "l'empire des loups" and frankly, i think i will place in mind. the lead of departure tenuous lead on a double plot particularly well done, rich and complex. unlike books which started strong but soon withers the frame, it must instead return gradually learn it for the plot reaches its real dimension after the first third of the novel, in a progressive intensity and irresistible . the "african" novel is particularly well done, with its terrible atmosphere and wish to oppression. bravo for the denouement, in my opinion far better controlled than in the "stone council" and "the empire of wolves", a bit disappointing on this point. in terms of (small) criticism, we would have liked to know more about the connections between certain characters, but all remains impeccably conducted.
