i believed, wrongly, that this film was an adaptation of the wonderful trilogy by mary o'hara (my friend flicka - the son of flicka - green grass of wyoming). what i was not surprised that the girl in the jacket was actually the main character, replacing kenneth mclaughlin young ... then to see that apart from the name of the mare and some characters, and the location in wyoming, there is nothing in common with the books ... not to mention a horse apparently died during shooting, and others have been abused. impression finals: the director has used the popularity of the novel while not hesitating to denature, for purely commercial. big disappointment.
