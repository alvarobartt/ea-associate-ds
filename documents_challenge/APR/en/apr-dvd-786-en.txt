faithful adaptation of a book allegedly autobiographical which the author (now it must be said author) finally admits not without first having made the rounds of tv dinners and radio stations and not without having sold the rights to the cinema - it was just fabrications. clearly, in view of the drawing reveals that the number of suckers who believe that a child could walk barefoot 3000 kilometers by 10 Â° during the war and no food is high (and i do not even speak of "the 'adoption' by wolves ...). i said "faithful adaptation". the novel being a turnip, i confirm, the film is faithful.
