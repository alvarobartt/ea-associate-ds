the swamp blues slim harpo is less "deep" than lightnin slim, but not less attractive. its first titles are well known for having been taken by many british bands including the stones - king bee. but records from the end of his career - gathered here - are equally successful: how to resist tip on in, you cannot make it, got to be with you tonight, etc. - should be almost all mentioned. really great.
