the worst batman the whole series, and from afar. a very bad game players, a numbing music, costumes and ridiculous kitsch, villains grotesque, appalling replicas (freeze, you're frosted? freez hi i'm batman !!!!!). treat the black knight so is an insult. george clooney already trained al 'time for advertising nespresso, and uma thurman kill bill should go back and redo the great schwarzenegger a terminator. only consolation is so bad that this shuttle becomes comical. review both tim burton and batman begins, fly schumacher is definitely a very bad director.
