not this album is not the best of muse and far away ... the "his" own to muse disappeared, instead of music that is formatted to please the greatest number. muse is one of my favorite bands (with 2 first album) but they have lost their courage and their rock side. you feel it, also. those who say that this third album is the best and most successful are not real fans of muse. muse was lost. too bad they were nevertheless a good start ...
