i love this author but this book disappointed me. the idea is good or very good, but it lacks strength, power, it does not mark asser ... it tells us that this show is supposed to reproduce the exact conditions of concentration camps when we are away from the horror of reality. short, this book is convincing, it would have been, in my opinion, far more shocking as it used to do in some of his other books. too bad she has had at least worth trying!
