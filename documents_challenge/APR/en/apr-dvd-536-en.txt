editor dvd universal is lamentable. the sound volume is still low as in the first season. but in addition the image has not been reworked resulting in image quality dull, gray, colorless, scenes or you can not see the faces of the characters and scenes very dark day barely legible (l action takes place in hawaii anyway). season 1 had this problem of image quality. it's a waste because magnum is a series of legends and society is totally universal jurisdiction to restore his true valeur.a not buy love and yet magnum.
