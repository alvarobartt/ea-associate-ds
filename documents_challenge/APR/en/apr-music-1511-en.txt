once again the alto saxophonist gives us a very very large disk. each of the six pieces is a real jewel: quality of improvisation, work on sounds, group cohesion. phil woods is well surrounded with piano great jaki byard, richard davis on bass and alan dawson on drums. the perfect disc. a beautiful composition of woods to begin "samba du bois" (included as a bonus at the end on another tempo), a wonderful "willow weep for me", a very nice version of the wayne shorter composition "nefertiti "another composition woods very original. a very beautiful ballad by michel legrand. finally "airegin" rollins removed and tempo control. an album that account in the extensive discography of phil woods. this is a reprint by pony canyon in an album recorded in 1974 under this title for the firm "muse" (since disappeared) that has burned, especially in the '70s, plenty of good jazz records. some were taken by the firm "32jazz" (a criterion of quality, but also missing). it was their 1997 edition that i own: registration is very good. i hope that is the case for this reissue by the other label.
