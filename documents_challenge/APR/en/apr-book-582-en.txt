like many critics of his advisers, i thought it would be good ... what a disappointment on arrival, i still can not see where the story of montespan has any interest ... not only his adventures are meaningless (actually the only real event if we can say is transormation a carriage ...), but the writing style i do not transcended .. . several passages are raw and do nothing. it is better to spend a good evening.
