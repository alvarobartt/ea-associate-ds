extras, judging the best metallica album, almost 20 years before (1986) the "head banger" were in top form, they did an exellent album, very technical, beautiful compositions (battery, lepper messiah), aggressive. very different from other albums (besides metallica albums are all different). with the last of cliff burton shows his talent, a james hatfield who hits hard (to believe that fire will kill us), the lars ulrich very bad and last but not least, lee kirk hammet who was at his peak. an album highly recommended thrash.they addicts never stop because they are metallica
