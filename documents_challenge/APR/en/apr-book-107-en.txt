if i had read as teenagers, it would have probably liked. it is also published in collections "young adults". but with age, it's hard to believe this kind of simplistic history with one side a simple love story and another manichean criticism of the powerful who cause the apocalypse. a note, barjavel had originally wrote this script for a film (never completed).
