i really like bjork ... but there ... nothing to do. this is not an album, in any case, it seems that it is not completed. we only hear sounds shrill chorus accompanied by making the atmosphere even more morbid. i understand that it may please some, but frankly ... apart completely drunk, it's unlistenable.
