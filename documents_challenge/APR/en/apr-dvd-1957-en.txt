i just discovered vandread and i think it's a good anime even if 3d is not always great, but you get used to. so i filled in for the purchase and it is true that the season 1, the ad is "misleading" if i may say, that's why i check every time. as for my future purchase, i am disappointed because there is only the box 2 which is in g and that are best animated by vostfr. so i decided to wait until they are both in vostfr, hoping that it happens quickly.
