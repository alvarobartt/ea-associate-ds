i have great admiration for nathalie dessay, but this disc does not (or no longer) the vocal qualities one expects (or expected) it. the vocal technique is insufficient: the high notes are winded, the vocals stuck, can not understand a word in three. no rhythm, no flamboyance, no radiation, no rhetoric, no intention musical accompaniment grayish concert d'astrée. listen to christine schäffer with goebbels or caroline sampson suzuki: day and night. maybe i am too in my comments, but i think they are the measure of my disappointment.
