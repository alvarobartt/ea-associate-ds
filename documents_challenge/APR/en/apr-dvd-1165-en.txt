no surprise on my side, i am annoyed at this new batman, a bill very dark. because does not laugh all day in the life of bruce wayne. that said, it's hard to complain because it is still strongly dislike. it is unfortunate indeed. the woman in his life appears with the second hero of gotham, who does not hide behind a mask because it is the new prosecutor. it is beautiful, intelligent, and he has the energy and the nerve that goes with the job. a bad guy - even though the boundaries between good guys and bad guys are very mobile - the side of evil, therefore, a conspiracy and the joker, who do not improve with time. the joker wants batman, the criminals want their money, bruce and rachel will get hung up his suit, the attorney wants to put all this little world behind bars, and our dear rachel wondered if she wants to wait until bruce had finished playing the masked hero or if she wants to marry her beautiful blond left to become a widow in the days that follow. i'm not clinging to the romantic plot, the joker deeply annoys me (and it's criminal to hide behind heath ledger this atrocious makeup!), and caricature of cops and robbers agreed to desire. short. the only thing that amuses me yet, as so often in movies of superheroes from iron man to lara croft, it is the followers who act behind the scenes (michael cain and morgan freeman, no less). and for once, i wonder how a man so arrogant, selfish and egocentric that bruce wayne has been the focus of affection and friendship of those two, but they are formidable in their respective roles of nanny and conscience.
