probably great for lovers of barbara cartland and readers gala. barely out of tetralogy of pendragon cycle, i had great difficulty completing this affectation. the heroine who immediately falls in love with her abductor, a barbarian tall, muscular, with blue eyes. but bloodthirsty barbarian who took care not to rush. without forgetting the loyal second, a large black muscled the stentorian voice ... in addition, it has nothing to do with the fantasy. no great destiny, no world to save, no magic, no special creature. just a love story completely grotesque. ugh!
