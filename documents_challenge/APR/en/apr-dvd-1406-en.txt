missed. but i wanted to love - and besides it is not all bad: the scenario is no worse than another, schwartzy quite equal to itself, the touches of humor (especially with d√©calcage t2 - see the clothing collection by the terminator - these glasses! - replies referential ...) but: - a main actor, nick stahl, transparent and too different (in character even more than physical) character of edward furlong - a claire danes annoying, almost to slap (although it is an actress i like more) - a terminator "unconvincing and badly played: it is clear that the actress gives a lot of dog for play "machine", but on the other side of the balance she smiles and other facial expressions all too human - and especially an achievement well below the standard cameron missed unfortunately.
