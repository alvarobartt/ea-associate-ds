a pale imitation of the fantastic adventures of anita blake (at least the first volumes) ... and imitation is an understatement! everything is there, the seductive vampire, the lycanthrope lover, the heroine supernatural powers, a few skits ... but bloody sauce &amp; candy care bears! satisfactory only if you do not know laurell k. hamilton or if you are new vampires, zombies &amp; other creatures!
