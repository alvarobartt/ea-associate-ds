voulzy fan, i am disappointed with this new cd which will voulzy striking plates in his talent again. the musical quality is there but no innovation. for summer evenings it is nice but it must lawrence found his talent and make us a cd worthy of him. i'd like to find the artist who gave us a final tour at the height of his talent and his generosity. we quickly forget this cd as well as the penultimate.
