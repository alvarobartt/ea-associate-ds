this book is excellent to begin in visualbasic. (long ago, i had made procedural programming, but never with such development tools). with this book, the process is very gradual and very educational. nothing is forgotten, just follow and strictly enforce what is described. and it progresses slowly. to advise beginners. it is likely that those who have already used the visualbasic or some programming may find the approach too simplistic. but it is equally certain not to lose.
