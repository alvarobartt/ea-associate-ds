yes, well ... it seems obvious to rent tarentinesque style ... personally, i liked "kill bill", completely in the parody at the same time truly spectacular ... and even scratching one could find meaning (the mother lioness ...). in short, a delight, and attestation that tarantino is a talented fed on b-movies he has a pearl in two volumes. but "pulp fiction" ... frankly ... how to get excited for this little thing indeed shifted slightly, albeit sometimes delightfully humorous indeed played brilliantly (travolta / thurmann etc. ...), but not enough to break two (three? ;-)) feet to a duck .. . frankly, how to get excited for these sequences that never end for these dialogues dishes like a hamburger came under the wheels of a truck u.s. ... i know, i know, this platitude is fun ... but sometimes, sorry, this platitude is simply ... flat! i know, i know, "pulp fiction" means "soap bullets at 2" (printed on cheap paper), but that's the film that one striker ... the famous "play" with the timing (back to the beginning to the end ...), there is no room for complacency in engineering ... it's as simple as an exercise in style in a film class ... tarantino is also a godsend for the teacher of cinoche is practical and effective ... may there to excite the viewer, there is margin. however, whereas there is no smoke without fire, and on amazon of praise without reason (as commentators have talent and culture ...) then i consent to admit that i gourre ... and i take time one day to see "pulp fiction" (that said, there are so many good films to see that tell a story ... i'm afraid this is not immediately ...) .
