having devoured the first volume in praying that the second is also, if not better, here i am diving in the second volume. the story continues, painfully, it dragged on the display that makes the author's learn eventually no longer be deceived and we catch ourselves looking forward to the outcome, we hope after such a great pad. but alas! the ending is disappointing, just a storm in a teacup! instead of a scene breathtaking that would not have been regretting the purchase, we are late with a more bland and slightly grotesque .... no, really, closing the book, you say " all for it! "do not buy it, take it! and yet, if you love good books, you can miss without remorse!
