nile has changed publishing. you say "nuclear blast" in general is good. nile is american. nb and there must have been intended to explore the nile german public. who knows why the german public knows egypt (see indiana jones). on balance: a warm soup, without inspiration, without the song or songs that turn any production nile in organized killing proto-lovecraftian. or concept "prog" with the brutal deathm√© of 17 minutes a piece. i am very disappointed, and i expect 2009.
