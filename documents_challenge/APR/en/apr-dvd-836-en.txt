a great action movie that involves a professional killer in the streets of bangkok. he is deaf and dumb, violent and ruthless. the love of a woman can he save him? let yourself be carried away by the intense atmosphere which prevails hatred, suffering but also tenderness and love. the acting is sensational and the scenes breathtaking. this film is spectacular and the dvd transcribed perfectly ... it's like the movies! note however it is not recommended for sensitive souls. for others, it is to view it without moderation!
