seen on the u.s. version here is a short film that went unnoticed to the merit of your entertainment, without fuss and no big bang special effects. it follows the wanderings of all players with a lot of fun and even if history is a little convoluted, chris evans is not his biceps (a sort of harry potter, whose power is immense but do not know in advance) and dakota fanning a teenager full of charm and nonchalance. i think a suite is scheduled for the end is very open and makes you want to know more. the image is fluid and colorful, dark scenes are not numerous nickel, the soundtrack without demonic ensures the minimum union. all my public opinion
