a beautiful picture for this mythical concert in london in 1994, rich sound remaster in dolby digital 5.1 / 448 kbps and 640 kbps, which blew up your subwoofer with bitter effects that puts you first. small disappointment for the lower target of sid pryce under dimentionner on another brick in the wall but we forgive them necessarily.
