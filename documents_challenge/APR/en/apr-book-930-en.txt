album difficult to obtain and disappointment in his reading. there is no real history, exchanges between the characters are rather distressing. a reading one gets the impression that some designs are added to complete the page. and the quality of the design is totally inconsistent. the faces of alice and enak are sometimes unrecognizable from one plate to another. in short an album that you can avoid buying even for unconditional alix.
