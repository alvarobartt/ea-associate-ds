films of jj annaud, they are talking animals (contextually, not with the voice ...) explore a range of human emotions. these same traits is sometimes slightly lacking on the majority of hollywood blockbusters. so we are following these two tigers since they were captured, while their mother has just been shot by hunters and the young are separated and we see education alongside their respective diametrically opposed to each other. then we see then a turnaround not provided by man. yes! this film could be commonplace conceals hidden treasures of suspense and revelations ... the animal known to be clever sometimes. say it is not known hatred as we know, that fight and kill for food or to survive, not for pleasure ... it's fun to see how a fictional animal can be so revealing of human folly. i even made a small larmichette is so beautiful. a film so successful, in sumptuous settings, characters beautifully encamped, animals trained to a quarter-hair calf ant and history accessible to young and old ... chapeau, mr. annaud!
