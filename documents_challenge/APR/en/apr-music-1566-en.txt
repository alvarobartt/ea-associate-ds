with the new album from john mayall we are no longer in the former but squarely in history. it would be time to arrange the unesco heritage before it is too late because grandpa was 76 years anyway. two years ago we had delivered an excellent tribute to freddie king (in the palace of the king) full of tone, now his new album tough deserves less praise. everything is a bit diluted. the music is always the blues but with a bit of this and a bit of it by the songs and musicians have no talent of distinguished elders who preceded them alongside the master of british blues, particularly guitarist rocky athas rather colorless. it is still some good moments like an eye for an eye with mayall on piano, the great slow train to nowhere slow blues topped with organ and on the whole cd all the interventions in the old harmonica which closes on the abducted the sum of something. a disk minor for the great john mayall. note the beautiful pictures of the booklet.
