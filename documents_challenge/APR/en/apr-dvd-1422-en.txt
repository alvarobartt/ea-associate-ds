the film is set during the normandy landings, which is shown in all its horror, but also in all its reality, and that's what makes the strength of this film, reality! effect handheld camera we saw the battle instead of seeing them, as we feel what the soldier feels, as one sees what he sees, and as we hear what he hears. the actors are very good, sound is excellent and the images of outstanding quality.
