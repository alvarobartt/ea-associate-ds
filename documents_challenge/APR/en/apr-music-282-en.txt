zazie we were surprised (pleasantly) with rodeo back after a double platinum album with his new totem. an intimate album so sad but beautiful. rails: 1 from the album a song about the snowball effect to the text nice and frenzied melody. i am a man: probably the best song of the album a full hard on humanity beautifully set to music. angel injured: a song of course a bit linear but with a nice text and which leaves listen jet lag: a very good song but is it necessary to take the words literally or see a song about drugs? ca: beautiful melancholy song about love lost snif beautiful it duet is the song that i like so i do not know why but i find it very original na: song very nice and very rhythmic dance, a pleasant surprise flower power: a beautiful song about courage and the will to recover whatever happens totem: rhythmic song and very naughty on the ideal man 07 dec.: each zazie album there is a worship song and beautiful that makes you shed a tear 07 dec. this is the one i was there one of the greatest texts ever composed zazie does not consider this as too soon, c 'is a real gem yin yang: song to the rhythm very nice song that moves view of the sky: to close this album a sweet and beautiful song that plays with quiet pleasure in saying that this is the last in a summary very good album that is not a big surprise. zazie is in line with his previous opus. never change a winning team and so much better. a new master-stroke which proves once again that zazie is part of the french musical landscape. note the collector's version with a beautiful booklet of 68 pages of photos and a mini cd a little gadget i must admit.
