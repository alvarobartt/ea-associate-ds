these few lines are more the form of a warning than a comment on this book in itself. indeed, the series of books published on "indigo children" is the work of the sect kryon (kryon in french) still unknown in france, but none the less dangerous, for it conveys the ideas and method of recruitment, focused primarily on families with children with dyslexia, making parents believe that the handicap of the child made him an "elected" and that only a "therapist" (member of the sect and formed by it) may help to use his special and spiritual upliftment as well. many websites prevention cons sects relate this phenomenon ( "pr√©vensectes", for example) regularly publish articles warning. moreover, if we go on the official website of the sect, one is faced with a similar configuration to that establishment on that of the church of scientology, which reflects the same processes used to "lure" the customer. a little honest approach so ... do not trap.
