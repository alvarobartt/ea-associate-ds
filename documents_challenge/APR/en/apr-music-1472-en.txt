if you want good albert collins or just good blues you have to go through this album. it is not only very varied (ca pass boogies frenzied as master charge has slower tracks more intimate as cold, cold feeling) but he shows so much play, the style of albert collins is unique: you don ' 've only heard ice pickin 'for example you know it. it's really cool that this guy there is, i fell in love with his music tt now!
