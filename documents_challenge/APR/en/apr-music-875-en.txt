the problem with this type of album is where it is positioned. if it refers to the glorious past of the group and if one remembers the sound of worship albums that are "burn" in rock n "or" machine head "can not be that disappointed. if we consider that this album is part of a trend towards a heavier sound more in tune with the times, why not. but what was one of the strengths of the group, the balance between rhythm and keyboards seems broken. lord keyboards are too discrete and found a little magic of time spent in the last song "dead or alive." the voice of gilian has lost power seems tired. blackmore's guitar is there, fortunately. no melody n'accroche, we do not retain much. we must listen better "rapture of the deep" which revives a tradition.
