hard to leave a comment after a mixed constellation of stars and enthusiastic yet the king has left me rather skeptical. the film begins and already captures the attention, lully remembers his life at court, its relations with moli√®re and the king. the sets are successful, the lavish costumes. but very quickly, the interest is slowing. not because of the history we are busy we recount (but what story? the king, lully?) but rather the annoyance of seeing the actors on the play-hysterical characters and without finesse. and there, the viewer falls into boredom and irritation, especially as the dialogues are in keeping. fortunately there is the provision of colette emmanuelle in the role of anne of austria. for that she is my star. the rest is bullshit pseudo-historical and eye-catching that can not fill the emptiness you feel after the vision of this film.
