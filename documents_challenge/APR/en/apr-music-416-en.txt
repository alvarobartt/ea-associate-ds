revisited and completed version of the fabulous album band of gypsys. this extension of the opus has been reworked to mixing, neutralizing the strike force of buddy miles and the "nasty funk" cox on bass in favor of a monologue hendrix on guitar, which loses its original transcendence ... . soooo sad! then you sort things to stay with the single band of gypsys polydor years.
