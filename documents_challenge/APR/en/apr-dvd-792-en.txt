chereau accustomed us to give us characters tormented. here, the two heroes are still. but unlike other films, they do not speak. they do not understand and neither do we. we find ourselves alone with their physical union the more sober it is free. no excesses of pleasure, just two bodies touch. the staging is the best we've ever done on the union of two people. a film that devours itself, where one looks in vain for the answer to "why?". the hero does not respond, chereau either. the result is far from them, yet they function as catalysts of our questions about the couple. they are the ones that finally we pose the question. intimacy says nothing, reveals nothing about being is alone against the other, always. pessimistic, disturbing and beautiful.
