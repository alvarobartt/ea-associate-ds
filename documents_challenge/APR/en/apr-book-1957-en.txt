on a basic postulate attractive, we expect a plot really terrible. the final was disappointing, implausible and without real impact. this novel is not unpleasant, just anecdotal. the author simply does not draw its full potential, far from it. can be read to leave on a train or on the beach, nothing more. in the vein of harlan coben novels but with less kit.
