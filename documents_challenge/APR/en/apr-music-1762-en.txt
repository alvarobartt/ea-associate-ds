i knew by the evanescence of intermediate radio with this magnificent piece bring me to life ki made me think all at once a lacuna coil (the voice of amy lee) and then was the same as linkin park.puis j i bought the album there is little time, i found it really great, it is quite varied from soft music (my immortal) to its gothic (or haunted whisper) then the neo-metal, a kind of mixture of lacuna coil and linkin park (bring me to life). in short this album and awesome and i expected one thing ...... the next!
