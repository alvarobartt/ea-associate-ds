a book to be read to children under 5 years before bedtime, which has scared my kid, who has a moral that i did not catch: the ladybug is beautiful and nice, and it becomes ugly and nasty ( so if it is nice and beautiful if it is ugly nasty ... never mind the ugly of the planet), and keep you well, ugly is: curly hair and big nose. good. the mother of the crying because the ladybird beetle is bad, and then she cries again because the beetles is again nice (and nice of course). between explain that frizzy hair became so ugly that the witch is not horrible, and why the mother cries (another source of anxiety for my kid) ... hard disk reading at night. we did not expect given the title rosewater "beautiful lady beetle. it looks cute and cuddly until we look at the pictures inside and read it ... frankly fetched as storytelling, and more. it really gives the impression that the designer did not know quite what to invent. if you want the same author a book more pleasant: "the garden of the youngest elf" is very well done to my taste.
