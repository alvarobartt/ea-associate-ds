the compositions on this cd are exemplary as well as being pleasing to the ear, they have a transformative power on the whole being of the listener. their apparent simplicity allows the listener a deeper inner peace while still present in his body rather than unconscious level, on the fantastic melodies that are sure to travel but rarely do you bring back to earth. any person who has never heard of tibetan bowls will be amazed by the sounds they emit and their vibrations that go beyond sound, beyond the mind. thanks to dean and walter for the great work!
