apart from a couple of funny gags (the scene of coke), this film picks up miserably. the comic verbal or muddy situation from beginning to end, at best cumbersome, and rare smiles that tears us somehow are anthology pieces plagiarized from the city of fear (dialogues by idling example). the script itself is totally devoid of interest, and is not absurd enough to be fun, unlike that of his glorious inspiration (city of fear), whose plot is near. attention turnip.
