a big disappointment after the brilliant "paul in his life," yvette's campaign is dirty and sad, it does not come out of walls glaucous, gestures are intended to kill, cut the campaign as i have known in my childhood, with its brutality, its plastic everywhere this campaign that destroyed most honored see it all differently. the hero of the documentary grumble incessantly, there is no joy in this family, but yvette is truly beautiful. the harsh images very pale, lack of depth of discourse. we bored from start to feel fin.ca depression. i found this movie violent, animals are killed by people violent and ruthless. the pleasure of the brother of yvette when placing traps foxes, his pride is unhealthy. a short film i did not keep. paul bedel in "paul in his life" or "modern life" is something else, then those i keep for my children and my grandchildren. yvette not god!
