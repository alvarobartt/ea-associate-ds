with this concert at carnegie, is the dream of a life that took shape for this cuban collective behind the revival, and even some popular latin music. actually, this live is probably even stronger than the studio album that allowed the consecration of buena vista. apart from the undeniable virtuosity of the musicians, it feels so palpable alchemy that creates them through this together. the public is not deceived. it's beautiful and will remain as an exceptional testimony to the impression left by cumpay segundo and his acolytes.
