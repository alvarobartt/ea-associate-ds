if you have the opportunity to see the version with jacques weber and daniel sorano (which is tough because there is no dvd yet, but you can find the old record k7 ...), you throw above. but ... ... do not waste 2 hours to see this version. the intepretation (if one can speak of interpretation) of g√©rard depardieu is an insult to the character of edmond rostand. if you can not see another version, a board, read the play and you make your own image of the character it will be a thousand times better than we "offer" depardieu.
