this film is without doubt one of the best films i have ever seen in recent years ... the benefits of nicole kidman, julianne moore and meryl streep are impeccable. one can also note the overwhelming presence of ed harris, who plays his role perfectly. cunningham's book is already a huge success (fully deserved and consistently awarded the prestigious 1999 pulitzer prize and pen / faulkner, no less!) the film has taken a heavy bet to be the height of the book. bet won! the destinies of three women (and men) we offer a range of personalities, each more realistic one than the other, giving us the worst and the best of the human condition, while maintaining a huge poetry in the sequence of scenes and stories ... this dvd is well worth the 10 dollars that you must pay to receive home and spend 2 hours of pure joy (and true emotion)!
