no argument, no precise age for the child if the child is 1 year before and after 1 year, examples from his only personal experience with her children, as if that was enough to have raised children to give lessons, one leitmotif let the children cry because crying is beneficial to health and if your baby does not cry? that it is psychological danger! this book is far from convincing me, especially because of its lack of foundation and ultimately i find it disturbing.
