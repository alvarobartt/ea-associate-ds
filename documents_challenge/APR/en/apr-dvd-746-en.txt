the dvd also contains an english audiotrack. great, i have been waiting for years to have this louis de funes - movie at home. in my opinion, this movie is far the best of all funes-productions. for my german fellows: there is no german audiotrack on this dvd, but if your level of fran√ßais is even only intermediate, just buy this (you will miss the "hirnsausen", but the original french or even the francais version of the scene makes you laughing out loud rolling on the floor!). once again - a great, great movie!
