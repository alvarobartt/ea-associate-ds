i discovered the prolific ryan adams with his two albums gold (new york, new york) and demolition (with the brilliant nuclear). but it really personally with this album that the artist has taken all its dimensions. in a voluntary exercise in style, ryan adams demonstrates the breadth of his talent to compose songs of pure rock like few artists yet stamped "greatest rock band in the world" know still do! the whole album is a great achievement of rough this is it the soaring anybody want to take me home, via the fabulous so alive luminol (great!) and burning photographs. an album of reference that has every chance of becoming a classic.
