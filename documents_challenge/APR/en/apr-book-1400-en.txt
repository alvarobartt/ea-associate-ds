i was 15 when i read this book (i'm 23 now), the same age as the heroine, if i remember correctly. it is the story of a young girl, who was linked to an intense friendship with another of his comrades. they shared everything together and most importantly, their relationship is an outlet for his family despair: the girl lives alone with his mother forbade him everything. she finds her mate in a confidant outstanding until everything changes ... a beautiful story of friendship between two young girls, and a surprising love story between a girl and her mother despite the psychological abuse which the young girl is the victim. it was a book that my grandmother wanted me to share, i've never forgotten.
