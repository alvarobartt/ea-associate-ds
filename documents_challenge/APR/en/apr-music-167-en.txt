avril lavigne how could she fall so low? after two very good albums (which were not written by him as has long claimed but what they were really good) i discovered the horrible video for "girlfriend" on tv (where it seeks by all means to bite the guy a redhead unfortunate sending him golf balls in the g *****)... and then i read an interview with her, miniskirt, panda eyes and stiletto heel, where she describes "+ woman + mature" ... i listened to excerpts of his album, all pink + one other ... i know it comes to marriage and that love makes blind but the young rocker turned into vulgar pouffe! that's the maturity?
