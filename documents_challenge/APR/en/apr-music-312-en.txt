the artist duo exudes a bewitching music, rather restrained in the amount of notes played but without deep and rich in melody and harmony sound. a slow tempo, perfectly adapted to penetrate the depths explored by their music, it flies in the depths of a universe a bit dark at times, but beautiful. to recommend to those who want to escape for a moment the excitement of their life too hectic and regain some calm waters of a mountain lake.
