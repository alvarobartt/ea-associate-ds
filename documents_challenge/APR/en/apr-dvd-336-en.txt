"but what's that thing?" here we can say after watching this movie unlikely, whose moral is "be careful, you pollute the planet and it's wrong." it is certain that if every time a human polluted earth, a giant bioman landed, it would be invaded. script nonexistent, taking on a story line, minimal special effects, actors or convincing or confident. we know that the great keanu reeves is often risky choices but then there ... it is enough to gawk.
