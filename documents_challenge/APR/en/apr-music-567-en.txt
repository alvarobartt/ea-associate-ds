it is interesting to delve into this first opus solo keith jarrett, even if only to be aware of how far this extraordinary pianist. at the center of this disc, the energy is the force behind the music. his taste for the abstraction is already evident but the rhythmic richness of his game attracted. a very beautiful album which is my favorite part of the discography of jarrett.
