dark album, it contains jewels such as the first track "anywhere out of the world" which sets the stage musical. after a bit more instrumental, we attack the "fleshy" from the album, with three pieces of choice: "in the wake of adversity" - "xavier" - "dawn of the iconoclast." then the beautiful voice of lisa gerrard takes the baton for "cantara" which gives a mystical side to the album. and what about the "summoning of the muse" and ambiance of a cathedral? if you do not know dead can dance, but know a bit era, this album should interest you greatly. and to think that this album has almost 22 years since it was released in ... 1987!
