released in 1994, the division bell does not pick up the bar. worse, it demonstrates conclusively that without waters, pink floyd could not exist. furthermore, we come to wonder if it's for the love of the music of pink floyd or more for the money that this album was recorded. pout, the album is illusion in the first title, very ambient. but after the group held without passion or imagination. everything is called, it knows when the guitar solo is coming. wright is a mere shadow of himself and tries in vain to reproduce the sounds of yesteryear. so an album rather mawkish but i loved his release, maybe because i was born in 1977 and is the only floyd album i have waited (impatiently). now the group does nothing and so much better, as it can stay with the idea of floyd is certainly not that of the last 2 albums that do nothing but dollars. to know the real floyd, see more on the side of atom heart mother (1970), meddle (1971), the dark side of the moon (1973), wish you were here (1975), animals (1977), the wall (1979 ).
