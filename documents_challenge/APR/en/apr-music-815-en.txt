this album was eagerly awaited by all fans of the horsemen especially those who arrived with the black album was released in 1991. but metallica has changed its image (as jason, they cut their hair), his sound and his music. thus the album was highly disappointed, no longer solos, guitar sound is different, the scores are simplified. it became the mighty rock.
