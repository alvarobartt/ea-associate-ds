having once been a "fan" of brandy and seeing the low price for this album i bought this cd bearing in mind that the title "right here" and without knowing if it was a good album. i must confess that i have fingers crossed that there are good titles! i finally was incredibly surprised! i think it is, for me, the best album of brandy. all the pieces are well paced, the sound is really good and i think she sings better than during "the boy is mine". for cons, i'm surprised that her record company (or herself ) has opted out "right here" as a single because i think it's the worst song on the album level and melody. other titles have won out in single and clip, i think especially "warm it up" or "camouflage".
