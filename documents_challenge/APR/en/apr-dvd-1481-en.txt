showgirls wants a remake of eve, the frame is identical but verhoeven uses it to blow up the american myth. the film is deliberately tasteless, outrageous, provocative, in line with a major work like "starship troopers". it destroys a lot of irony with the stereotype of the plucky heroine who is doing his talent, and besides, this is surely not a coincidence that elizabeth berkley is illustrated in which s'Ã©atit a series for teens. briefly, the film is powerful and very funny if not take it at face value.
