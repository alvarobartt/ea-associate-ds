this book wastes no time to immerse ourselves in a mad dash or the protagonists are constantly fleeing. it is true that this seems unlikely, and that any action be based on this desperate flight, we tired a bit at times, but the only drawback. the characters make us laugh and their meeting is explosive to say the least! as for the dog, it's perfect! i took a lot of fun to read and reread this book and i laughed a lot, while enjoying the outstanding permanent. would recommend to those who love love breathless!
