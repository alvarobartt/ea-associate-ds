this book presents a broad overview of the work of poincare (topology, analysis, dynamical systems, probability, philosophy etc.) many of which are still incredibly modern and puts them in perspective with more recent findings. this reading really enjoyable and rewarding. it should be noted that some chapters may require a degree level (or control) to be fully appreciated (and do not forget that a mathematical text reads several times, it's normal not understand the technical aspects at once), but others are more easily accessible. in any case, a reading that can only advise students in mathematics who wish to extend their culture.
