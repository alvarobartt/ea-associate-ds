addressing the visual of a literary masterpiece as "le grand meaulnes" was a daring bet. the feeling that the film leaves is that of disappointment. at no time did find the magic that the book was left to our memories. yet the writing is subtle cosmo, photography is elegant, the acting is okay. music by philippe sarde, yet one of the best composers of film music (train, cat), fails to raise the great breath that prevailed in the wonderful novel by alain fournier. the sets are disappointing. the film gets stuck with the limits of boredom and television series.'s passion and mystery that enliven the book and keep the reader in suspense are absent from the film. fournier's work is so written, dreamlike, removable hard literary genre, his film adaptation can only be reductive. here's a film that you can easily forget.
