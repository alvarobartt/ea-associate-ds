it's because i loved the book by emile bravo and read the enthusiastic comments written on this page that i ordered this book. firstly i am surprised that the authors have included the exact time chosen by emile b. for the journal of huron, and place, brussels, of course. but, either, why not. admittedly, the drawings are talented and it's fun to have integrated other characters and other epic moments in comics, but the charm ends there for me. the diary of a naive we offer boards of great poetry, a sepia us back in time. here we find our heroes fighting against the evil nazis, but at the same time, is not a way to trivialize history? the diary of an innocent had a very subtle in its evocation of the events here, the least we can say is that it's as subtle as a herd of elephants (or nazis) in brussels.
