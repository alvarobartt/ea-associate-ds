nullissime. do not even deserve a star. finally, probably in all cases for all those who were on moby as a writer and songwriter (the brilliant "play" to "hotel"), except of course his special talent to move on the dance electronica. "last night" only serves the soup there (with ruminated ten times less sessions "play" mornings phrasing stuck to massive attack), for the rest, forget it. we expect the next night hoping that it is a mistake for moby journey-it-happens, and for us a bad dream.
