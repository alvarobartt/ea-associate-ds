already the first album was enough but then no one is the bottom line: this album is null and worst of all. here is a band who can play or compose a melody worthy of the name. i do not understand how paul weller itself can be knighted. no piece is detached from the infamous boiled particularly poorly sung and say that this group claims to be his major heirs of the working colasse past. it is light years away. 0 parts may be the pen of singer and boiled, this group has really nothing for him except a hype that will also let them down very soon given the level reached.
