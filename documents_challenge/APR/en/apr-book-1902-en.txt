offered by a friend who seriously asked me my opinion, i failed to strangle me to laugh at breakfast reading that many periodic announced as the equivalent of the da vinci code (badly written as d ' elsewhere but keeps his readers ...) everything is! archaeologist orphan, the diplomat attractive ... no! we are not in the harlequin series but rather a best seller in the media! nonexistent plot, dialogue written in elementary school and historical accuracy from wikipedia, the worse is that many media have praised the void which the author certainly takes advantage of the celebrity family to successfully publish an academic exercise has depth of a puddle! it is even presented as a writer! save your money and your time, even novices should get bored! the icing on the cake for the tone of the novel: the underground temple doors open when pronouncing spells ... is the circle of ali baba! another gem of dialogue: "they are aware of all the mysteries and many more!" incredible revelation tv trays ... one wonders how one can publish it and reject other writers, how can an award to that and not others ... ultimate comfort, everybody has a chance ! or a father may be well placed!
