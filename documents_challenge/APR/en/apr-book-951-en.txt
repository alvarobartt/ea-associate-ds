a wonderful book, a true revelation. it accurately describes a class of men who are unhappy those who imagine that to be loved, they must be nice. but obviously it's a false kindness: kindness imprint of frustration, dismay, despair. a false kindness which we have not the life they really want. a book written by men for men. unlike other books on psychology, the book alternates between theory and practical exercises. you will learn to please you, to tell you, to become strong, to face his fears, to reconnect with your masculinity to finally have a fulfilling sex life and live the life you always dreamed of. there is no promises. at each surveying its own way. a site is also specially dedicated to this book, with a forum to struggle daily to become a little less chic. find us on the site tropgentiltropcon.free.fr
