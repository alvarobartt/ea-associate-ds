blood diamond has the merit of dealing with serious subjects rarely exposed and which our western societies and so-called friendly humans have a large share of responsibility. the story of an hour "blood on the stone" is here a very good story on the topic for understanding the sometimes complex mechanisms that link the trafficking of diamonds large number of atrocities. that said, the film "blood diamond" is nothing other than action film of average bill based on this tragedy. the depth of character and consistency of the scenario (the coincidences are legion) is equivalent to that of james bond. but again, it's a good sign to me that it turns an action movie about this subject, it proves that the west is interested just in africa.
