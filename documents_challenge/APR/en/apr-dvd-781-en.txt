i reiterate my rage to see this box out while the 5th part is not available alone. for personen like me who bought the box 1-2-3 and 4 then, what can you do ????? i would love to meet the editor to tell him that his pseudo-business methods will not work with fans who already have the first 4 (and i do not speak for me) and it mainly contributes to the desire to obtain pirated copies for those who have no scruples and not enough money to repay a 5 dvd box set when they have the top 4!
