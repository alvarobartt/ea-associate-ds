it is the story of a young woman and neurotic hypochondriac who observes his neighbors. from little voyeurism of a building often uninteresting, societal observations occupants quite dusty, this little world has a very brief overview if not quaint. windows on court? a psychological thriller? leave it to the master of suspense, please! here, nothing very mysterious that we suspend the reading, a starry void, then suddenly a preposterous story, which we do not believe the plot came as a hair on the soup, probably to boost the drive that s 'bores him to death, and falls like a bellows. in short, a portrait gallery as insipid as writing. yes, writing a little green, a riddle badly constructed, should give a second chance to this young writer, it is hand to concoct a more mature second novel? bof, bof ... i'll stop there.
