the second opus from the clash after the first very punk, is already an opening towards a more varied music, in its own (perfect setting) and the very rich musical thrust (sax, piano), announcing london calling. i never heard an album like this: it's punk, the riffs and chorus heavy revolt (the beautiful "safe european home," "tommy gun"), while the total antithesis of punk: the sound is dirtier, the music is melodious (note, it has been terrible on the album "the clash" 1977), and drums generous topper headon (on top of his talent) give the music of a singular appearance, military and emotional, violent and monumental. strummer and jones mix ska ( "julie's been working"), punk animal ( "drug stabbing time"), sentimental pop naive ( "stay free") and punk politics ( "fran√ßais civil war", "last gang in town") in delirium powerful symphonic rock completely unbelievable. it feels rough notes of the call from london to approach. bravo!
