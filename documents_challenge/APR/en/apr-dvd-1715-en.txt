i quickly realized that this was not the comedy i expected ... jokes more than muddy, caricatures, ells were able however to tear one or two smiles. for cons the people with whom i watched the parties to end the first half hour! ok for the size and ironic criticism of the monarchy, however this is done in a way that more "heavy", with one end completely ... unlikely to see out of curiosity, because you're good and bad films or lice get a personal idea, but would expect much.
