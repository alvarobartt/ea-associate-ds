beautifully directed by scott derrickson for immediate use in video, "hellraiser: inferno" is surprising because it evokes more of a psychological nightmare that a movie gore, put a stop to the radical starification of pinhead (no more than three minutes of screen presence at the very end of the film) and directs the series in a completely different direction from other chapters. to get an idea, saying that "hellraiser" somehow a tasty mix of "seven" by david fincher and especially "angel heart" by alan parker. on paper this is obviously not very original but the screen is quite effective and very successful.
