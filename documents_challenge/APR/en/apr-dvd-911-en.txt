the copy is not bad, even if the image does nothing exceptional, and the disc even offers the alternative ending. okay, now for the two stars. now the film is cut (the reference version of anchor bay, bruce campbell vs the army of darknes, is 96 minutes) and there is no bonus worthy of the name if the alternative ending. the sound that has been reworked somewhat, which will not interfere with the nostalgic. in summary, aod has not had great success in film and reflects from evil dead i and ii, but this remains an excellent film. too bad this version is mutilated, but it is the only copy of zone 2 available (there is also a disc reg all but image quality is disastrous).
