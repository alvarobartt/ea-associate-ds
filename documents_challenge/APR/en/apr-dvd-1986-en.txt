the disappointment is up to the expectations placed in the movie: great! lucas, who is not yet in need is a 100% commercial film and without any depth. the film is aimed at children: the george not stupid kids are accompanied by dad and hop 2 spectator tickets sold! in addition it is the kids who buy toys and other merchandising. the special effects are superb no problem but as bacri say what makes a movie is above all the screenplay. the scenario is like the phantom menace! history moves in a sudden without any real link between the impressive action scenes. ufo ja-ja is worthy of disney and other characters are unavailable, and bland food. darth maul are talking about! apart from its look fabulous: nothing. it aligns may be ten words before being killed. who is he, where is it? where is the suspense? where are the surprises and revelations? where is harrison ford and his humor? where are the comic situations and ambiguous between luke, han and leia? lucas has sacrificed a myth to the sirens of the big business it is to cry.
