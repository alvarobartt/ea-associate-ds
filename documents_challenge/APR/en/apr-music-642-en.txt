if we can legitimately be restricted on the turn taken by the career of renaud (now tired and tiring ...:)) since the "return of hell" in the 2000s (or even his 90s) there are cons with every reason to rejoice (more for texts, committed and / or humorous, as for music, however) that "compiles" which includes most of its flagship titles. hear the words of "hexagon", it has unfortunately not taken a ride over thirty years later nothing has changed (or only worse)! if we add the album, which still contains the hits "miss maggie" and "mistral winner", was actually there (in my opinion) the best time of renaud. singer sincere for which i continue to feel sympathy, if only for its commitments, including one against this disgrace what the bullfight.
