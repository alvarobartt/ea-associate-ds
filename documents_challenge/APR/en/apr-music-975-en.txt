i recently discovered this band, this album is beautiful compositions inspired melodies envoutantes alone listening to songs like "love you to death," "be my druidess" (which makes me think of the level of voice opposition, a group of obscure 80s), "my girlfriend's girlfriend" and so on. there was also a very successful recovery of "cinnamon girl" by neil young. clearly throughout the album it feels a group that has the pleasure to play and delight the listener. i recommend it to everyone gothic music fan or not.
