this cartoon, albeit a very beautiful and interesting for adults, has a tremendous impact on very young children: my 20 month old son is absolutely fascinated. within seconds he was quiet, listening, watching closely. just then i pronounce the word "kirikou" for his eyes widen and he waits, the transition to post a review of n-th time about the little man. essential for young parents!
