celine dion album opens with the beautiful successful slow "the reason" which proves once again that the diva has vocal cords in perfect condition! would follow a lot of good songs like "treat her like a lady" or the magnificent "tell him" with the talented performer barbra streisand. despite vocal qualities more than obvious, celine dion slight lack of depth on this cd and emotion seem rather "prefabricated." in addition, the singer is neither author nor composer, or even producing her albums ... in short, she's taking it easy, using all senses of the body that nature gave him. she dares to sing in the lovely spanish "haciendo el amor amor", although his spanish accent is quite appalling ... some big names have come together to offer celine on a silver platter, beautiful songs that make up this album. it merely push chansonette still in power, always accurately, always in style, but very rarely in sensitivity. it looks like a computer that is formatted to sing us his sauce hoping that swallows ... in short a good album, well written and full of tubes, but seriously lacking in soul ...
