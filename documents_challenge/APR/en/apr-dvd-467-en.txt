a head-work of sean penn. even if you disagree with certain aspects of the story (the film shows chris mccandless as a hero, what it is to be discussed, and the film gives us quite a bit of criticism hidden) beauty and vision of this film is obvious, and emile hirsch is in impec role of the protagonist. warning: this film version is the original version without subtitles french!
