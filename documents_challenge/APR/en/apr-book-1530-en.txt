five psychotic, a psychopath, a pathological liar, four neuropathic two asperger syndrome, two paranoid, two depressed, two and two schizophrenic manic-depressive. mr kent has returned from a mission psychiatrist. the gallery of portraits that depicts throne on bedroom walls of teenagers, who revered in the world. incidentally, these characters and their business men sweep the big jackpot in the pockets of generations of alienated teenagers (which i was a god and thank you, i am no longer young, alienated just yet). to do what? castles, top models, cakes and cream. the findings are depressing. is it real? probably. the vision of mr. kent is probably not neutral. it must be hard to continue to be a rock'n'roll journalist, after all these years.
