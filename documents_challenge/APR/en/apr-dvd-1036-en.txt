not what's best in japanese animation, but is intended for young viewers. the scenario does not shine but the characters are endearing and has a few scenes Ã©mouvantes.ceux who like pokemon will not be disappointed while others must go their way. the implementation is correct but the bonus of this version are pitiful. no original version of the audio commentary ... it is always better than the tv series that i would not recommend!
