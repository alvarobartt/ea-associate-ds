i am outraged. this film is distressing for at least 3 reasons: 1 - the scenario is hollow, it is no surprise, the hero in the end it comes out too easily, and there is no suspense . so, all is ludicrous. 2 - but there is much more serious: the film is an affront to eastern europe, including slovakia. the germans are presented as monsters of cruelty, while the slovaks are presented as a frightening people (even their appearance is frightening). in the film, all slovak dip in a terrible market of torture, police included! and even children are criminals ... 3 - some passages are limited homophobic: the main characters use "gay" "fag" as insults, + the perverse sadistic german is gay. all this contrasts with the "fine american heroes" presented as naturally more attractive due to their nationality! in short, while the film carries a message is this: "the eastern europe is underdeveloped, mafia and crime is rampant. the dutch and germans are also very negative, and americans are not welcome in europe. the americans, they are beautiful, nice and heterosexual. "the united states would they be doing propaganda crushing europe to climb d ' advantage?
