although i have not tried to implement the recipes in this book, i can tell you it is wonderful! it gives you all the tricks to learn to work the almond paste, sugar and chocolate in pastry decorations. it is very well done, and is decorated with beautiful pictures. all maneuvers performed are explained step by step. i am not a professional pastry chef, but i find this book easily accessible.
