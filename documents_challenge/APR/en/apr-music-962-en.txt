good album from the first listening, tired after a month (by dint of listening to 3 or 4 times a day on the road during the work; op) ... no line on the horizon is reborn from its ash after the concert in nice: i me again and again and again (it's not my style, but there pfff! what memories!). some say they are u2 fatigue (expect to see at their age with their past on stage ... and more!), i say they are tired of hearing u2, and expect that after the compile / concerts with the old songs, themselves nostalgic for that time (u2 it is not that old titles). no, really, it moves, it's rhythmic, it's cool just enough and is not heated above! brief a must listen to my taste very good with her (just enough yet) as the concert. gentlemen "hat" and please "yet"!
