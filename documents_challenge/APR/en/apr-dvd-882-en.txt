again benigni touches the sublime, pouring torrents of poetry and come to make us laugh and cry! the pierrot lunaire composed an ode to love crazy backdrop of war in iraq. it is true that the beginning may be a bit long, the film does not really take off until the poet's departure for baghdad, but after we can only be touched by this magician of the 7th art! it is clear from this film invigorated, it's beautiful like lubitsch or capra! ps. if you get the chance, see the first film benigni's hilarious as the "little devil" or "monster" to my knowledge not available on dvd french, gentlemen distributors what are you waiting!?)
