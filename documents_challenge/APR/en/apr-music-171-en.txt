rihanna is a sublime young woman born in barbados and place musically in the continuity of c aguilera, shakira, b spears, beyon, j lopez, nelly furtado, madonna and a keys and mariah carey to go a little further, or j timberlake and timbaland among garcons.c is to say the same music, mixing hip hop, electro, rnb, rap, repeated to infinity, without instruments, without music, cold, no soul but with the marketing behind and then a great commercial success. the standard imposed by record companies and relayed by the media works to the public in proper condition, then why change? nowadays, anyone can become a star, no need to have talent, just a good marketing plan, look carefully studied, a fine physique, a major behind and you're done, some will be more scandals. only hope that the record industry (what a nasty expression, as if art could be put on the same footing as yoghurt or laundry) realizes one day that can still rhyming quality and sales figures (it's possible to see the success of amy winehouse, black desir, nirvana, louise attack to name a few). conclusion: cd quite ordinary, commonplace, has avoided, i suggest you rather the latest sharon jones of true rhythm and blues
