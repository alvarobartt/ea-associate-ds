I have just finished watching Season 2 and this time I will try to follow the 3rd one on tv...as I am not sure I can wait for the 3rd season to come out on dvd...
 The second season is even more acid than the 1st and full of the usual intricate secrets and blackmails and feminine humour and gossips.
 I think Marc Cherry understands the feminine world very well.  I think we all know at least one person or even ourselves could be a Hysteria Lane character from time to time.
 Great set of dvds...24 episodes + bonus material TOTALY WORTH IT
