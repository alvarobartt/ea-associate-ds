It is the 1924 Paris Olympics. Who will represent Great Briton? The decision will not only be based on athletic abilities but on social standing and religion. Everyone has his or her agenda from the promoters to the runners themselves. In the end compromises must be made but for the final chosen there can be no compromise to win. 
 This is a movie that holds your attention on several levels. Many of the actors are easily recognizable but they do not overshadow the characters they represent. The scenery is switched from Scotland countryside, to Cambridge, and to France (actually shot in England). Of course as depicted in the cover picture the most notable is the run along the beach (West Sands Beach, St Andrews, Scotland, UK.) Then the music, most noticeable in the beach scenes but permeated the movie will stay with you for years (Original music by Vangelis.) The story is based on true events with scriptwriter Colin Welland bringing what would just be facts to life making you feel that you are back in the time and taking part in race.
