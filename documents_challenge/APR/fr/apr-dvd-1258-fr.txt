Fantastic DVD with many wonderful extras. Beautiful, sharp, wide screen transfer but unfortunately, there is no English audio track -only French and Italian - also there are no English subtitles. Still, it's a great movie and a great DVD. I just wish I knew what they were talking about, but these films are so 'visual' that it dosen't really matter. Put in your own dialogue.
