This is a must have for each and everyone who loves comedies with a deeper sense of humor. The story is as small as it should be to be written on the back of a stamp : Three guys go to prison and have to share the same cell, they don't like each other, but they have to escape together. The film works without many words. The characters  are so obvious that they don't need much of a dialogue to be funny. This is a trio never seen before : Roberto Benigni at his best, John Lurie as   the silent man, and Tom Waits mythologizing himself as always. ... and not to forget the thrilling music of Tom Waits, which turns the opening of the film to mere art. Definitively the best Jarmush film and a cult of the eighties. have fun !
