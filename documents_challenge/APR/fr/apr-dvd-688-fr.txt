I am a big fan from Germany and I was very happy to read there will be a Blu-ray Version of that sensational concert. I was so disappointed when I received the Blu-ray! The quality equals exactly the DVD Version. It doesn't look like a HD version at all! Just compare the Blu-rays from CÃ©line Dion in Vegas or Justin Timberlake. They are exeptional!
