In his 1000 or so unparagraphed pages, Littell draws a picture, which defies credibility, of a fictional SS-man who is personified evil. The caricature is so gross that it exonerates the average unexceptional SS-man, making him seem less bad by comparison. I assume this was not Littell's intent. Fortunately and whatever its 'readers' may say, the book is unreadable.
