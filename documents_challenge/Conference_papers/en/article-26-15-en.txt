An object model for categories The structural elements of linguistic formalisms straightforwardly map to configuration problems. A feature corresponds to a CSP variable. Feature structure is a feature aggregate well modeled using classes in an object model. A category naturally maps to a class in an object model, inserted in a class hierarchy involving inheritance (possibly multiple [14]). Many features have (sets of) feature structures as their values. This situation can be adequately modeled using relations in an object model.
