We propose to extend recall and precision by taking into account a cover relation between the elements of the two sets, the summary and the summarized. In this article we use the cover relation defined over references since both queries and logs can be seen as sets of references, and thus the quality measure can be used on queries or on logs, or on any sets of references. Note that the definition of the measure is even more general in the sense that it does not rely on a particular cover relation. We now formalize these notions.
