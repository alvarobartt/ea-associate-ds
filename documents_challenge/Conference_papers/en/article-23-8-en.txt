In order to consolidate the lexical network, we adopt a strategy based on a simple (if not simplistic) inference mechanism to propose new relations from those existing. The approach is strictly endogenous as it doesnâ€™t rely on any other external resources. Inferred relations are submitted either to contributors for voting or to expert for direct validation/invalidation. A large percentage of the inferred relations has been found to be correct. However, a non negligible part of them are found to bewrong and understanding why is both relevant and useful. The explanation process can be viewed as reconciliation between the inference engine and the validator who is guided through a dialog to explain why he found the considered relation incorrect. The possible causes for a wrong inferred relation may comes from three possible origins : false premises that were used by the inference engine, exception or confusion due to some polysemy.
