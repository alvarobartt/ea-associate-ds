The automatic process of documents annotation which we present is carried out in four stages (see Figure 1): 1. Preprocessing: it consists, on the one hand, in the text segmentation and, on the other hand, in the identification of entities. 2. Events annotation: it uses a classifier playing the role of a filter for the non-event sentences. 3. Clustering: it consists in gathering the sentences referring to the same or similar events. We propose in this stage a new similarity measurement between the events. 4. Document annotation: it takes various forms such as: sentences, form, concept, according to the field of application of our approach.
