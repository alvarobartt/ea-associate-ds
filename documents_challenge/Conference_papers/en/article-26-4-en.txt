Such a program is well described using an object model (as illustrated by the figures 3 and 6), together with well formedness rules. Technically solving the associated enumeration problem can be made using various formalisms or technical approaches : extensions of the CSP paradigm [12, 7], knowledge based approaches [17], terminological logics [13], logic programming (using forward or backward chaining, and non standard semantics)[16], object-oriented approaches [11, 17]. Our experimentations were conducted using the object-oriented configurator Ilog Jconfigurator [11].
