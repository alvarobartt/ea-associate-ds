Synonymy This is the semantic relation that holds between two lexical units that could, in a given context, express the same meaning. For example, ,airplaneand ,aeroplane- are synonyms. Contrary to lexical units, acceptions are monosemic by definition. In this context, we can define synonymy as the semantic relation that holds between two acceptions that express the same meaning.
