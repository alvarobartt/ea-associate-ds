Introduction Wikipedia keeps growing to be the world's largest and busiest free encyclopedia, in which articles are collaboratively written and maintained by volunteers online. The huge amounts of quality data in this encyclopedia have motivated many works on automatic acquisition of resources, e.g. acquisition of lexical-semantic knowledge (Zesch, Muller, and Gurevych, 2008).
