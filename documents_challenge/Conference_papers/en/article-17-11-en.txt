Angular Distance Let us define Sim(A;B) as one of the similarity measures between two vectors A et B, often used in information retrieval [Morin, 1999]. We can express this function as: Sim(A;B) = cos(dA;B) = AB with as the scalar product. We suppose here that vector components are positive or null. Then, we define an angular distance DA between two vectors A and B as DA(A;B) = arccos(Sim(A;B)). Intuitively, this function constitutes an evaluation of the thematic proximity and measures the angle between the two vectors.
