The rhetorical diagrams describing the structural organization of a text, whatever the hierarchical level of this latter, make it possible to bind a nucleus and a satellite, two or several nuclei together, and a nucleus with several satellites (Marcu, 1999). The various structures of the text are thus defined in terms of compositions of applications of diagrams, and this in an iterative way.
