Events Annotation An event is a specific object which occurs at one specific moment and in a well defined place [22]. Our objective is to identify all events in a document. We mark each detected event by a tag. Accordingly, a model of classification is built automatically from the training set which permits to predict whether a sentence contains an event or not. We initially used the attributes which refer to the events as they are defined by Naughton [23]. These attributes are the following: • Length of the sentence. • Numbers of capital letters. • Numbers of stop words. • Number of city/town. • Number of numerical marks.
