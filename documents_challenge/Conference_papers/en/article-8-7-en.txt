These invariants can be checked by induction on rules. Hence, such an item asserts there exists a function J from the nodes of a subset of the PTDs of an IG to a syntactic tree with its root labelled by S and phonological projection w1 : : :wj . This function has the same properties as the function I for models but conditions 2 to 5 only apply if both nodes are in the domain of J. The parsing process extends the domain until (1) all the nodes of each PTD selected are used and (2) the input string has been read completely. Then J defines a syntactic tree which is a parse tree.
