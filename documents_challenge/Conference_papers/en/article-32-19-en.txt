For Booking, we obtain an F-measure of 64.8%, i.e. more than 10% above the simple classifier baseline. For the third test, the results do not show improvement over baselines. This is probably caused by the influence of the ontology, which better fits the support vectors to the training corpus (Verbmobil), making them less relevant to the test corpus. When we disable the two ontology-based features, we obtain a precision of 50.2%, a recall of 62.9% and an F-measure of 55.8%, hence, an improvement over the baselines.
