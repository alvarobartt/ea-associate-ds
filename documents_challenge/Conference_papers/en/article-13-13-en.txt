Using syntactic lexicons Obviously, some lexicons already exist which provide interesting lists of prepositions. This is the case of Lefff (Sagot et al., 2006), which contains a long list of prepositions. However, the syntactic part of the lexicon is still under development and it provides only few prepositions in verb subcategorization frames. Besides, some prepositions in Lefff are obsolete or rare.
