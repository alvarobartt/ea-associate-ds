Let be C a finite set of n concepts, a conceptual vector V is a linear combinaison of elements ci of C. For a meaning A, a vector V (A) is the description (in extension) of activations of all concepts of C. For example, the difierent meanings of ,door- could be projected on the following concepts (the CONCEPT[intensity] are ordered by decreasing values): V(,door-) = (OPENING[0.8], BARRIER[0.7], LIMIT[0.65], PROXIMITY [0.6], EXTERIOR[0.4], INTERIOR[0.39], . . .
