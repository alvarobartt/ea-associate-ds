If there is no relation between two words in the network, the similarity is equal to zero. This measure has the advantage of being simple and efficient from an algorithmic viewpoint but some semantic relations are difficult to catch only from cooccurrences in texts. For instance, we experimentally noticed that there are few synonyms of a word among its cooccurrents1. Hence, we can expect that some senses that are discriminated by the algorithm actually refer to one sense.
