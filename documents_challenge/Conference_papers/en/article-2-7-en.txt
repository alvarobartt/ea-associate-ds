Results and Discussion All experiments have been performed on a system equipped with a 3GHz CPU and 16GB of main memory. The methods are implemented by extending a Java implementation of PrefixSpan-based algorithm described in [5]. Figure 4-A shows the scalability of our approach as the runtime increases almost linearly with the database size evolving from 12400 tuples to 99834 (i.e., the whole dataset).
