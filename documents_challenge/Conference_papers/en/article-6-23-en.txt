The 4-cluster and the 9-cluster partitions obtained with this clustering al- gorithm were compared with the INRIA research team categorization 5-class partition known a priori. The 5-class a priori categorization is as follows: “Applied Mathematics, Computation and Simulation (M)”, “Algorithmics, Programming, Software and Architecture (A)”, “Networks, Systems and Ser- vices, Distributed Computing (N) ”, “Perception, Cognition, Interaction (P)” and “Computational Sciences for Biology, Medicine and the Environment (C)”.
