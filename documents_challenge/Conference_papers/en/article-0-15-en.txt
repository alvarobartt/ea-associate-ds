In our context, these measures should be extended to take into account the cover relation used by the operators. For instance, in Example 5, the expression lca(q1[B q2) summarizes q1 and q2 by hfSodag;fS2-08g;fFrancegi, which specifies the query q = fSodagfS2-08g fFranceg. Looking at the references of q1;q2 and q, it can be seen that q is obtained by removing references fCoke;PepsigfJuly08g fParis;Marseille;North;Southg and adding the reference fSodagfS2-08gfFranceg. If we apply the classical precision and recall measures to evaluate its quality, both are null. However, we can consider this summary as a good summary with a good quality since the added reference covers the removed references. Its recall would then be 1 and its precision would depend on the number of references covered by the added reference and not in the removed references.
