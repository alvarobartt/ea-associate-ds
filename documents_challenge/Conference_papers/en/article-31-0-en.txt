Abstract In this paper, we focus on automatic summarization of Arabic texts.  We start by presenting an analytical study carried out on a study corpus which  enabled us to deduce, following empirical observations, a set of relations and  rhetorical frames; then we present our proposed method to produce summaries for Arabic texts.  This method is based bases on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) technique (Mann and Al., 1988)  and uses purely linguistic knowledge. The principle of the proposed method is based on three pillars.  The first pillar is the location of the rhetorical relations between the various minimal units of the  text of which one has the status of nucleus - text segment necessary to maintain coherence -  and the other has the status of nucleus or satellite - optional segment.  The second pillar is the representation and the simplification of RST-tree that is  considered most descriptive. The third pillar is the selection of the nucleus sentences  forming the final summary, which hold in account the type of rhetorical relations chosen.
