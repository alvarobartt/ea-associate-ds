This paper is threefold. The first section presents the study corpus and the linguistic analysis which was based on this corpus to determine the rhetorical relations as well as the organization of the linguistic markers. The second section exposes the proposed method in order to present the text in the form of a hierarchical tree of rhetorical relations. The third section presents the process of summary generation. This process is carried out by the selection of the sentences containing the textual units corresponding to the indicative type of summary or the set of rhetorical relations chosen by the user.
