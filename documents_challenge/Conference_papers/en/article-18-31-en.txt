Phenomenon of regrouping of distinct sets A last potential problem is that the vectors of two distinct sets (at the same time for the lexical network and for thematic) of terms can occupy the same area of space. Computation is done by activation and vectors are randomly drawn at initialization, then that can occurs by accident. It is thus necessary to ”separate” the close vectors but corresponding however to very different parts of the lexical network and of thematic.
