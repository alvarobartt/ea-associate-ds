Introduction Semantic resources have proved to be useful in information retrieval and information extraction for applications such as query expansion (Voorhees, 1998), text summarization (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 2002) or question/answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001). But this work has also shown that these resources must be used with caution: they bring on an improvement of results only if word sense disambiguation is performed with a great accuracy. These findings bring one of the first roles of a semantic resource to light: discriminating and characterizing the senses of a set of words. The main semantic resources with a wide coverage that can be exploited by computers are lexico-semantic networks such as WordNet.
