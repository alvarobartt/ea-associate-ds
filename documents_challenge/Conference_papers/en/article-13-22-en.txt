DICOVALENCE, a valence dictionary of French, formerly known as PROTON (van den Eynde and Mertens, 2002), which has been based on the pronominal approach. In version 1.1, this dictionary details the subcategorization frames of more than 3,700 verbs (table 1 gives an example of a DICOVALENCE entry). We extracted the simple and multiword prepositions it contains (i.e. more than 40), as well as their associated semantic classes.
