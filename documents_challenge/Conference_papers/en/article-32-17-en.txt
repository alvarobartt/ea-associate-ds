The same goes for the third test, “CV +CB”. However, this is not a critical issue in principle, since suitable ontologies are available for the touristic domain. In all cases, the third baseline provides quite stable results, consistently better than the first baseline and, in the second and third tests (for which no suitable ontology was used) better than the second baseline as well. Interestingly, the simple classifier yields a better recall for the third test than for the second one. This might point out a data sparsity problem in training on Booking only (the “CB” configuration).
