French is a resource-rich language as attested by the existing morphological dictionaries which include compounds. In this paper, we use two largecoverage general-purpose dictionaries: Dela (Courtois, 1990; Courtois et al., 1997) and Lefff (Sagot, 2010). The Dela was manually developed in the 90â€™s by a team of linguists. We used the distribution freely available in the platform Unitex3 (Paumier, 2011). It is composed of 840,813 lexical entries including 104,350 multiword ones (91,030 multiword nouns). The compounds present in the resources respect the linguistic criteria defined in (Gross, 1986).
