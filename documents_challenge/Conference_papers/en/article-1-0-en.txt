Introduction Among the main data mining tasks, pattern mining has been extensively studied. Association rules [Agrawal et al., 1993] are one of the most popular patterns. In binary data sets, an association rule is an expression of the form p : X ?Y, where X (the body) and Y (the consequent) are subsets of Boolean attributes. Intuitively, the rule p means that “when attributes of X are observed, then attributes of Y are often observed”. The main interest of a rule pattern is its inductive inference power: from now on, if we observe the attributes of X then we will also probably observe attributes of Y.
