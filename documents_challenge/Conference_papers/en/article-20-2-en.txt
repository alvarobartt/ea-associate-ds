DI-LSA The technique proposed independently by Bestgen (2002), DI-LSA, is very similar to the one proposed by Turney and Littman. The main difference is at the level of the benchmarks used to evaluate a word. While SO-LSA uses a few benchmarks selected a priori, DI-LSA is based on lexicons that contain several hundred words rated by judges on the pleasant-unpleasant scale This kind of lexicon was initially developed in the field of content analysis. As early as 1965, Heise proposed to constitute a valence dictionary by asking judges to rate a sample of the most frequent English words on the pleasant-unpleasant scale. Since then, lexicons for various languages have been made up (Hogenraad et al., 1995; Whissell et al., 1986). As an example, Table 2 shows the evaluation scores of several words randomly extracted from the dictionary and used in the present study (Hogenraad, Bestgen & Nysten, 1995). specific whole set of benchmarks is selected from the lexicon. More precisely, the unknown valence of a word corresponds to the average valence of its thirty closer neighbours, neighbourhood being identified on the basis of the cosine in the semantic space extracted by LSA. To evaluate this index, Bestgen (2002) compared the predicted values for words with their actual values according to the dictionary and obtained correlations ranging from 0.56 to 0.70.
