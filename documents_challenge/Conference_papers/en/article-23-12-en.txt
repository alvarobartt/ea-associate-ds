JeuxDeMots: a GWAP for building a lexico-semantic network JeuxDeMots1 is a two playerGWAP, launched in September 2007, that aims to build a large lexico-semantic network [9]. The network is composed of terms (as vertices) and typed relations (as links between vertices). It contains terms and possible refinements in a similar way to the WordNet synset [1]. There are more than 50 types for relations and relation occurrences are weighted. The weight of a relation is interpreted as a strength, but not directly as a probability of being valid neither a confidence level.
