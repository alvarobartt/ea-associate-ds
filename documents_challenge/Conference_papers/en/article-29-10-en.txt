Another potential source of local paraphrases lies in the possibly numerous modi fications that writers make when revising a text, some of them being intended not to alter the meaning of the text but to improve its quality, to make it more coherent, or to limit redundancy. Drafts of famous writers are for example used in textual genetic criticism (e.g. (Bourdaillet and Ganascia, 2007)) which studies the process of text creation.
