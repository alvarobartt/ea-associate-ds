2. building of the shared nearest neighbor graph: this step only consists in replacing, in the sparsified graph, the value of each edge by the number of direct neighbors shared by the two cooccurrents linked by this edge. 3. computation of the distribution of strong links among cooccurrents: as for the first step, this one is a kind of sparsification. Its aim is to help finding the seeds of the senses, i.e. the cooccurrents that are the most representative of a set of cooccurrents. This step is also a means for discarding the cooccurrents that have no relation with the other ones. More precisely, two cooccurrents are considered as strongly linked if the number of the neighbors they share is higher than a fixed threshold. The higher than a fixed threshold. The number of strong links of each cooccurrent is then computed.
