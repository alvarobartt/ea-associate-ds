These experiments show that it could be risky to rely on confidence or growth rate values to make predictions since they do not capture the notion of robustness. The stability of the MODL level is a sign of robustness; in the following experiments, we show that patterns with negative level values are non-significant and the ones with positive level values are patterns of interest.
