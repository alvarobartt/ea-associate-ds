Discourse-level annotation Dialogues are structured by various moves that the participants make e.g., answering questions, asking follow-up questions, elaborating prior claims, and so on. Our work is novel both with respect to the literature on preference extraction and on dialogue. Existing formal models of dialogue content either do not formalize a link between utterances and preferences (e.g., [16]), or they encode such links in a typed feature structure, where desire is represented as a feature that takes conjunctions of values as arguments (e.g., [22]), making the representation too restricted to express dependencies among preferences. What is required, then, is a method for extracting partial information about preferences and the dependencies among them that are expressed in dialogue, perhaps indirectly, and a method for exploiting that partial information to identify the next optimal action.
