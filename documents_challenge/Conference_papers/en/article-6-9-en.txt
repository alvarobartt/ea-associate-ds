These relevance weights change at each algorithm iteration and are different from one cluster to another. However, this method is based on the dynamic hard clustering algorithm for relational data (Lechevallier (1974), De Carvalho et al (2008), De Carvalho et al (2009)) as well as on the dynamic clustering method based on adaptive distances (Diday and Govaert (1977), De Carvalho and Lechevallier(2009)).
