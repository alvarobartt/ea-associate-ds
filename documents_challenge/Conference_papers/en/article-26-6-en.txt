Our leading intuition is that the process of building a parse tree is very similar to a configuration activity (since new constructs are introduced to group words in adequate categories like the verb or noun phrases, AND these constructs are linked by relations). Among the potential benefits are the fact that we may foresee to achieve ultimately exact semantics for languages dealing with relevant knowledge, and also that the most intricate cooperation between the syntax and the semantics can be obtained.
