In this article we present and develop the work initiated in [1, 2]. In these papers, we proposed a framework for summarizing an OLAP query log, and we studied basic properties of the framework for helping the user to query the log. The present article provides a detailed presentation of the framework and introduces its implementation as a system for summarizing and querying log files. To this end, we extend the search facilities introduced in [2] to obtain a declarative language with which complex queries over a log file can be expressed.
