Handling preferences is not easy. First, specifying an ordering over acceptable outcomes is not trivial especially in multi criterial situations. For instance, choosing a new camera to buy may depend on several criteria (e.g. battery life, weight, etc.); hence, ordering even two outcomes (cameras) can be cognitively difficult because of the need to consider trade-offs and dependencies between the criteria. Second, users often lack complete information about preferences initially. They build a partial description of agentsâ€™ preferences that typically changes over time.
