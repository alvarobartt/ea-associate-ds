Traditional Sequential Pattern Sequential patterns were introduced in [2] and can be considered as an extension of the concept of frequent itemset [1] by handling timestamps associated to items. Sequential pattern mining aims to extract sets of items commonly associated over time. In the “basket market” concern, a sequential pattern can be for example: “40 % of the customers buy a television, then buy later on a DVD player”.
