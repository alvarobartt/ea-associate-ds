This includes very common nouns (e.g. thing, way, etc) and verbs (e.g. have, be, come), as well as terms that are over-represented in the Hansard corpus (e.g. house), since alignment errors induce some noise for very frequent items. Finally, we combined the candidate lists produced by the two approaches by filtering candidates for one approach that are not present in the other's candidate list.
