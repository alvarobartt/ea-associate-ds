The IF [4] relies on dialogue acts, concepts, and arguments. Dialogue acts describe speakerâ€™s intention, goal, and need. Concepts define the focus of the dialogue act. Several concepts may appear in one IF. Arguments instantiate discourse variable values. An IF is encoding a Semantic Dialogue Unit (SDU), thus a dialogue turn may have to be described with several IFs. The IF focuses more on the intent rather than the literal meaning of the utterance.
