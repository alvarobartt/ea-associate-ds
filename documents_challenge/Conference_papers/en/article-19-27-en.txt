Related work As they rely on the detection of high-density areas in a network of cooccurrences, (Véronis, 2003) and (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) are the closest methods to ours. Nevertheless, two main differences can be noted with our work. The first one concerns the direct use they make of the network of cooccurrences. In our case, we chose a more general approach by working at the level of a similarity graph: when the similarity of two words is given by their relation of cooccurrence, our situation is comparable to the one of (Véronis, 2003) and (Dorow and Widdows, 2003);
