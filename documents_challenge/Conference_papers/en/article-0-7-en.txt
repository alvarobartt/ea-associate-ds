Assume we want to summarize these queries by another query. Various solutions are possible. First, we can summarize the queries by retaining for each dimension the most frequent members. This could be of interest for a DBA who would like to know what indices to store. In that case, the resulting query would ask for sales of Coke in regions North or South during July 2008 (i.e., query q2). A second alternative would be to summarize the queries with another query having for each dimension the members that cover all members present in the initial queries. For example, note that Pepsi, Coke and Orangina are sodas, cities Paris and Marseille and regions North and South are in France and all three queries concern year 2008. The query summarizing the log L would then ask for the sales of Soda in France in 2008. The user interested in more details on the query could then query the log to find the queries that were indeed launched.
