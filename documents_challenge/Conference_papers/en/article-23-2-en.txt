Introduction Developing lexico-semantic network for NLP in one the the major issue of the field. Most of the existing resources have been constructed by hand, like for instance the famous WordNet. Of course some tools are generally designed for consistency checking, but nevertheless the task remains time consuming and costly. Fully automated approaches are generally limited to term coocurrences as extracting precise semantic relations between terms fromtext is really difficult. New approaches involving crowdsourcing are flowering in NLP especially with the advent of Amazon Mechanical Turk or in a broader scope Wikipedia and Wiktionnary, to cite the most well known examples.
