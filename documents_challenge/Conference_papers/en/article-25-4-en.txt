This paper proposes to include some semantic information early in the statistical Language Model (LM) for ASR. This work is realized in the framework of a global speech-tospeech translation project called NESPOLE1 [3]. Within this project, an Interchange Format (IF) based approach, representing the meaning of phrases independently of languages, was adopted for the actual translation.
