Frigui et al (2007) proposed CARD, a clustering algorithm that is able to partition objects taking into account multiple dissimilaritity matrices and that learns a relevance weight for each dissimilarity matrix in each cluster. CARD is mainly based on the well know fuzzy clustering algorithms for relational data RFCM (Hathaway et al (1989)) and FANNY (Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990)).
