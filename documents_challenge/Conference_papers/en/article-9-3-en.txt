Nevertheless, unification grammars cannot directly take into account the fact that some linguistic units are unsaturated in a sense that they must absolutely combine with other structures to form a stable unit. Saturation is ensured by additional mechanisms, such as the distinction of terminal and non-terminal symbols in rewriting systems or by requiring some features to have an empty list as a value in HPSG.
