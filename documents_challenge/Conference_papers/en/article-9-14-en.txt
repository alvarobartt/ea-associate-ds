Tree grammars The first tree grammars belonging to the paradigm of PUGs was proposed by Nasr 1995. The following grammar G1 allows generating all finite trees (a tree is a connected directed graph such that every node except one is the target of at most one edge); objects are nodes and edges; the initial structure (the box on the left) is reduced to a black node; the grammar has only one other elementary structure, which is composed of a black edge linking a white node to a black node. Each white node must unify with a black node in order to be neutralized and each black node can unify with whatever number of white nodes. It can easily be verified that the structures generated by the grammar are trees, because every node has one and only one governor, except the node introduced by the initial structure, which is the root of the tree.
