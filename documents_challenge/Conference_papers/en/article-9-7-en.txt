Our structures are polarized, that is, objects are associated to polarities. The set P of polarities is provided with an operation noted “.” and called product. The product is commutative and generally associative; (P, . ) is called the system of polarities. A non-empty strict subset N of P contains the neutral polarities. A polarized structure is neutral if all its polarities are neutral.
