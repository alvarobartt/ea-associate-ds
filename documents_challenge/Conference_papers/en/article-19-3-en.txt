Overview The starting point of the method we present in this article is a network of lexical cooccurrences, that is a graph whose vertices are the significant words of a corpus and edges represent the cooccurrences between these words in the corpus. The discovering of word senses is performed word by word and the processing of a word only relies on the subgraph that contains its cooccurrents. The first step of the method consists in building a matrix of similarity between these cooccurrents by exploiting their relations in the subgraph. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is then applied for grouping these cooccurrents and giving rise to the senses of the considered word.
