We decided on the second solution as it improves lexicon maintainability. An issue that is more directly linked to multiword prepositions is that of segmentation ambiguities. For example, in the following two sentences (2a) and (2b) the group of words au cours de is a multiword preposition in the first case, but it has to be decomposed in the second one. Other multiword prepositions can never be decomposed, for example y compris. 2a. Il a beaucoup travaill´e au cours de cette année [He worked hard during the year] 2b. Il a beaucoup travaill´e au cours de M. Durand [He worked hard in Mr Durand’s course]
