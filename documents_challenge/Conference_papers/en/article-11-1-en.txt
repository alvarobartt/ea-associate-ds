In this study we address the problem of automatically identifying the pairs of texts that are translation of each other in a set of documents. We show that it is possible to automatically build particularly efficient content-based methods that make use of very little lexical knowledge. We also evaluate our approach toward a front-end translation task and demonstrate that our parallel text classifier yields better performances than another approach based on a rich lexicon.
