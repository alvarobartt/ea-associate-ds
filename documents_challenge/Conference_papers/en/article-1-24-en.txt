in [Le Bras et al., 2010], the authors suggest a new notion of robustness dependent on an interestingness measure µ and a threshold µmin. Starting from the observation that a rule can be characterized by a R3-vector of three values of its contingency table (e.g. the frequency of the body, the frequency of the target and the number of counterexamples; see figure 2), the authors define the robustness of rule p as the normalized Euclidean distance rob(p,µmin) = ||p -p*||2/v3 between p and a limit rule p* (i.e. a rule minimizing g(p') = ||p' -pmin||2 where pmin is such that µ(pmin) = µmin). In such framework, comparing two rules in terms of robustness does not need any thresholding, however for filtering purpose (e.g., selection of a subset of robust rules) another non-trivial parameter (rob) has to be set (in addition with frequency and the current measure thresholds).
