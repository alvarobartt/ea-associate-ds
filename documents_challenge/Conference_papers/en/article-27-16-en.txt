Contribution of the lexical networks to the conceptual vectors As shown in [18], distances computed on vectors are influenced by shared components and/or disinct components. Angular distance is a good tool for our aims because of its mathematical characteristics, its simplicity to understand and to linguistically interpret and futhermore it is effective for computational process.
