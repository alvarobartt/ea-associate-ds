Then, this degree of resemblance can be seen as a measure of dissimilarity or similarity between the query and the available objects in the database. Does the way that we measure the similarity or the dissimilarity between objects affect the result of a query? It is the same in many other areas when we seek to achieve a grouping of individuals into classes. It is obvious that the outcome of any algorithm, based on proximity measures, depends on the measure used.
