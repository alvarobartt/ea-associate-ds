For each approach we report precision at ranks n=1, ..., 100 in the candidate list, MAP, MRR, the R-precision, the number of considered synonym pairs from the reference (krefk), with respect to which the overall recall is computed. We also report the in uence of different frequency filters. A line with f>5000 means we consider only candidates and reference items with a frequency above 5000 in Wacky.
