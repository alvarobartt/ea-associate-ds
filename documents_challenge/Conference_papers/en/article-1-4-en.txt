Instability of interestingness measures. Even if subsets of extracted rules have shown to be quite effective for predictions, it can be easily shown that highly confident or emerging rules are not individually robust. In figure 1, we compare the confidence (resp. growth rate) train values with the confidence (resp. growth rate) test values of rules extracted from UCI breast-w data set [Asuncion and Newman, 2007].
