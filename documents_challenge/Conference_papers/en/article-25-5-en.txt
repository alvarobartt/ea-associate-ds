The most obvious advantage is the reduction of the number of different systems, which have to be implemented. Given n different languages, an analysis chain (starting from the spoken input and delivering an IF representation) and a synthesis chain (taking the IF representation and providing a linguistic form for it) for each language suffice to yield a system capable of dealing with speech-to-speech translation between all of the possible language pairs.
