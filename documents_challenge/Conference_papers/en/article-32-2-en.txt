We distinguish preferences from opinions. Opinions are defined as a point of view, a belief, a sentiment or a judgment that an agent may have about an object or a person; preferences, as we have defined them, involve an ordering on behalf of an agent and thus are relational and comparative. Opinions concern absolute judgments towards objects or persons (positive, negative or neutral), while preferences concern relative judgments towards actions (preferring them or not over others).
