ABSTRACT. In this article, we present a new method to automatically translate biomedical terms. This method relies on an original machine-learning technique that infers rewriting rules and on the use of language models. Evaluations presented here prove that this method yields good results and allows one to translate between any two languages provided that their differences are regular enough to be learnt. This translation method is applied and evaluated on a interlingual IR task in the biomedical domain with queries in several languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Italian); the good results we obtain prove the interest of such an automatic approach for the information retrieval domain.
