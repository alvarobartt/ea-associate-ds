In our case, the elements to cluster are the cooccurrents in the network of lexical cooccurrences of the word whose senses have to be discriminated. Within the same framework, we tested two measures for evaluating the similarity between the cooccurrents of a word in order to get word senses with different levels of granularity. The first measure corresponds to the cohesion measure between words in the cooccurrence network.
