The maximum number of terms a player can enter is limited, thus encouraging the player to think carefully about his choices. The same termT, along with the same instructions, are later given to another player, Player B, for whom the process is identical. To make the game more fun, the two players score points for words they both choose. Score calculation is explained in [10] and was designed to increase both precision and recall in the construction of the database. Answers given by both players are displayed, those common to both players are highlighted, as are their scores.
