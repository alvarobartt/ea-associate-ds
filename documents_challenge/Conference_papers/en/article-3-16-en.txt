Conclusion The choice of a proximity measure is subjective because it depends often of habits or criteria such as the subsequent interpretation of results. This work proposes a new approach of equivalence between proximity measures. This approach, called topological, is based on the concept of neighborhood graph induced by the proximity measure. For the practical matter, in this paper the measures that we have compared, are built on continuous and binary data.
