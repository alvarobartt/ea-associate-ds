Principle WordNet is a lexical database for English developed under the direction of George Armitage Miller by the Cognitive Science Laboratory of the university of Princeton (New Jersey, USA). It aims to be consistant with the access to the human mental lexicon. WordNet is organized in sets of synonyms called synsets. To each synset corresponds a concept.
