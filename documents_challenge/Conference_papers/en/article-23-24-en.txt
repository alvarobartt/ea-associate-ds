Statistical filtering It is possible to evaluate a confidence level (on an open scale) for each produced inference, such a way that dubious inferences can be filtered out. The weight W of an inferred relation is the geometric mean of the weight of the premises (relations (1) and (2) in Figure 5). If the second premise has a negative value, the weight is not a number and the proposal is discarded. As the geometric mean is less tolerant to small values than the arithmetic mean, inferences not based on two rather certain relations (premises) are unlikely to pass.
