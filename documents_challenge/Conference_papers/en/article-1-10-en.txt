Experimentations In this section, we lead several experiments to show (i) that confidence and growth rate are generally unstable from train to test phase and thus are not good candidates to capture the robustness of classification rules ; (ii) that, conversely, the level is stable in the same experimental conditions and (iii) that the level allows us to naturally identify robust and interesting rules.
