In most of these cases, the “split” sense is scattered over one large cluster and one or several small clusters that only contain 3 or 4 cooccurrents. More precisely, the sense seeds of the small clusters are not associated to the seed of the large cluster while most of the cooccurrents that are linked to them are associated to this seed. Instead of defining a specific mechanism for dealing with these small clusters, we chose to let the SNN algorithm to solve the problem by only deleting these small clusters (size < 6) after the step 5 and marking their cooccurrents as unclassified. The last step of the algorithm aggregates in most of the cases these cooccurrents to the large cluster. Moreover, this new step makes the built senses more stable when the parameters of the algorithm are only slightly modified.
