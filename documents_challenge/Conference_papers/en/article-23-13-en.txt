When Player A begins a game, instructions concerning the type of lexical relation (synonyms, antonym, domain, etc.) are displayed, as well as a term T chosen from the database. Player A has a limited time to enter terms which, to his mind, correspond to termT and the lexical relation. A screenshot of the user interface during a game is shown in Figure 1 and of the outcome of the game in Figure 2.
