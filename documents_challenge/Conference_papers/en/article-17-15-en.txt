If we had to explicit all relations, we may hit the problem of links number explosion. It is a praticial problem (memory size) but it also push forward the question of the link relative relevance: their discriminanting power is inversely proportionnal to their number. For instance, every noun acceptions would be linked to a general term like ,concrete object- by an hyperonymy link. For the acception ,cat-, ,feline- seems a better hyperonym than ,animal- or ,mammal-. To avoid this problem, and to be able to compare two links, we rely on valued semantic relations.
