The emergence and wide adoption of wikis has made collaborative writing a very common practice. The Wikipedia online encyclopedia, in particular, attracts many contributions on a broad range of subjects and in many languages. While some contributions consist in important changes (e.g. creation of an article, removal of a section, complete rewriting of a paragraph), a significant proportion of textual modifications are made on short text spans by human contributors to correct, improve or augment the content of the encyclopedia. The revision history of such resources thus constitutes an important source of naturally-occurring rewriting phenomena, including local paraphrases in context.
