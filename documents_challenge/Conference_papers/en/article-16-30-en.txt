So for instance, the 10 candidates of table 2 evaluated against the WordNet reference would receive a precision of 3/10 and a recall of 3/5, (and not 3/8, because understructure, substructure and fundament are absent from the Hansard). R-precision would also be 3/5, since all correct candidates are found at ranks less than the reference size (5 synonyms). Precision at rank 1 would be 1 while precision at rank 5 would be 3/5. The MAP would be 0.63 = 6.29/10 = (1/1 + 2/2 + 3/3 + 3/4 + . . .+ 3/10) / 10 and MMR would be 1 in this case because the first candidate is correct. It would be 1/2 if only the second were correct, etc.
