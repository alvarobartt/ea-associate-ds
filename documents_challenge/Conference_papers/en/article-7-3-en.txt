SyDoM is a semantic annotation system of Web pages. It allows the enrichment of these pages in order to find them without taking account of their writing language. But, we notice that SyDoM can carry out research only on Web pages that it has already been annotated, yet it is unable to interrogate Web pages when the annotations were created using different semantic thesauri.
