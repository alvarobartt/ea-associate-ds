Some remarks Some sources include as prepositions forms that are not universally considered to be prepositions in linguistics. This is the case, in particular, for: • comme, which is not present in the three reference sources (Grevisse, TLFi and PrepNet) as it is ambiguous and can also be used as a conjunction, • il y a or y compris, which only appear in Lefff, • d’avec, which only appears in Grevisse and verb subcategorization frames in DICOVALENCE and SynLex. We decided to keep those forms in the lexicon for practical reasons, keeping the parsing application in mind.
