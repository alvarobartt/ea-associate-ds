Conceptual Vectors We represent thematic aspects of textual segments (documents, paragraph, syntagms, etc) by conceptual vectors. Vectors have been used in information retrieval for long [Salton et MacGill, 1983] and for meaning representation by the LSI model [Deerwester et al, 90] from latent semantic analysis (LSA) studies in psycholinguistics. In computational linguistics, [Chauche, 90] proposes a formalism for the projection of the linguistic notion of semantic field in a vectorial space, from which our model is inspired.
