Evaluating the quality of a hierarchical clustering is far more problematic because we have to take the nesting and the height of the clusters into account. To fulfill this task, Blanc et al.[1] introduced a recursively defined measure that generalized the Mancoridis criteria[11] to hierarchical clusterings. The same idea is used here for all measures respecting the additivity constraint[13].
