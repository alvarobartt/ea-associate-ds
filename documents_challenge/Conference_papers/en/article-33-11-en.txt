POS n-grams. We use part-of-speech unigrams and bigrams in order to capture MWEs with irregular syntactic structures that might indicate the idiomacity of a word sequence. For instance, the POS sequence preposition â€“ adverb associated with the compound depuis peu (recently) is very unusual in French. We also integrated mixed bigrams made up of a word and a part-of-speech.
