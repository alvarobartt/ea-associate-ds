LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY CORPUS An automatic summary requires as a preliminary step a linguistic analysis of the corpus. The essential goal of this analysis is to determine the surface linguistic units which represent linguistic markers launching research (research the valid rhetorical relations) as well as their corresponding validation markers. These linguistic markers are independent from a particular field and are organized in rhetorical relations. In order to illustrate the characteristics of our study field, we present the various stages of our study carried out on a corpus of newspaper articles.
