Reference system In order to assess the performance of the different classifiers we trained, we implemented a fair reference system which makes use of a bilingual lexicon (a set of pair of words that are translations of each other). This variant is named dictionary hereafter. We downloaded the Spanish-English dictionary of the pythoËœnol project5, a project devoted to helping English speakers learn Spanish. This dictionary contains more than 70 000 bilingual entries.
