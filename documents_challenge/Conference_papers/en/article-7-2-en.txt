The rest of the document is organized as follows: Section (2) introduces the related work on annotation methods. Then, the particular methods of temporal information annotation are exhibited. In section (3), we present our approach for automatic events annotation. In order to validate our survey, we describe the four steps we followed to carry out the AnnotEv system. The experimentation is described in section (4). In section (5) we evaluate the system in order to demonstrate its proficiency. In section (6) we end our work with a few notes on future work.
