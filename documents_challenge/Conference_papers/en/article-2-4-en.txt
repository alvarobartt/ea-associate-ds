Data Description The experiments were conducted on about 100000 product reviews from amazon.com, in order to study the vocabulary used according to reviews. This dataset is a subset of the one used in [7]. Reviews have been lemmatized1 and grammatically filtered in order to remove uninteresting terms, by using the tree tagger tool [11]. Preserved terms are verbs (apart from modal verbs and the verb “be”), nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
