Accordingly, during the last decade several approaches for automatic ontology construction from text corpus (i.e. reference documents but also general documents) have been proposed [Velardi et al., 2007, Maynard et al., 2009b]. A wide range of techniques has been used to automatically execute the different tasks of ontology construction process. Because most of these approaches have been developed and tested in specific application contexts, sometimes, the employed techniques can be applied only within these contexts and provide interesting outcomes only for specific types of text content.
