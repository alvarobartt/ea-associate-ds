The texts handled by ARSTResume are initially pretreated to prepare their segmentation in titles, sections, paragraphs and sentences. The segmented text will call upon a base of rhetorical frames in order to detect the various nuclei units and satellites of the text, as well as the types of the relations which connect them. Thus we obtain the rhetorical tree. This tree represents the text in hierarchical form. This will be developed and based on a set of rules and rhetorical diagrams. The sentences selected for the final summary depend on the rhetorical relations chosen by the user (or automatically the system uses the indicative summary in case the user makes no choice).
