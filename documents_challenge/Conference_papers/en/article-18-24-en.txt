Exploitation of definitions EXtended WordNet [21] is a project carried out to Southern Methodist University of Dallas (Texas, USA) which has two aims: – to disambiguate terms used in the definitions of the synsets i.e. to indicate which are the synsets employed in the definition; – to transform these definitions into logical form to allow more easy calculations.
