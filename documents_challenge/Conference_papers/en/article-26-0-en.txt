Introduction Recent evolution of linguistic theories heavily rely upon the concept of constraint [14, 2, 3, 5]. According to these formalisms, the validity of a syntactical construct is achieved when feature constraints are satisfied. Two approaches at least make explicit claims of being purely constraint based. The implementation of dependency grammars in [5] exploits a generic CSP framework (within a concurrent constraint programming paradigm) with set variables and selection constraints. The property grammars[2, 3] are presented together with a a specific parsing algorithm.
