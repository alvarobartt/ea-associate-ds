our formalism is trivially monotonic: the combination of two structures A and B by a PUG gives us a structure A?B that contains A and B as substructures. We can add a (partial) order on P in order to make the formalism monotonic.4 Let = be this order. In order to give us a monotonic formalism, = must verify the following monotonicity property: ?x,y?P x.y = x. This provides us with the following order: ¦ < ? < +/– < ¦. A PUG built with an ordered system of polarities (P, . ,=) verifying the monotonicity property is monotonic. Monotonicity implies good computational properties; for instance it allows translating the parsing with PUG into a problem of constraint resolution (Duchier & Thater, 1999).
