In practice, the largest C is, the finer the meaning descriptions are. In return, the computing is less easy. It is clear that, for dense vectors3, the enumeration of activated concepts is long and difficult to evaluate. We would generally prefer to select the thematically closest terms, i.e., the neighbourhood. For instance, the closest terms ordered by increasing distance to ,door- are: V(,door-)=,portal-, ,portiere-, ,opening-, ,gate-, ,barrier-,. . .
