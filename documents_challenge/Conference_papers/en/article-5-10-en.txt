Hierarchy quality optimization The formula 2 and 3 can be used to compare different hierarchical clusterings and select the best one for a given network. Therefore we are able to access the relevance of a modification applied on a hierarchical clustering. We can for example determine whether or not a given node in the clustering tree should be removed. The removal of a node t is the replacement of t by its successors s(t).
