The smaller the measure, the more `antonyms' the two lexical items are. However, it would be a mistake to consider that two synonyms would be at a distance of about 2 . Two lexical items at 2 have not much in common8. We would rather see here the illustration that two antonyms share some ideas, specifically those which are not opposable or those which are opposable with a strong activation. Only specific activated concepts would participate in the opposition. A distance of 2 between two items should rather be interpreted as these two items do not share much idea, a kind of anti-synonymy.
