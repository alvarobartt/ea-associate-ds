As it would not be then reasonable nor easy to define a concept set of the size chosen, It is easier to seek an approach which enables us to avoid it. Moreover, what can seem a makeshift or at least a compromise proves to be an advantage because the lexical density in space of the words calculated by emergence is much more constant than in a space where concepts are predifined. Indeed, the resources (dimensions of space) have tendency to be harmoniously distributed according to the lexical richness.
