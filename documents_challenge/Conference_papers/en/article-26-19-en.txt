We implemented this grammar using the object model listed in figure 3 and its associated model constraints. In this model, the classes S, A, and B correspond to the categories introduced in [3]. The class Cat is an abstraction for all the categories. It provides the attributes begin and end required for the proper statement of linearity constraints. The class TerminalCat is an abstraction for the terminal categories, here A and B.
