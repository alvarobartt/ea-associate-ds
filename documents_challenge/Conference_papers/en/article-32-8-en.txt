For each EDU, annotators identify how outcomes are expressed and then indicate how the preferences on these outcomes are linked using the operators not, &, or and ->?. In the example below, <o> i indicates that o is the outcome number i in the EDU, brackets indicate how outcomes are attached and preference annotation is given after the symbol //.
