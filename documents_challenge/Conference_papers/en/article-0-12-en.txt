Properties of QSL While a precise characterization is part of our future work, we list below the properties of the QSL operators. Some of these properties, like for instance the distributivity of max or the commutativity of max and lca are used in our implementation of the framework. Let q;q1;q2 be query expressions. We have the following: [B;\B;nB keep their classical properties [6]. max and most f req are idempotents: max(max(q)) = max(q) and most f req(most f req(q)) = most f req(q). max is distributive over [B and nB: max(q1 [B q2) = max(max(q1)[B max(q2)) and max(q1 nB q2) = max(q1 nB max(q2)). C is associative: qC(q1Cq2) = (qCq1)Cq2 = q. max and lca commute: max(lca(q)) = lca(max(q)) = lca(q). most f req(lca(q)) = lca(q).
