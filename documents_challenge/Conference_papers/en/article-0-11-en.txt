(Di). For a dimension Di, we consider that members are arranged into a hierarchy <i and we note m <i m0 (or m < m0 or m0 covers m) the fact that the member m0 is the ancestor of m in this hierarchy. Given such a cube, a cell reference (or reference for short) is an n-tuple hm1; :::;mni where mi is a member of dimension Di;8i 2 [1;n]. We define multidimensional queries as sets of references that can be expressed as Cartesian products of multisets. The reason for having multisets is to be able to define operators that count membersâ€™ occurrences. In this work, we distinguish between a query and its expression called query expression. A query expression is a tuple of multisets, one multiset of members in each dimension. The cross-product of these multisets is a multiset of references, which is the query.
