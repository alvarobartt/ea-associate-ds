Cosine Measure The cosine measure (cosine) We followed the approach of Nadeau and Foster [11] and represented a document by a vector whose dimension expresses the number of different tokens in the corpus. One vector is built for each of the following feature families: – Numbers (number): any sequence of digits. – Selected punctuations (punct): parenthesis, square brackets and double quote. – Named entity (name): any capitalized word that is not the first in a sentence.
