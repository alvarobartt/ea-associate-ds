Because of the way they were built, mainly by hand, these networks are not fundamentally different from traditional dictionaries. Hence, it is not very surprising that they were criticized, as in (Harabagiu et al., 1999), for not being suitable for Natural Language Processing. They were criticized both about the nature of the senses they discriminate and the way they characterize them. Their senses are considered as too fine-grained but also incomplete. Moreover, they are generally defined through their relations with synonyms, hyponyms and hyperonyms but not by elements that describe the contexts in which they occur.
