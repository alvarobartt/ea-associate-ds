There are two common representations of the objects upon which clus- tering can be based : (usual or symbolic) feature data and relational data. When each object is described by a vector of quantitative or qualitative val- ues the set of vectors describing the objects is called a feature data. When each (complex) object is described by a vector of sets of categories, intervals or weight histograms, the set of vectors describing the objects is called a sym- bolic feature data. Symbolic data has been mainly studied in Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) (Bock and Diday (2000)).
