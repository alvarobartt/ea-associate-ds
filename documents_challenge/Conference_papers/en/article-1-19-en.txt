µ measures the difference between the conditional entropies of the null rule model (default rule) and a given rule p. The higher µ, the more interesting p is. µ may be seen as the number of bits saved when compressing the data using p instead of using p/0. In figures 7 and 8, we highlight the rules with a positive MODL level (red ’o’). As expected, rules with a positive level are generally the most interesting, i.e. with higher µ values. Consequently, rules with a negative level (blue ’+’) value are located in the southwest of the graphs, with low µ values.
