Inference and Reconciliation for an Elicitation Engine We designed a system for augmenting the number of relations in the JDM lexical network having two main components: (a) an inference engine and (b) a reconciliator. The inference engine proposes relations as if it were a contributor, to be validated by other human contributors or experts. In case of invalidation of an inferred relation, the reconciliator is invoked to try to assess why the inferred relation was found wrong. Elicitation here should be understood as the process to make some implicit knowledge of the user into explicit relations in the lexical network.
