Research teams are grouped into scientific themes that do not correspond to an organizational structure (such as departments or divisions), but act as a virtual structure for the purpose of presentation, communication and evaluation. Choice of themes and team allocation are mostly related to strategic objectives and scientific closeness between existing teams, but also take in account some geographical constraints, such as the desire for a theme to be representative of most Inria centers.
