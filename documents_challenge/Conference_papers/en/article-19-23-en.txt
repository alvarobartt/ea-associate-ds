For each considered word, the evaluation method tries to map one of its discovered senses with one of its synsets in WordNet by applying a specific similarity measure. Hence, only the precision of the word sense discovering algorithm is evaluated but Pantel and Lin indicate that recall is not very significant in this context: a discovered sense may be correct and not present in WordNet and conversely, some senses in WordNet are very close and should be joined for most of the applications using WordNet. They define a recall measure but only for ranking the results of a set of systems. Hence, it cannot be applied in our case.
