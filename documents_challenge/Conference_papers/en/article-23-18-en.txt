Diko: a Contributive Tool for the JDM Network Diko is a web based tool for displaying the information contained in the JDM lexical network but also can be used as a contributive tool(3. The necessity to not rely only on the JeuxDeMots game for building the lexical network comes from the fact that many relation types of JDM are either difficult to grasp for a casual player or not very productive (not many terms can be associated). Furthermore, the need of such a contributive tool historically came from the players themselves as they wanted to become direct contributors of JDM.
