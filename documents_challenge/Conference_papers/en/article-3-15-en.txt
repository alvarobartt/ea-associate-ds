D is the measure of dissimilarity which varies in the range [0,1]. Value 0 means that the two adjacency matrices are identical and therefore the topological structure induced by the two proximity measures is the same. In this case, we talk about topological equivalence between the two proximity measures. Value 1 means that the topology has changed completely, i.e., no pair of neighbors in the topological structure induced by the first proximity measure, only stayed close in the topological structure induced by the second measure and vice versa. D also interpreted as the percentage of disagreement between adjacency tables.
