We observe that confidence and growth rate values of extracted rules are clearly unstable from train to test data. The same observation arises when considering lift values: when li f t = 2, then there is a positive correlation between the body of the rule and the class attribute. However, this correlation is not always confirmed in test phase. Thus, confidence, growth rate and lift do not allow us to determine whether a rule is robust: a “good” rule w.r.t. confidence (or growth rate) in training phase may turn out to be weak in test phase.
