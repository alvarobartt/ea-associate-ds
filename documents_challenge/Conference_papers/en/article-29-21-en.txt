The annotation study highlighted some potential problems for the automatic iden- tification of the classes described in our typology. First, several phenomena may occur simultaneously, e.g. a diathesis (grammatical voice) transformation may include a correction on a non-word error. In this case, an automatic classifier should be able to assign several classes to a modification segment.
