Since version 2, relations as derivationally related form makes it possible to link adjectives to verbs or adjectives to names. In the same way, an usage domain can be addressed to synsets. However, the number of these data still seem too restricted to be sufficiently relevant. Typical relations as ,teacher--,student- ,boat--,port- or ,doctor-- ,hospital-, often essential to a task of lexical disambiguation, are not still present and the restricted number of thematic indications like domain does not make it possible to compensate this defect. Several solutions were proposed to solve whole or part of this problem.
