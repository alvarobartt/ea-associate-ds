In any case, the built lexical network is not free of errors which are corrected along their discovery. Past experience shows that players and contributors complete the resource on terms that interest them. Thus a large number of obvious relations are not contained in the lexical network but are indeed necessary for a high quality resources usable in various NLP application and notably semantic analysis. For example, contributors seldom indicate that a particular bird type can fly, as it is considered an obvious generality. Only notable facts which are not easily deductible are contributed. Well known exceptions are also generally contributed and take the form of a negative weight for the relation (for example, fly agent:100 ostrich).
