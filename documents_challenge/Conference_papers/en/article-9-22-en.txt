A substitution node (like D?) gives a negative node, which will unify with the root of an a tree. A ÃŸ-tree gives a white root node and a black foot node, which will unify with the upper and the lower part of a split node. This is why the root and the foot node are linked by a positive dominance link, which will unify with a negative dominance link connecting the two parts of a split node.
