This paper presents a new family of formalisms, Polarized Unification Grammars (PUGs). PUGs extend Unification Grammars with an explicit control of the saturation of structures by attributing a polarity to each object. Using polarities allows integrating the treatment of saturation in the formalism of the rules. Thus the processing of saturation will pilot the combination of structures during the generation processing. Some polarities are neutral, others are not, but a final structure must be completely neutral. Two nonneutral objects can unify (that is, identify) and form a neutral object (that is, neutralizing each other).
