In this article, we first present the principles behind of lexical network construction with crowdsourcing and games with a purpose (also know as human-based computation game) and exemplified them with the JeuxDe- Mots project. Then, we present the outline of an elicitation engine based on an inference engine and a reconciliation engine. An experimentation is then reported on the performances of the system.
