Although being very different in nature, these two viewpoints argue that constraint propagation is an efficient tool for disambiguating natural language. Furthermore, the general properties of feature grammars [8] lead several authors to point the resemblance between these notions and frames or objects, and also the need for multiple inheritance[14].
