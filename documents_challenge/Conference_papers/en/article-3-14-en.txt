For a given neighborhood property, each of these two distances generates a topological structure on the objects E. A topological structure is fully described by its adjacency matrix. Note Vui and Vuj the two adjacency matrices associated with two topological structures. To measure the degree of similarity between graphs, we only need to count the number of discordances between the two adjacency matrices. The matrix is symmetric, we can then calculate this amount by:
