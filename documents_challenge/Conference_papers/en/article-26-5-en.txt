Configurators have proved their capacity to handle complex constrained object models in many industrial situations. By doing so, they address the general goal of dealing with the semantics of some field of knowledge. The dominating approach to natural language parsing views syntax and semantics as two separate issues, addressed by different formalisms (e.g. hpsg for syntax + and lambda calculus plus logic for semantics). We relate here experiments conducted with a radically different viewpoint, an answer to the question : can a configurator deal with both the semantics and the syntax of a given knowledge field?
