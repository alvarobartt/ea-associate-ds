exivity, symmetry and triangular inequality only for the subset of items which doesn't accept antonyms. In this case, nonewithstanding the noise level, the measure is equal to the angular distance. In the general case, it doesn't verify re exivity. The conceptual vector components are positive and we have the property: Distanti 2 [0; 2 ].
