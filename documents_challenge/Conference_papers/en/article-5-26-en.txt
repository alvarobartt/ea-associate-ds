Conclusion We introduced a post-processing procedure to improve the quality of a hierarchical clustering of a network. This is achieved by iteratively removing the internal clusters that decrease a multilevel quality measure. Our method was applied to the algorithm of Blondel et al.[2] by using a generalization of the modularity metric to hierarchical clusterings. The experiments run on random graphs clearly show that the hierarchies we provide are very close to the ground truth hierarchies. Results obtained on real networks are also meaningful.
