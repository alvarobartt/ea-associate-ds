The results obtained using the algorithm of [2] without our method provides similar results. Using our procedure, the first level is removed and contains subgraphs with a small graph diameter that may correspond to close collaboration within same research teams. A visualization of the results is given in Figure 3. The clusterings N1(T) and N2(T) are drawn using blue and grey concave hulls respectively.
