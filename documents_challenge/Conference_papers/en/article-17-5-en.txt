These semantic relation agents can compute the pertinence of a semantic relation between two acceptions by combining various lexical informations and conceptual vectors. When a given pertinence score is above a threshold, they create a semantic link which can be walked throught by other agents in charge of WSD ot lexical transfert. Base integrity agents walk throw the acceptions and according to their speciality create semantic links, look for incoherences in the base and emit warnings toward lexicographs when neened. In this paper, we first expose the conceptual vectors model, then, the acceptance model, a few reviewing on semantics relations in an acceptions base and then we present precisely a detailled example with antonymy.
