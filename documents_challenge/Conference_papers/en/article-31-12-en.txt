These markers can be indexed in two types: releasing indicators and complementary indexes (Minel, 2002). The releasing indicators state important concepts which are relevant for the task of automatic summarization. The complementary indexes are required in a space defined starting from the indicator (in the vicinity of the indicator). They can thus act in the context in order to confirm or to cancel the rhetorical relation stated by the releasing indicator.
