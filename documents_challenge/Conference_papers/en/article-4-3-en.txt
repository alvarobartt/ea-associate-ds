The aim of this paper is to propose a comparative analysis of some of these approaches and of the associated tools, implementing mentioned techniques. To provide a coherent framework for comparing approaches, we have used Methontology [Fernandez et al., 1997], one of the most known methodologies for ontology construction, supplying a set of reference tasks necessaries to build an ontology.
