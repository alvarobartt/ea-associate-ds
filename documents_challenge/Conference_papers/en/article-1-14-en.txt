Original data sets. In figures 2 and 3, we report scatter plots for the study of the evolution (from train set to test set) of confidence values of extracted rules. We also compare the values of the MODL criterion. As expected, for all data sets, we observe that confidence is unstable from train to test: indeed, a highly confident rule in train may have low confidence in test (see the points far from the identity line). Conversely, the MODL level values of extracted rules are rather stable in the traintest experiments (see the points close to the identity line).
