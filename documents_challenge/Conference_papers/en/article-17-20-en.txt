These materialised valued links can be walked through by standart agents (which can't compute the semantic relation value by themselves) which can, with few simple rules, quickly evaluate relations values between two acceptions. For example, an agent can use the transitivity property of hyperonymy to evaluate le values of Hyp(A;C) from Hyp(A;B) and Hyp(B;C). This can be usefull if the acception base is used for a word sense desambiguation, for example. In no case, a non-expert agent can build a link.
