This article describes conceptual vectors that allows the representation of ideas in any textual segment and offers a continuous vision of related thematics, based on the distances between these thematics. We show the characteristics of conceptual vectors and explain how they complement lexico-semantic networks. We illustrate this purpose by adding conceptual vectors to WordNet by emergence.
