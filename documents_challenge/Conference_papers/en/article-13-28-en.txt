Multiword prepositions We obtained a list of 222 multiword prepositions, among which 18 appear in verb subcategorization frames (see table 3). It is to be noticed that only DICOVALENCE and SynLex contain multiword prepositions in verb subcategorization frames. As for Lefff, it provides an impressive list of multiword prepositions (more than 150) which represents an excellent basis for our work.
