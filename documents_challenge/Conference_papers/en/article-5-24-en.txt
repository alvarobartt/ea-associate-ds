The Infomap algorithm does not find any hierarchical structure in this network. The biggest identified communities correspond to California, Texas and the East of the country. On the opposite, the Oslom algorithm provides a deep hierarchical clustering tree. The first level contains mostly two very big communities corresponding to the West/Mid-West area and the East. These clusters are then divided over two additional levels. The bottom clustering corresponds to the clustering provided by the Infomap algorithm.
