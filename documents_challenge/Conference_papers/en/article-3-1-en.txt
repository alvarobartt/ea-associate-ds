In this paper, we propose a new approach to compare the proximity measures. This approach is based on the topological equivalence which exploits the concept of local neighbors and defines an equivalence between two proximity measures by having the same neighborhood structure on the objects.We compare the two approaches, the pre-ordering and our approach, to thirty five proximity measures using the continuous and binary attributes of empirical data sets.
