As we have shown, most previous works on Wikipedia's revision history focus on specific aspects of the resource and target well-defined applications such as text simpli fication, sentence compression or textual entailment. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive overview of the local modifi- cation phenomena available in Wikipedia's revisions, although there is a large variety of types of local modifications that are of interest for many NLP applications.
