This elementary structure is a “cell” whose upper frontier is a string of positive edges corresponding to the left part of the rule, while the lower frontier is a string of negative edges corresponding to the right part of the rule. Each positive edge must unify with a negative edge and vice versa, in order to give a black edge. Nodes are grey (= absolutely neutral) and their unification is entirely driven by the unification of edges.
