For each experiment, we test our approach for the translation of terms from French to English and from English to French. The inference process is repeated 10 times: the initial set is divided in 10 folds and ostia uses 9 of these folds; the tenth fold is different each time. Thus, ten transducers are inferred; this allows us to average their results (see Section 4). Each test set comprises 2000 pairs (of course different from the training pairs).
