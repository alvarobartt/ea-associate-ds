Exploitation of relations The exploitation of the relations is done at two level : (1) for the vector construction, they build in a complementary way to the definitions the vector of a synset; (2) to avoid phenomenon of regrouping of distinct sets. Vectors Construction The construction of a conceptual vector is done for each node of the network by simple weighted normalised sum of the vectors of the linked nodes. If N is a node linked to k nodes N1 . . .Nk, the vector of N is V(N) = p1V(N1)+ p2V(N2)+. . .+ pkV(Nk) (6)
