The following two examples (1a) and (1b) have the same surface structure, in which the two preposition uses for avec can only be distinguished semantically: in the first case, it introduces an oblique complement, whereas in the second case, it introduces an adjunct. This issue can be solved using finer-grained semantic information. 1a. Jean se bat avec Paul [Jean fights against Paul] 1b. Jean se bat avec courage [Jean fights with courage]
