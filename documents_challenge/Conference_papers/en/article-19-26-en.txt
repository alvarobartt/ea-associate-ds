On the other hand, Table 4 shows that the words selected on the basis of their number of strong links are not strongly linked in WordNet (according to Linâ€™s measure) to their target word. This does not mean that the selected words are not interesting for describing the senses of the target word but more probably that the semantic relations that they share with the target word are different from hyperonymy. The results of Pantel and Lin can be explained by the fact that their algorithm is based on the clustering of similar words, i.e. words that are likely to be synonyms, and not on the clustering of the cooccurrents of a word, which are not often synonyms of that word. Moreover, their initial corpus is much larger (around 144 millions words) than ours and they make use of more elaborated tools, such as a syntactic analyzer.
