Typology of Local Modifications We analysed the WiCoPaCo corpus in order to develop a detailed typology of local modifi- cations in Wikipedia revisions (Dutrey et al., 2011).2 The typology aims at representing all observable phenomena in the WiCoPaCo corpus and accounts for the degree of semantic variation between local modification segments.
