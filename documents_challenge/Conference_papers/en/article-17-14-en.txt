Semantic Links and Integrity Constraints The semantic relations between lexical units help structuring the lexicon on the paradigmatic plane. These well known relations are often described in two types: the hierarchical relations (hyponymy, hyperonymy, meronymy and holonymy) and the equivalence/opposition relations (synonymy, antonymy). In some linguistic research ([Polguere, 2001 ], [Lehmann et Martin-Berthet, 98]) they are defined as boolean relations i.e. they either hold between two words or they don't. For acceptions, which are monosemic, hierarchical relations are transitive and synonymy is considered as an equivalence.
