For several years, TAL team (Natural Language Processing team) from LIRMM (Montpellier Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics, and Microelectronics) works on a formalization of the projection of the linguistic concept of semantic field in a vector space, the conceptual vectors. They allow to represent ideas contained in an unspecified textual segment and allow to obtain a continuous vision of thematic used thanks to the calculable distances between them.
