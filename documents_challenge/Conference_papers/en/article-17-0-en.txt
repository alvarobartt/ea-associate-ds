In the framework of the Papillon project, we have defined strategies for populating a pivot dictionnary of interlingual links from monolingual vectorial bases. There are quite a number of acceptions per entry thus, the proper identification may be quite troublesome and some added clues beside acception links may be useful. We improve the integrity of the acception base through well known semantic relations like synonymy, antonymy, hyperonymy and holonymy relying on lexical functions agents. These semantic relation agents can compute the pertinence of a semantic relation between two acceptions thanks to various lexical informations and conceptual vectors.
