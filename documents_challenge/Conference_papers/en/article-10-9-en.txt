The OSTIA algorithm Ostia is the machine learning technique inferring sub-sequential transducers from examples of French/English pairs of biomedical terms. Ostia is formally presented by J. Oncina (1991); here, we only give an outline of its principles. It is illustrated with an example: we want to learn the transducer presented above in Figure 1 from the training set T containing the 6 following input/output examples: {Â²/D, a/AE, ab/ABF, abc/ABCE, abcb/ABCBF, abcbc/ABCBCE}. Ostia works in three steps (Oncina, 1998): 1. a prefix tree of every input sequence in T is built up. Empty output strings are associated to each internal state and edge of the tree and the complete output strings are associated at the leaves of the branch accepting the corresponding input sequence (cf. Figure 2).
