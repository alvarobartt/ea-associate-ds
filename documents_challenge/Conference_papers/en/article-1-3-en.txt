The same dilemma stands when thresholding interestingness measures like confidence (i.e. an estimation of the probability P(c | X)) or growth rate (which highlights the so-called emerging patterns, i.e. those patterns that frequent in a class of the data set and barely infrequent in the rest of the data [Dong and Li, 1999]): indeed, high confidence (or growth rate) threshold values lead to strong (pure) class association rules which may be rare in real-world data or even wrong when combined with a low frequency threshold whereas “low” thresholds generate a lot of rules with limited interest. Thus, finding a trade-off between frequency and interestingness measure values is not trivial.
