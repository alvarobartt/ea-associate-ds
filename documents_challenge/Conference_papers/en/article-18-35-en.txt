Indeed, the recall of the networks is weak, they easily do not make it possible to represent the semantic fields contrary to the vectors while the latter are not sufficient to represent relations like hyperonymy or meronymy. Our proposal is to benefit from this complementarity while adding toWordNet conceptual vectors built starting from definitions and relations contained in this base.
