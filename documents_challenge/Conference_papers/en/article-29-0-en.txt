Abstract. In this article, we analyse the modifications available in the French Wikip√©dia revision history. We first define a typology of modifications based on a detailed study of a large corpus of modifications. Moreover, we detail a manual annotation study of a subpart of the corpus aimed at assessing the difficulty of automatic paraphrase identification in such a corpus. Finally, we assess a rule-based paraphrase identification tool on a subset of our corpus.
