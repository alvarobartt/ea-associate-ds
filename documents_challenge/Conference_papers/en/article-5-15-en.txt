Discussion on the resulting hierarchy The algorithm of Blondel et al. produces a hierarchy T by iteratively applying a flat clustering procedure (the first phase described above) to the quotient graph created at the previous iteration. Each level of T can be seen as a local maximum of the modularity. The authors suggest that the last level found N1(T) is the most meaningful since it corresponds to the highest modularity reached.
