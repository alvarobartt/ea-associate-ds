The complementarity of resources considered here is still an open question, al- though we show that intersecting similarities as simply as we did here is already providing some gain in precision. A more interesting path is probably to combine this with pattern-based approaches, either as another filter or to help selecting productive patterns to start with. The main problem for word similarity mea- sures based on any kind of distribution regularity remains to deal with polysemy, especially when different senses have very different frequency use.
