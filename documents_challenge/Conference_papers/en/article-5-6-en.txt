Optimizing a hierarchical community structure Definitions Given a graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of vertices and E the set of edges. A flat clustering of G is a partition of the vertices V in several groups (also called communities when they are densely connected) defining a set of induced subgraphs of G. In the example provided in Figure 1(a), the vertices falling into the hulls labelled {1,2,3} correspond to three subgraphs.
