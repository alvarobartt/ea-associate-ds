Co-publication network We first look at a co-publication network in social network analysis (see [6] for more details). The graph contains 515 authors (vertices), two authors are linked when they are co-authors in at least one paper. The graph contains 1318 edges. The Oslom and Infomap algorithms detect big clusters at the top level (with over a hundred people). While these clusters can be easily separated from the rest of the network by removing a couple of edges, they are not densely connected. In particular they contain a lot of biconnected components.
