The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the approach used to evaluate the quality of a hierarchical community structure. In section 3, we provide an application of our approach to the algorithm of Blondel et al.. In section 4, we show that our procedure is efficient by describing some results obtained on a hierarchically clustered graph benchmark and on real world examples. We compare our results to those produced by two different state-of-the-art procedures[10, 15].
