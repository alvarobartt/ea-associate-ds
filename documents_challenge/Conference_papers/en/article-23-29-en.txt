Conclusion In this paper we presented some issues in building a lexico-semantic network with games and user contributions and inferring new relations from existing ones. Such a network is highly lexicalized and word usages are discovered incrementally along its construction. Errors are naturally present in the resources as they might come from games played for difficult relations, but they are usually discovered by contributors for terms they are interested in. The same observation is generally done on what contributors contribute.
