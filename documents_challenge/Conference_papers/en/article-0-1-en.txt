It is becoming accepted that leveraging query logs would help the user analyzing large databases or data warehouses [10]. As a clear evidence of this, it has recently been shown that browsing and querying logs actually speeds up the query formulation, by supporting better query reuse [11]. This is particularly relevant in a collaborative context for instance to issue recommendations [3, 7, 8, 19]. But to the best of our knowledge, even the simple problem of providing the end user with a concise representation of what is inside a large log has rarely been addressed, apart from helping a DBA to tune the RDBMS [10].
