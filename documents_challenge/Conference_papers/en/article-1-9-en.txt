The two last key points of the SCRM definition lead us to a notion of rule that extend the “classical” association and classification rule. Indeed, for a given binary attribute a, the values 0 and 1 are two possible values belonging to the body. This may be related to the notion of rules with negations of attributes in their body (see [Antonie and Zaïane, 2004]). SCRM is also related to the recently introduced dis- tribution rule [Jorge et al., 2006]. The consequent of such a rule is a probabilistic distribution over the classes (instead of being a class value). The following example illustrates these two differences.
