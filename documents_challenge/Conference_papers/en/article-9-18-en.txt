Cells will unify with each other to give a final structure representing the derivation structure of a sequence, which is the lower edge of this structure. The next figure shows the derivation structure of the sequence Peter eats red beans with a standard phrase structure grammar, which can be reconstructed by the reader. In such a representation, edges represent phrases and correspond to intervals in the cutting of the sequence, while nodes are bounds of these intervals.
