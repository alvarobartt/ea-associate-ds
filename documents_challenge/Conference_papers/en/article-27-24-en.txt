This approach naturally involves an agglomeration of the vectors. It is thus necessary to increase the contrast of one vector following its computation.With this intention, one calculates the coefficient of variation 2 of V. If this last is not around 10% of the average CV the vector undergoes a nonlinear operation of amplification (exponentiation of each component then normalisation), and this in a reiterated way until obtaining a coefficient of variation in the acceptable values. This last was estimated starting from predifined concepts.
