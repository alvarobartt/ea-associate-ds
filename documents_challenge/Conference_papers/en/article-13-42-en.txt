Segmentation issues The first issue that appears when integrating prepositions in a parsing system is that of segmentation. In particular, contractions have to be processed specifically so that au is identified as the equivalent of `a le. The same goes for de, which can appear in some multiword prepositions and can be elided as d’. However, these phenomena are not specific to prepositions. They can be addressed either in the lexicon (for example Lefff explicitly contains both au cours de and au cours d’), or during the segmentation step.
