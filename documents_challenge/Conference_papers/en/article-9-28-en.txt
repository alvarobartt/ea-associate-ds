But above all, the PUG formalism allows us to write separately several modules of the grammar handling various structures and to put them together in a same formalism by synchronization of the grammars, as we show with our translation of LFG. Thus PUGs extend unification grammars based on feature structures by allowing a greatest diversity of geometric structures and a best control of resources. Further investigations must concern the computational properties of PUGs, notably restrictions allowing polynomial time parsing.
