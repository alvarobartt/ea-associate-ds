This paper focuses on the validation of such hierarchies. We provide an optimization procedure allowing to filter out undesirable fusion of clusters. We enforce this post-procedure on the results produced by the algorithm of Blondel et al.[2]. For this purpose we introduce a generalisation of the modularity quality measure in order to quantify the quality of a hierarchical clustering.
