The results show a similar behavior of the method on both Verbmobil and Booking. We see that the local features at the NP level are relevant for obtaining good precision. The EDU-level and the discursive features improve the recall and F-measure in all three test configurations. The improvement is more marked in the second and third tests. This might be because the ontology, less suited to these tests, has a lower impact on performance. Finally, for Verbmobil, we obtain an F-measure of 86.8%, i.e. almost 20% above the third baseline (simple classifier) and more than 10% above the second baseline (based on the ontology).
