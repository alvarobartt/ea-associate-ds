Valued Semantic Relations Valued semantic relations (RSV) are not boolean and hold a value which express the relevance of the relation between two acceptions. A valued semantic relation R is a relation which gives, for two items, a value between 0 and 1: R : w2 ! [0; 1] with w as the set of the lexical units. The nearest from 1 the value is, the more relevant the relation between the two items is. The nearest from 0 the value is, less relevant the relation between the two items is.
