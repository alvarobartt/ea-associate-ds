On the contrary, conceptual vectors can’t be used to disambiguate terms which are in different semantic fields. We can even note that an analysis only based on them can lead to misinterpretation. For example, the French noun ,avocat- has two meanings. It is the equivalent of ,lawyer- and the equivalent of ,avocado-. In the French sentence ”L’avocat a mang´e un fruit.”, ”The lawyer has eaten a fruit”, ,to eat- and ,fruit- carry idea of ,food- then the acception computed by conceptual vectors for ,avocat- will be ,avocado-. It would have been necessary that the knowledge ”a lawyer is a human” and ”a human eats” can be identified, something that is not possible with only conceptual vectors. Alone, they are not sufficient to exploit lexical functions instanciations in the texts, a lexical network can thus contribute to correct these shortcomings. These limits were shown in experiments for the semantic analysis using ant algorithms in [20].
