We also introduced two main improvements to the SNN algorithm. The first one is the addition of a new step between the last two ones. This comes from the following observation: although a sense seed can be associated to another one during the step 5, which means that the two senses they represent are merged, some clusters that actually correspond to one sense are not merged. This problem is observed with the first and the second order cooccurrences and cannot be solved, without merging unrelated senses, only by adjusting the threshold that controls the association of a cooccurrent to a sense seed.
