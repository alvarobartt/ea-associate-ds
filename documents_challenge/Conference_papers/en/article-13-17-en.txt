UNL (Universal Networking Language (SÂ´erasset and Boitet, 2000)), is a French to disambiguated English dictionary for machine translation, which contains syntactic information in its French part (see table 1 for a UNL example entry). UNL has limited coverage (less than 27,000 lemmas), but it provides, in the English part, semantic information that we will consider using in the near future. UNL contains 48 simple prepositions, among which 12 appear in verb subcategorization frames.
