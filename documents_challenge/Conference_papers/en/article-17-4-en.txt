As there are quite a number of word meaning per entry (roughly 5 for French in our experiments with about 87000 entries) thus, the proper identification of corresponding acceptions may be quite troublesome and some added clues beside acceptions links may be usefull. To do so, we improve the integrity of the acception base through well known semantic relations like synonymy, antonymy, holonymy and hyponomy relying on lexical functions agents.
