Abstract In this paper, we propose a method for summarizing OLAP query logs. The basic idea is that a query summarizes another query and that a log, which is a sequence of queries, summarizes another log. Our framework allows to declaratively specify a summary, and includes a measure to assess the quality of the summaries.We also propose several strategies for automatically computing a good quality summary of a query log, and we show how some simple properties on the summaries can be used to query the log efficiently. Tests on MDX query logs showed the usefulness of our approach.
