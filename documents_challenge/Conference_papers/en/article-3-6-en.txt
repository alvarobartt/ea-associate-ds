A proximity measure can be defined in differentways, under assumptions and axioms that are sought, this will lead to measures with diverse and varied properties. The notion of proximity covers several meanings such as similarity, resemblance, dissimilarity, etc. In the literature, we can find a lot of measures that differ from each other depending on many factors such as the type of the used data (binary, quantitative, qualitative fuzzy...). Therefore, the choice of proximity measure remains an important issue.
