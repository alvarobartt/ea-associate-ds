In the framework of semantic analysis as the one which interests us, we use angular distance to benefit from mutual information carried by conceptual vectors to make lexical disambiguation on words whose meanings are in close semantic fields. Thus, ”Zidane scored a goal.” can be disambiguated thanks to common ideas about sport while ”The lawyer pleads at the court.” can be disambiguated thanks to those of justice. Furthermore, for prepositionnal attachments, vectors can permit in ”He saw the girl with the telescope.” to attach ”with a telescope” to the verb ”saw” due to ideas about vision.
