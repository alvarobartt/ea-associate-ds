We follow J. Apresjan's definition of regular polysemy : "Polysemy of a word A with the meaning ai and aj is called regular if, in the given language, there exists at least one other word B with the meaning bi and bj , which are semantically distinguished from each other in exactly the same way as ai and aj and if ai and bi, aj and bj are non-synonymous." (Apresjan, 1974)
