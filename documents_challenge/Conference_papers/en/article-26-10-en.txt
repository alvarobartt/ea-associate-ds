Algorithms left aside, property grammars involve two important notions : categories represent all recognized syntactic units (either linked with an isolated word or a word group), and properties (a synonym for constraints) apply to these categories, so as to specify well formedness grammar rules and phrase cohesion rules. Categories are mapped to both the words and the phrases of a sentence. For example, the figure 9 shows that "la porte" is a nounphrase where "la" is a determiner and "porte" a noun. To each of this three words or word groups is associated a category, NP, Det and N respectively.
