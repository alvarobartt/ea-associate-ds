Some teams have also migrate. For example it seems that the language used in Cryptography (that is part of A in the a priori categorization) is closer to the language used in math (M). Looking at the 4-cluster partition, some mi- grations are also clearly detected, which have a political sense, in particular when the concerned team is found in a cluster corresponding to the ”right” category in a former categorization done by INRIA. Finally, is seems that teams in the C category share the same language as teams in M or in P stressing the fact that in the activity report the weight of the scientific foun- dations is important, and this fact showing up in both partitions is however clearer in the 4-cluster partition than in the 9-cluster one.
