As far as we know, this technique has never been used for building semantic networks. InNLP, other Web-based systems exist, such as Open Mind Word Expert [13], which aims at creating large sense-tagged corpora with the help ofWeb users, and SemKey [14] which makes use of WordNet and Wikipedia to disambiguate lexical forms referring to concepts, thus identifying semantic keywords. More than 1200000 games of JeuxDeMots have been played since its launch in September 2007 corresponding of around 20000 hour of cumulated play (with 1 minute per game).
