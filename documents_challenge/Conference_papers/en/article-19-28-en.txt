The second main difference is the fact they discriminate senses in an iterative way. This approach consists in selecting at each step the most obvious sense and then, to update the graph of cooccurrences by discarding the words that make up the new sense. The other senses are then easier to discriminate. We preferred to put emphasis on the ability to gather close or identical senses that are artificially distinguished (see Section 4.3).
