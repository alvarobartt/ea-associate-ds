Property grammars Property grammars [2, 3] are a constraint-based linguistic formalism. [3] both proposes a classification of feature constraints called properties, and a parsing algorithm that attempts to exploit constraint propagation (although in a rather "ad hoc" fashion since no "standard" constraint system is used) so as to solve syntactic ambiguities as early as possible.
