In the present work, we propose a more precise and systematic evaluation of the relations extracted by a mirror and a distributional approaches. This evaluation is conducted on the English language for which widespread resources are available. All the evaluations we conducted in this study concur to the observation that our mirror approach globally outperforms the distributional one described by Lin (1998), which we believe to be a fair reference in the domain.
