These data were built semi-automaticly using information from the network (for example if the genus of the definition, within the meaning of Aristote, has a meaning which is also an hyperonym of the defined synset, it is considered that the meaning of the genus is this hyperonym), of distances between definitions or information about the domain. These data are partly manually controlled and the rate of precision of more than 90%.
