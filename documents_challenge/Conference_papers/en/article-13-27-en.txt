Lefff offers a condensed vision of verbs, in which valence patterns are grouped into one single entry, whereas SynLex uses a flatter representation without disjunction on syntactic categories for argument realization or for optional arguments. To summarize, we could say that DICOVALENCE lies somewhere between Lefff and SynLex, since it uses disjunctive representation but has a finer description of syntactic information and hence splits many entries which are collapsed in Lefff.
