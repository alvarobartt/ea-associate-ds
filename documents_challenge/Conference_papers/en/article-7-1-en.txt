Introduction Acquiring knowledge from texts is a need which has increased during the last years. With the considerable rise of the documents available in electronic format, it is necessary to extract, filter and analyse relevant information from those documents. As an example, the stock market events are numerous and diversified. The stock market experts must analyze these events, in a relatively reasonable time, in order to make important decisions. It is a question, therefore, of annotating the documents presenting the events to be able to extract those which are relevant. In this respect, our work aims at developing of an approach that annotates the news articles.
