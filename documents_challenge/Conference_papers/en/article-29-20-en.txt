We also report the number of identical annotations assigned by 2 to 4 annotators, as well as annotations assigned by a unique annotator (see Table 5). This makes it possible to roughly quantify the phenomena available in the corpus. Interestingly, rephrasings have the largest number of occurrences, followed by strong semantic variations. This tends to prove that Wikipedia revisions constitute a well-suited corpus for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases. Moreover, misalignements are quite few, which shows that the alignment method used for building the WiCoPaCo corpus is precise enough to provide useful modifications.
