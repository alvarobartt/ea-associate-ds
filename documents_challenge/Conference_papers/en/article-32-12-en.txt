We have nine discursive features: (1-6) a set that uses the rhetorical relations that link the current EDU to the preceding or following ones. We noticed that some discourse relations can help highlight EDUs that contain preferences or not. We split discourse relations into three categories: (a) those that “generally” imply a “Nonoutcome”, such as Explanation, Comment and Acknowledgment, (b) those that may imply an “Outcome”, such as Elaboration, Continuation, Indirect QAP and Correction, and (c) those that “generally” imply an “Outcome”. In Verbmobil, 86% of discourse relations are in category (a), while 14% are in category (b).
