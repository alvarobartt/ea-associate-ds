In [7], authors of WordNet (we were at version 1.6) record six weaknesses in the their network constitution: 1. the lack of connections between noun and verb hierarchies; 2. limited number of connections between topicallyrelated words; 3. the lack of morphological relations; 4. the absence of thematic relations/selectional restrictions; 5. some concepts (word senses) and relations are missing; 6. since glosses were written manually, sometimes there is a lack of uniformity and consistency in the definitions. If items 3, 5 and 6 donâ€™t interest us in this article, we will show the conceptual vectors contribution to the resolution of the others, all three constitue the tennis problem.
