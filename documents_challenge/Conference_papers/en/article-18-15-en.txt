Construction of vectors by emergence The approach by emergence is free from any thesaurus and vectors of concept as bases departure. Only d the vector size is fixed a priori. The construction method of the vectors is identical to the traditional model with the difference that if one of the vectors entering the sum is non-existent, because not yet calculated, then this vector is drawn randomly. The computing process is reiterated until convergence of each vector.
