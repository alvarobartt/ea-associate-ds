INTRODUCTION In the current context, we have to deal with a huge mass of electronic textual documents available through the net. We need tools offering fast visualization of the texts (so that the user can evaluate its relevance). Automatic summarization provides a solution which makes it possible to extract interesting information for an advantageous reuse. Indeed, the summary helps the reader to decide whether the original document contains the required information or not. Moreover, in some cases the reader does not need to read the totality of the original document, simply because the required information is in the summary (MÃ¢aloul, 2007).
