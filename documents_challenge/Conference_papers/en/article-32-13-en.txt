Experiments and Results Several experiments were performed for testing the validity of our extraction approach. The first experiment was carried out on Verbmobil (CV ). The training corpus consisted of 25 dialogues, i.e. 2374 NPs, and the test corpus consists of 10 dialogues, i.e. 700 NPs. In the second experiment (CB), the classifier was trained on 15 dialogues from Booking i.e. 837 NPs and tested on 6 dialogues with a total of 312 NPs. Finally, the classifier was evaluated using Verbmobil for training (using the 35 dialogues) and Booking for test (using the 21 dialogues) (CV + CB).
