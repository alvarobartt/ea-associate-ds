Using this kind of networks for evaluating the word senses that we find is of course criticizable as our aim is to overcome their insufficiencies. Nevertheless, as these networks are carefully controlled, such an evaluation provides at least a first judgment about the reliability of the discovered senses. We chose to take up the evaluation method proposed in (Pantel and Lin, 2002). This method relies on WordNet and shows a rather good agreement between its results and human judgments (88% for Pantel and Lin). As a consequence, our evaluation was done only for English, and more precisely with WordNet 1.7.
