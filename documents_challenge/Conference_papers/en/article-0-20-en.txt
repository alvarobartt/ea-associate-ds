Implementation and tests The framework is implemented with Java 6. The implementation has been done considering that dimensions fit in main memory. These dimensions are represented by trees storing for each member the cardinality of its coverage at the most detailed level. Tests have been run on a computer equipped with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E8400 clocked at 3.00 GHz with 3.48 Go of usable RAM, under windows 7 ultimate edition. The logs used are synthetic logs on the Foodmart database example coming with the Mondrian OLAP engine.
