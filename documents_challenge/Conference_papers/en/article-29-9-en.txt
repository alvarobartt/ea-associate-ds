The monolingual parallel corpora is interesting as it involves pairs of text units which are supposed to convey the same content from which it is reasonable to assume that highquality local paraphrases can be automatically acquired (Bouamor, Max, and Vilnat, 2010). Unfortunately, such corpora do not exist in large quantities and are costly to build. A major shortcoming of the other types of corpora used for paraphrase acquisition is that potential paraphrases are only observed indirectly via common translation or contextual similarity.
