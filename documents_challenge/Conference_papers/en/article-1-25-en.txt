About redundancy. A classification rule p2 : Y ? ci is said to be redundant w.r.t. p1 : X ? c j if ci = c j , X ? Y and p1 and p2 brings (almost) the same classdiscriminating power (w.r.t. an interestingness measure) â€“ a redundant rule should be pruned. Consider two itemsets X and Y such that X ? Y and f req(X, r) = f req(Y, r), then for a given interestingness measure m based on frequency, we have m(X) = m(Y) thus some redundancy. It is common to consider support equivalence class to group itemsets having the same support (and frequency).
