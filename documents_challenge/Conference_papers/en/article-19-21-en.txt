Evaluation The discovering of word senses, as most of the work dedicated to the building of linguistic resources, comes up against the problem of evaluating its results. The most direct way of doing it is to compare the resource to evaluate with a similar resource that is acknowledged as a golden standard. For word senses, the WordNet-like lexicosemantic networks can be considered as such a standard.
