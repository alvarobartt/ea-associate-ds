Structures combine by unification. The unification of two structures A and B gives a new structure A?B obtained by “pasting” together these structures and identifying a part of the objects of the first structure with objects of the second structure. When two polarized structures A and B are unified, the polarity of an object of A?B obtained by identifying two objects of A and B is the product of their polarities; if the two objects bear the same map, these maps must be identified and their values, unified. (For instance identifying two edges forces us to identify their sources and targets.)
