These results show that the program exhibits acceptable computation times for sentences of up to a hundred words. This stems from the fact that the efficiency of constraint propagation allows to reach the solution with a very limited number of fails, specially in analysis mode. In analysis mode again, the fact that the program exits with no choice point when the entry is inconsistent (a(51) b(49) and + a(50) b(49)) stems from the fact that constraint propagation alone detects failure.
