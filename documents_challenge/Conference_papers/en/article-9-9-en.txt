A Polarized Unification Grammar (PUG) is defined by a finite family T of types of objects, a set of maps attached to the objects of each type, a system (P,.) of polarities, a subset N of P of neutral polarities, and a finite subset of elementary polarized structures, whose objects are described by T; one elementary structure is marked as the initial one and must be used exactly once. The structures generated by the grammar are the neutral structures obtained by combining the initial structure and a finite number of elementary structures.
